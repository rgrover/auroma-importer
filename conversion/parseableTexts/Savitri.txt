\PF The writing of {\it Savitri} extended over much of the later part of Sri
Aurobindo's life. The earliest known manuscript is dated 1916. The original
narrative poem was recast several times in the first phase of composition. By
around 1930, Sri Aurobindo had begun to turn it into an epic with a larger
scope and deeper significance.
\par Transformed into “A Legend and a Symbol”, {\it Savitri} became his
major literary work which he continued to expand and perfect until his last
days. In the late 1940s, when his eyesight was failing, he took the help of a
scribe and dictated the extensive final stages of revision.
\par Separate cantos started to appear in print in 1946. Part One of the first
edition was published in 1950. The next year, after Sri Aurobindo's passing,
the rest of the poem was brought out in a second volume.
\par In the second edition (1954), Sri Aurobindo's letters on {\it Savitri} were
added. They are omitted from the present edition and included in {\it Letters
on Poetry and Art}.
\par In 1970 {\it Savitri} was published as volumes 28 and 29 of the Sri
Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library. This edition was reprinted, as a single
volume, a number of times between 1973 and 1990.
\par The fourth (“revised”) edition appeared in 1993. This edition was the
outcome of a systematic comparison of the printed text of {\it Savitri} with
the manuscripts. The 1993 edition has been reprinted several times. In 1997 it
was published as volumes 33 and 34 of the CWSA.
\par The text of the present, electronic, edition (1999) is identical to the text
of the CWSA edition. As the page breaks in the CWSA edition are almost
everywhere identical to the page breaks in the SABCL edition, the SABCL
page numbers have not been given separately for this book.

\ht Author's Note
\par\nodrop
\PF The tale of Satyavan and Savitri is recited in the Mahabharata as a story
of conjugal love conquering death. But this legend is, as shown by many
features of the human tale, one of the many symbolic myths of the Vedic
cycle. Satyavan is the soul carrying the divine truth of being within itself but
descended into the grip of death and ignorance; Savitri is the Divine Word,
daughter of the Sun, goddess of the supreme Truth who comes down and is
born to save; Aswapati, the Lord of the Horse, her human father, is the Lord
of Tapasya, the concentrated energy of spiritual endeavour that helps us to
rise from the mortal to the immortal planes; Dyumatsena, Lord of the Shining
Hosts, father of Satyavan, is the Divine Mind here fallen blind, losing its
celestial kingdom of vision, and through that loss its kingdom of glory. Still this
is not a mere allegory, the characters are not personified qualities, but
incarnations or emanations of living and conscious Forces with whom we can
enter into concrete touch and they take human bodies in order to help man
and show him the way from his mortal state to a divine consciousness and
immortal life.

\sbigcap It was the hour before the Gods awake.\nl
Across the path of the divine Event\nl
The huge foreboding mind of Night, alone\nl
In her unlit temple of eternity,\nl
Lay stretched immobile upon Silence' marge.\nl
Almost one felt, opaque, impenetrable,\nl
In the sombre symbol of her eyeless muse\nl
The abysm of the unbodied Infinite;\nl
A fathomless zero occupied the world.\nl
A power of fallen boundless self awake\nl
Between the first and the last Nothingness,\nl
Recalling the tenebrous womb from which it came,\nl
Turned from the insoluble mystery of birth\nl
And the tardy process of mortality\nl
And longed to reach its end in vacant Nought.\nl
As in a dark beginning of all things,\nl
A mute featureless semblance of the Unknown\nl
Repeating for ever the unconscious act,\nl
Prolonging for ever the unseeing will,\nl
Cradled the cosmic drowse of ignorant Force\nl
Whose moved creative slumber kindles the suns\nl
And carries our lives in its somnambulist whirl.\nl
Athwart the vain enormous trance of Space,\nl
Its formless stupor without mind or life,\nl
A shadow spinning through a soulless Void,\nl
Thrown back once more into unthinking dreams,\nl
Earth wheeled abandoned in the hollow gulfs\nl
Forgetful of her spirit and her fate.\nl
The impassive skies were neutral, empty, still.\nl
Then something in the inscrutable darkness stirred;\nl
A nameless movement, an unthought Idea\nl
Page 1

Insistent, dissatisfied, without an aim,\nl
Something that wished but knew not how to be,\nl
Teased the Inconscient to wake Ignorance.\nl
A throe that came and left a quivering trace,\nl
Gave room for an old tired want unfilled,\nl
At peace in its subconscient moonless cave\nl
To raise its head and look for absent light,\nl
Straining closed eyes of vanished memory,\nl
Like one who searches for a bygone self\nl
And only meets the corpse of his desire.\nl
It was as though even in this Nought's profound,\nl
Even in this ultimate dissolution's core,\nl
There lurked an unremembering entity,\nl
Survivor of a slain and buried past\nl
Condemned to resume the effort and the pang,\nl
Reviving in another frustrate world.\nl
An unshaped consciousness desired light\nl
And a blank prescience yearned towards distant change.\nl
As if a childlike finger laid on a cheek\nl
Reminded of the endless need in things\nl
The heedless Mother of the universe,\nl
An infant longing clutched the sombre Vast.\nl
Insensibly somewhere a breach began:\nl
A long lone line of hesitating hue\nl
Like a vague smile tempting a desert heart\nl
Troubled the far rim of life's obscure sleep.\nl
Arrived from the other side of boundlessness\nl
An eye of deity peered through the dumb deeps;\nl
A scout in a reconnaissance from the sun,\nl
It seemed amid a heavy cosmic rest,\nl
The torpor of a sick and weary world,\nl
To seek for a spirit sole and desolate\nl
Too fallen to recollect forgotten bliss.\nl
Intervening in a mindless universe,\nl
Its message crept through the reluctant hush\nl
Calling the adventure of consciousness and joy\nl
Page 2

And, conquering Nature's disillusioned breast,\nl
Compelled renewed consent to see and feel.\nl
A thought was sown in the unsounded Void,\nl
A sense was born within the darkness' depths,\nl
A memory quivered in the heart of Time\nl
As if a soul long dead were moved to live:\nl
But the oblivion that succeeds the fall,\nl
Had blotted the crowded tablets of the past,\nl
And all that was destroyed must be rebuilt\nl
And old experience laboured out once more.\nl
All can be done if the god-touch is there.\nl
A hope stole in that hardly dared to be\nl
Amid the Night's forlorn indifference.\nl
As if solicited in an alien world\nl
With timid and hazardous instinctive grace,\nl
Orphaned and driven out to seek a home,\nl
An errant marvel with no place to live,\nl
Into a far-off nook of heaven there came\nl
A slow miraculous gesture's dim appeal.\nl
The persistent thrill of a transfiguring touch\nl
Persuaded the inert black quietude\nl
And beauty and wonder disturbed the fields of God.\nl
A wandering hand of pale enchanted light\nl
That glowed along a fading moment's brink,\nl
Fixed with gold panel and opalescent hinge\nl
A gate of dreams ajar on mystery's verge.\nl
One lucent corner windowing hidden things\nl
Forced the world's blind immensity to sight.\nl
The darkness failed and slipped like a falling cloak\nl
From the reclining body of a god.\nl
Then through the pallid rift that seemed at first\nl
Hardly enough for a trickle from the suns,\nl
Outpoured the revelation and the flame.\nl
The brief perpetual sign recurred above.\nl
A glamour from unreached transcendences\nl
Iridescent with the glory of the Unseen,\nl
Page 3

A message from the unknown immortal Light\nl
Ablaze upon creation's quivering edge,\nl
Dawn built her aura of magnificent hues\nl
And buried its seed of grandeur in the hours.\nl
An instant's visitor the godhead shone.\nl
On life's thin border awhile the Vision stood\nl
And bent over earth's pondering forehead curve.\nl
Interpreting a recondite beauty and bliss\nl
In colour's hieroglyphs of mystic sense,\nl
It wrote the lines of a significant myth\nl
Telling of a greatness of spiritual dawns,\nl
A brilliant code penned with the sky for page.\nl
Almost that day the epiphany was disclosed\nl
Of which our thoughts and hopes are signal flares;\nl
A lonely splendour from the invisible goal\nl
Almost was flung on the opaque Inane.\nl
Once more a tread perturbed the vacant Vasts;\nl
Infinity's centre, a Face of rapturous calm\nl
Parted the eternal lids that open heaven;\nl
A Form from far beatitudes seemed to near.\nl
Ambassadress twixt eternity and change,\nl
The omniscient Goddess leaned across the breadths\nl
That wrap the fated journeyings of the stars\nl
And saw the spaces ready for her feet.\nl
Once she half looked behind for her veiled sun,\nl
Then, thoughtful, went to her immortal work.\nl
Earth felt the Imperishable's passage close:\nl
The waking ear of Nature heard her steps\nl
And wideness turned to her its limitless eye,\nl
And, scattered on sealed depths, her luminous smile\nl
Kindled to fire the silence of the worlds.\nl
All grew a consecration and a rite.\nl
Air was a vibrant link between earth and heaven;\nl
The wide-winged hymn of a great priestly wind\nl
Arose and failed upon the altar hills;\nl
The high boughs prayed in a revealing sky.\nl
Page 4

Here where our half-lit ignorance skirts the gulfs\nl
On the dumb bosom of the ambiguous earth,\nl
Here where one knows not even the step in front\nl
And Truth has her throne on the shadowy back of doubt,\nl
On this anguished and precarious field of toil\nl
Outspread beneath some large indifferent gaze,\nl
Impartial witness of our joy and bale,\nl
Our prostrate soil bore the awakening ray.\nl
Here too the vision and prophetic gleam\nl
Lit into miracles common meaningless shapes;\nl
Then the divine afflatus, spent, withdrew,\nl
Unwanted, fading from the mortal's range.\nl
A sacred yearning lingered in its trace,\nl
The worship of a Presence and a Power\nl
Too perfect to be held by death-bound hearts,\nl
The prescience of a marvellous birth to come.\nl
Only a little the god-light can stay:\nl
Spiritual beauty illumining human sight\nl
Lines with its passion and mystery Matter's mask\nl
And squanders eternity on a beat of Time.\nl
As when a soul draws near the sill of birth,\nl
Adjoining mortal time to Timelessness,\nl
A spark of deity lost in Matter's crypt\nl
Its lustre vanishes in the inconscient planes,\nl
That transitory glow of magic fire\nl
So now dissolved in bright accustomed air.\nl
The message ceased and waned the messenger.\nl
The single Call, the uncompanioned Power,\nl
Drew back into some far-off secret world\nl
The hue and marvel of the supernal beam:\nl
She looked no more on our mortality.\nl
The excess of beauty natural to god-kind\nl
Could not uphold its claim on time-born eyes;\nl
Too mystic-real for space-tenancy\nl
Her body of glory was expunged from heaven:\nl
The rarity and wonder lived no more.\nl
Page 5

There was the common light of earthly day.\nl
Affranchised from the respite of fatigue\nl
Once more the rumour of the speed of Life\nl
Pursued the cycles of her blinded quest.\nl
All sprang to their unvarying daily acts;\nl
The thousand peoples of the soil and tree\nl
Obeyed the unforeseeing instant's urge,\nl
And, leader here with his uncertain mind,\nl
Alone who stares at the future's covered face,\nl
Man lifted up the burden of his fate.\nl

\spar And Savitri too awoke among these tribes\nl
That hastened to join the brilliant Summoner's chant\nl
And, lured by the beauty of the apparent ways,\nl
Acclaimed their portion of ephemeral joy.\nl
Akin to the eternity whence she came,\nl
No part she took in this small happiness;\nl
A mighty stranger in the human field,\nl
The embodied Guest within made no response.\nl
The call that wakes the leap of human mind,\nl
Its chequered eager motion of pursuit,\nl
Its fluttering-hued illusion of desire,\nl
Visited her heart like a sweet alien note.\nl
Time's message of brief light was not for her.\nl
In her there was the anguish of the gods\nl
Imprisoned in our transient human mould,\nl
The deathless conquered by the death of things.\nl
A vaster Nature's joy had once been hers,\nl
But long could keep not its gold heavenly hue\nl
Or stand upon this brittle earthly base.\nl
A narrow movement on Time's deep abysm,\nl
Life's fragile littleness denied the power,\nl
The proud and conscious wideness and the bliss\nl
She had brought with her into the human form,\nl
The calm delight that weds one soul to all,\nl
The key to the flaming doors of ecstasy.\nl
Page 6

Earth's grain that needs the sap of pleasure and tears\nl
Rejected the undying rapture's boon:\nl
Offered to the daughter of infinity\nl
Her passion-flower of love and doom she gave.\nl
In vain now seemed the splendid sacrifice.\nl
A prodigal of her rich divinity,\nl
Her self and all she was she had lent to men,\nl
Hoping her greater being to implant\nl
And in their body's lives acclimatise\nl
That heaven might native grow on mortal soil.\nl
Hard is it to persuade earth-nature's change;\nl
Mortality bears ill the eternal's touch:\nl
It fears the pure divine intolerance\nl
Of that assault of ether and of fire;\nl
It murmurs at its sorrowless happiness,\nl
Almost with hate repels the light it brings;\nl
It trembles at its naked power of Truth\nl
And the might and sweetness of its absolute Voice.\nl
Inflicting on the heights the abysm's law,\nl
It sullies with its mire heaven's messengers:\nl
Its thorns of fallen nature are the defence\nl
It turns against the saviour hands of Grace;\nl
It meets the sons of God with death and pain.\nl
A glory of lightnings traversing the earth-scene,\nl
Their sun-thoughts fading, darkened by ignorant minds,\nl
Their work betrayed, their good to evil turned,\nl
The cross their payment for the crown they gave,\nl
Only they leave behind a splendid Name.\nl
A fire has come and touched men's hearts and gone;\nl
A few have caught flame and risen to greater life.\nl
Too unlike the world she came to help and save,\nl
Her greatness weighed upon its ignorant breast\nl
And from its dim chasms welled a dire return,\nl
A portion of its sorrow, struggle, fall.\nl
To live with grief, to confront death on her road,—\nl
The mortal's lot became the Immortal's share.\nl
Page 7

Thus trapped in the gin of earthly destinies,\nl
Awaiting her ordeal's hour abode,\nl
Outcast from her inborn felicity,\nl
Accepting life's obscure terrestrial robe,\nl
Hiding herself even from those she loved,\nl
The godhead greater by a human fate.\nl
A dark foreknowledge separated her\nl
From all of whom she was the star and stay;\nl
Too great to impart the peril and the pain,\nl
In her torn depths she kept the grief to come.\nl
As one who watching over men left blind\nl
Takes up the load of an unwitting race,\nl
Harbouring a foe whom with her heart she must feed,\nl
Unknown her act, unknown the doom she faced,\nl
Unhelped she must foresee and dread and dare.\nl
The long-foreknown and fatal morn was here\nl
Bringing a noon that seemed like every noon.\nl
For Nature walks upon her mighty way\nl
Unheeding when she breaks a soul, a life;\nl
Leaving her slain behind she travels on:\nl
Man only marks and God's all-seeing eyes.\nl
Even in this moment of her soul's despair,\nl
In its grim rendezvous with death and fear,\nl
No cry broke from her lips, no call for aid;\nl
She told the secret of her woe to none:\nl
Calm was her face and courage kept her mute.\nl
Yet only her outward self suffered and strove;\nl
Even her humanity was half divine:\nl
Her spirit opened to the Spirit in all,\nl
Her nature felt all Nature as its own.\nl
Apart, living within, all lives she bore;\nl
Aloof, she carried in herself the world:\nl
Her dread was one with the great cosmic dread,\nl
Her strength was founded on the cosmic mights;\nl
The universal Mother's love was hers.\nl
Against the evil at life's afflicted roots,\nl
Page 8

Her own calamity its private sign,\nl
Of her pangs she made a mystic poignant sword.\nl
A solitary mind, a world-wide heart,\nl
To the lone Immortal's unshared work she rose.\nl
At first life grieved not in her burdened breast:\nl
On the lap of earth's original somnolence\nl
Inert, released into forgetfulness,\nl
Prone it reposed, unconscious on mind's verge,\nl
Obtuse and tranquil like the stone and star.\nl
In a deep cleft of silence twixt two realms\nl
She lay remote from grief, unsawn by care,\nl
Nothing recalling of the sorrow here.\nl
Then a slow faint remembrance shadowlike moved,\nl
And sighing she laid her hand upon her bosom\nl
And recognised the close and lingering ache,\nl
Deep, quiet, old, made natural to its place,\nl
But knew not why it was there nor whence it came.\nl
The Power that kindles mind was still withdrawn:\nl
Heavy, unwilling were life's servitors\nl
Like workers with no wages of delight;\nl
Sullen, the torch of sense refused to burn;\nl
The unassisted brain found not its past.\nl
Only a vague earth-nature held the frame.\nl
But now she stirred, her life shared the cosmic load.\nl
At the summons of her body's voiceless call\nl
Her strong far-winging spirit travelled back,\nl
Back to the yoke of ignorance and fate,\nl
Back to the labour and stress of mortal days,\nl
Lighting a pathway through strange symbol dreams\nl
Across the ebbing of the seas of sleep.\nl
Her house of Nature felt an unseen sway,\nl
Illumined swiftly were life's darkened rooms,\nl
And memory's casements opened on the hours\nl
And the tired feet of thought approached her doors.\nl
All came back to her: Earth and Love and Doom,\nl
The ancient disputants, encircled her\nl
Page 9

Like giant figures wrestling in the night:\nl
The godheads from the dim Inconscient born\nl
Awoke to struggle and the pang divine,\nl
And in the shadow of her flaming heart,\nl
At the sombre centre of the dire debate,\nl
A guardian of the unconsoled abyss\nl
Inheriting the long agony of the globe,\nl
A stone-still figure of high and godlike Pain\nl
Stared into Space with fixed regardless eyes\nl
That saw grief's timeless depths but not life's goal.\nl
Afflicted by his harsh divinity,\nl
Bound to his throne, he waited unappeased\nl
The daily oblation of her unwept tears.\nl
All the fierce question of man's hours relived.\nl
The sacrifice of suffering and desire\nl
Earth offers to the immortal Ecstasy\nl
Began again beneath the eternal Hand.\nl
Awake she endured the moments' serried march\nl
And looked on this green smiling dangerous world,\nl
And heard the ignorant cry of living things.\nl
Amid the trivial sounds, the unchanging scene\nl
Her soul arose confronting Time and Fate.\nl
Immobile in herself, she gathered force.\nl
This was the day when Satyavan must die.\nl

\par
\sbigcap Awhile, withdrawn in secret fields of thought,\nl
Her mind moved in a many-imaged past\nl
That lived again and saw its end approach:\nl
Dying, it lived imperishably in her;\nl
Transient and vanishing from transient eyes,\nl
Invisible, a fateful ghost of self,\nl
It bore the future on its phantom breast.\nl
Along the fleeting event's far-backward trail\nl
Regressed the stream of the insistent hours,\nl
And on the bank of the mysterious flood\nl
Peopled with well-loved forms now seen no more\nl
And the subtle images of things that were,\nl
Her witness spirit stood reviewing Time.\nl
All that she once had hoped and dreamed and been,\nl
Flew past her eagle-winged through memory's skies.\nl
As in a many-hued flaming inner dawn,\nl
Her life's broad highways and its sweet bypaths\nl
Lay mapped to her sun-clear recording view,\nl
From the bright country of her childhood's days\nl
And the blue mountains of her soaring youth\nl
And the paradise groves and peacock wings of Love\nl
To joy clutched under the silent shadow of doom\nl
In a last turn where heaven raced with hell.\nl
Twelve passionate months led in a day of fate.\nl
An absolute supernatural darkness falls\nl
On man sometimes when he draws near to God:\nl
An hour arrives when fail all Nature's means;\nl
Forced out from the protecting Ignorance\nl
And flung back on his naked primal need,\nl
He at length must cast from him his surface soul\nl
And be the ungarbed entity within:\nl
Page 11

That hour had fallen now on Savitri.\nl
A point she had reached where life must be in vain\nl
Or, in her unborn element awake,\nl
Her will must cancel her body's destiny.\nl
For only the unborn spirit's timeless power\nl
Can lift the yoke imposed by birth in Time.\nl
Only the Self that builds this figure of self\nl
Can rase the fixed interminable line\nl
That joins these changing names, these numberless lives,\nl
These new oblivious personalities\nl
And keeps still lurking in our conscious acts\nl
The trail of old forgotten thoughts and deeds,\nl
Disown the legacy of our buried selves,\nl
The burdensome heirship to our vanished forms\nl
Accepted blindly by the body and soul.\nl
An episode in an unremembered tale,\nl
Its beginning lost, its motive and plot concealed,\nl
A once living story has prepared and made\nl
Our present fate, child of past energies.\nl
The fixity of the cosmic sequences\nl
Fastened with hidden inevitable links\nl
She must disrupt, dislodge by her soul's force\nl
Her past, a block on the Immortal's road,\nl
Make a rased ground and shape anew her fate.\nl
A colloquy of the original Gods\nl
Meeting upon the borders of the unknown,\nl
Her soul's debate with embodied Nothingness\nl
Must be wrestled out on a dangerous dim background:\nl
Her being must confront its formless Cause,\nl
Against the universe weigh its single self.\nl
On the bare peak where Self is alone with Nought\nl
And life has no sense and love no place to stand,\nl
She must plead her case upon extinction's verge,\nl
In the world's death-cave uphold life's helpless claim\nl
And vindicate her right to be and love.\nl
Altered must be Nature's harsh economy;\nl
Page 12

Acquittance she must win from her past's bond,\nl
An old account of suffering exhaust,\nl
Strike out from Time the soul's long compound debt\nl
And the heavy servitudes of the Karmic Gods,\nl
The slow revenge of unforgiving Law\nl
And the deep need of universal pain\nl
And hard sacrifice and tragic consequence.\nl
Out of a timeless barrier she must break,\nl
Penetrate with her thinking depths the Void's monstrous hush,\nl
Look into the lonely eyes of immortal Death\nl
And with her nude spirit measure the Infinite's night.\nl
The great and dolorous moment now was close.\nl
A mailed battalion marching to its doom,\nl
The last long days went by with heavy tramp,\nl
Long but too soon to pass, too near the end.\nl
Alone amid the many faces loved,\nl
Aware among unknowing happy hearts,\nl
Her armoured spirit kept watch upon the hours\nl
Listening for a foreseen tremendous step\nl
In the closed beauty of the inhuman wilds.\nl
A combatant in silent dreadful lists,\nl
The world unknowing, for the world she stood:\nl
No helper had she save the Strength within;\nl
There was no witness of terrestrial eyes;\nl
The Gods above and Nature sole below\nl
Were the spectators of that mighty strife.\nl
Around her were the austere sky-pointing hills,\nl
And the green murmurous broad deep-thoughted woods\nl
Muttered incessantly their muffled spell.\nl
A dense magnificent coloured self-wrapped life\nl
Draped in the leaves' vivid emerald monotone\nl
And set with chequered sunbeams and blithe flowers\nl
Immured her destiny's secluded scene.\nl
There had she grown to the stature of her spirit:\nl
The genius of titanic silences\nl
Steeping her soul in its wide loneliness\nl
Page 13

Had shown to her her self's bare reality\nl
And mated her with her environment.\nl
Its solitude greatened her human hours\nl
With a background of the eternal and unique.\nl
A force of spare direct necessity\nl
Reduced the heavy framework of man's days\nl
And his overburdening mass of outward needs\nl
To a first thin strip of simple animal wants,\nl
And the mighty wildness of the primitive earth\nl
And the brooding multitude of patient trees\nl
And the musing sapphire leisure of the sky\nl
And the solemn weight of the slowly-passing months\nl
Had left in her deep room for thought and God.\nl
There was her drama's radiant prologue lived.\nl
A spot for the eternal's tread on earth\nl
Set in the cloistral yearning of the woods\nl
And watched by the aspiration of the peaks\nl
Appeared through an aureate opening in Time,\nl
Where stillness listening felt the unspoken word\nl
And the hours forgot to pass towards grief and change.\nl
Here with the suddenness divine advents have,\nl
Repeating the marvel of the first descent,\nl
Changing to rapture the dull earthly round,\nl
Love came to her hiding the shadow, Death.\nl
Well might he find in her his perfect shrine.\nl
Since first the earth-being's heavenward growth began,\nl
Through all the long ordeal of the race,\nl
Never a rarer creature bore his shaft,\nl
That burning test of the godhead in our parts,\nl
A lightning from the heights on our abyss.\nl
All in her pointed to a nobler kind.\nl
Near to earth's wideness, intimate with heaven,\nl
Exalted and swift her young large-visioned spirit\nl
Voyaging through worlds of splendour and of calm\nl
Overflew the ways of Thought to unborn things.\nl
Ardent was her self-poised unstumbling will;\nl
Page 14

Her mind, a sea of white sincerity,\nl
Passionate in flow, had not one turbid wave.\nl
As in a mystic and dynamic dance\nl
A priestess of immaculate ecstasies\nl
Inspired and ruled from Truth's revealing vault\nl
Moves in some prophet cavern of the gods,\nl
A heart of silence in the hands of joy\nl
Inhabited with rich creative beats\nl
A body like a parable of dawn\nl
That seemed a niche for veiled divinity\nl
Or golden temple-door to things beyond.\nl
Immortal rhythms swayed in her time-born steps;\nl
Her look, her smile awoke celestial sense\nl
Even in earth-stuff, and their intense delight\nl
Poured a supernal beauty on men's lives.\nl
A wide self-giving was her native act;\nl
A magnanimity as of sea or sky\nl
Enveloped with its greatness all that came\nl
And gave a sense as of a greatened world:\nl
Her kindly care was a sweet temperate sun,\nl
Her high passion a blue heaven's equipoise.\nl
As might a soul fly like a hunted bird,\nl
Escaping with tired wings from a world of storms,\nl
And a quiet reach like a remembered breast,\nl
In a haven of safety and splendid soft repose\nl
One could drink life back in streams of honey-fire,\nl
Recover the lost habit of happiness,\nl
Feel her bright nature's glorious ambience,\nl
And preen joy in her warmth and colour's rule.\nl
A deep of compassion, a hushed sanctuary,\nl
Her inward help unbarred a gate in heaven;\nl
Love in her was wider than the universe,\nl
The whole world could take refuge in her single heart.\nl
The great unsatisfied godhead here could dwell:\nl
Vacant of the dwarf self's imprisoned air,\nl
Her mood could harbour his sublimer breath\nl
Page 15

Spiritual that can make all things divine.\nl
For even her gulfs were secrecies of light.\nl
At once she was the stillness and the word,\nl
A continent of self-diffusing peace,\nl
An ocean of untrembling virgin fire;\nl
The strength, the silence of the gods were hers.\nl
In her he found a vastness like his own,\nl
His high warm subtle ether he refound\nl
And moved in her as in his natural home.\nl
In her he met his own eternity.\nl

\spar Till then no mournful line had barred this ray.\nl
On the frail breast of this precarious earth,\nl
Since her orbed sight in its breath-fastened house,\nl
Opening in sympathy with happier stars\nl
Where life is not exposed to sorrowful change,\nl
Remembered beauty death-claimed lids ignore\nl
And wondered at this world of fragile forms\nl
Carried on canvas-strips of shimmering Time,\nl
The impunity of unborn Mights was hers.\nl
Although she leaned to bear the human load,\nl
Her walk kept still the measures of the gods.\nl
Earth's breath had failed to stain that brilliant glass:\nl
Unsmeared with the dust of our mortal atmosphere\nl
It still reflected heaven's spiritual joy.\nl
Almost they saw who lived within her light\nl
Her playmate in the sempiternal spheres\nl
Descended from its unattainable realms\nl
In her attracting advent's luminous wake,\nl
The white-fire dragon-bird of endless bliss\nl
Drifting with burning wings above her days:\nl
Heaven's tranquil shield guarded the missioned child.\nl
A glowing orbit was her early term,\nl
Years like gold raiment of the gods that pass;\nl
Her youth sat throned in calm felicity.\nl
But joy cannot endure until the end:\nl
Page 16

There is a darkness in terrestrial things\nl
That will not suffer long too glad a note.\nl
On her too closed the inescapable Hand:\nl
The armed Immortal bore the snare of Time.\nl
One dealt with her who meets the burdened great.\nl
Assigner of the ordeal and the path\nl
Who chooses in this holocaust of the soul\nl
Death, fall and sorrow as the spirit's goads,\nl
The dubious godhead with his torch of pain\nl
Lit up the chasm of the unfinished world\nl
And called her to fill with her vast self the abyss.\nl
August and pitiless in his calm outlook,\nl
Heightening the Eternal's dreadful strategy,\nl
He measured the difficulty with the might\nl
And dug more deep the gulf that all must cross.\nl
Assailing her divinest elements,\nl
He made her heart kin to the striving human heart\nl
And forced her strength to its appointed road.\nl
For this she had accepted mortal breath;\nl
To wrestle with the Shadow she had come\nl
And must confront the riddle of man's birth\nl
And life's brief struggle in dumb Matter's night.\nl
Whether to bear with Ignorance and death\nl
Or hew the ways of Immortality,\nl
To win or lose the godlike game for man,\nl
Was her soul's issue thrown with Destiny's dice.\nl
But not to submit and suffer was she born;\nl
To lead, to deliver was her glorious part.\nl
Here was no fabric of terrestrial make\nl
Fit for a day's use by busy careless Powers.\nl
An image fluttering on the screen of Fate,\nl
Half-animated for a passing show,\nl
Or a castaway on the ocean of Desire\nl
Flung to the eddies in a ruthless sport\nl
And tossed along the gulfs of Circumstance,\nl
A creature born to bend beneath the yoke,\nl
Page 17

A chattel and a plaything of Time's lords,\nl
Or one more pawn who comes destined to be pushed\nl
One slow move forward on a measureless board\nl
In the chess-play of the earth-soul with Doom,—\nl
Such is the human figure drawn by Time.\nl
A conscious frame was here, a self-born Force.\nl
In this enigma of the dusk of God,\nl
This slow and strange uneasy compromise\nl
Of limiting Nature with a limitless Soul,\nl
Where all must move between an ordered Chance\nl
And an uncaring blind Necessity,\nl
Too high the fire spiritual dare not blaze.\nl
If once it met the intense original Flame,\nl
An answering touch might shatter all measures made\nl
And earth sink down with the weight of the Infinite.\nl
A gaol is this immense material world:\nl
Across each road stands armed a stone-eyed Law,\nl
At every gate the huge dim sentinels pace.\nl
A grey tribunal of the Ignorance,\nl
An Inquisition of the priests of Night\nl
In judgment sit on the adventurer soul,\nl
And the dual tables and the Karmic norm\nl
Restrain the Titan in us and the God:\nl
Pain with its lash, joy with its silver bribe\nl
Guard the Wheel's circling immobility.\nl
A bond is put on the high-climbing mind,\nl
A seal on the too large wide-open heart;\nl
Death stays the journeying discoverer, Life.\nl
Thus is the throne of the Inconscient safe\nl
While the tardy coilings of the aeons pass\nl
And the Animal browses in the sacred fence\nl
And the gold Hawk can cross the skies no more.\nl
But one stood up and lit the limitless flame.\nl
Arraigned by the dark Power that hates all bliss\nl
In the dire court where life must pay for joy,\nl
Sentenced by the mechanic justicer\nl
Page 18

To the afflicting penalty of man's hopes,\nl
Her head she bowed not to the stark decree\nl
Baring her helpless heart to destiny's stroke.\nl
So bows and must the mind-born will in man\nl
Obedient to the statutes fixed of old,\nl
Admitting without appeal the nether gods.\nl
In her the superhuman cast its seed.\nl
Inapt to fold its mighty wings of dream\nl
Her spirit refused to hug the common soil,\nl
Or, finding all life's golden meanings robbed,\nl
Compound with earth, struck from the starry list,\nl
Or quench with black despair the God-given light.\nl
Accustomed to the eternal and the true,\nl
Her being conscious of its divine founts\nl
Asked not from mortal frailty pain's relief,\nl
Patched not with failure bargain or compromise.\nl
A work she had to do, a word to speak:\nl
Writing the unfinished story of her soul\nl
In thoughts and actions graved in Nature's book,\nl
She accepted not to close the luminous page,\nl
Cancel her commerce with eternity,\nl
Or set a signature of weak assent\nl
To the brute balance of the world's exchange.\nl
A force in her that toiled since earth was made,\nl
Accomplishing in life the great world-plan,\nl
Pursuing after death immortal aims,\nl
Repugned to admit frustration's barren role,\nl
Forfeit the meaning of her birth in Time,\nl
Obey the government of the casual fact\nl
Or yield her high destiny up to passing Chance.\nl
In her own self she found her high recourse;\nl
She matched with the iron law her sovereign right:\nl
Her single will opposed the cosmic rule.\nl
To stay the wheels of Doom this greatness rose.\nl
At the Unseen's knock upon her hidden gates\nl
Her strength made greater by the lightning's touch\nl
Page 19

Awoke from slumber in her heart's recess.\nl
It bore the stroke of That which kills and saves.\nl
Across the awful march no eye can see,\nl
Barring its dreadful route no will can change,\nl
She faced the engines of the universe;\nl
A heart stood in the way of the driving wheels:\nl
Its giant workings paused in front of a mind,\nl
Its stark conventions met the flame of a soul.\nl
A magic leverage suddenly is caught\nl
That moves the veiled Ineffable's timeless will:\nl
A prayer, a master act, a king idea\nl
Can link man's strength to a transcendent Force.\nl
Then miracle is made the common rule,\nl
One mighty deed can change the course of things;\nl
A lonely thought becomes omnipotent.\nl
All now seems Nature's massed machinery;\nl
An endless servitude to material rule\nl
And long determination's rigid chain,\nl
Her firm and changeless habits aping Law,\nl
Her empire of unconscious deft device\nl
Annul the claim of man's free human will.\nl
He too is a machine amid machines;\nl
A piston brain pumps out the shapes of thought,\nl
A beating heart cuts out emotion's modes;\nl
An insentient energy fabricates a soul.\nl
Or the figure of the world reveals the signs\nl
Of a tied Chance repeating her old steps\nl
In circles around Matter's binding-posts.\nl
A random series of inept events\nl
To which reason lends illusive sense, is here,\nl
Or the empiric Life's instinctive search,\nl
Or a vast ignorant mind's colossal work.\nl
But wisdom comes, and vision grows within:\nl
Then Nature's instrument crowns himself her king;\nl
He feels his witnessing self and conscious power;\nl
His soul steps back and sees the Light supreme.\nl
Page 20

A Godhead stands behind the brute machine.\nl
This truth broke in in a triumph of fire;\nl
A victory was won for God in man,\nl
The deity revealed its hidden face.\nl
The great World-Mother now in her arose:\nl
A living choice reversed fate's cold dead turn,\nl
Affirmed the spirit's tread on Circumstance,\nl
Pressed back the senseless dire revolving Wheel\nl
And stopped the mute march of Necessity.\nl
A flaming warrior from the eternal peaks\nl
Empowered to force the door denied and closed\nl
Smote from Death's visage its dumb absolute\nl
And burst the bounds of consciousness and Time.\nl

\sbigcap A world's desire compelled her mortal birth.\nl
One in the front of the immemorial quest,\nl
Protagonist of the mysterious play\nl
In which the Unknown pursues himself through forms\nl
And limits his eternity by the hours\nl
And the blind Void struggles to live and see,\nl
A thinker and toiler in the ideal's air,\nl
Brought down to earth's dumb need her radiant power.\nl
His was a spirit that stooped from larger spheres\nl
Into our province of ephemeral sight,\nl
A colonist from immortality.\nl
A pointing beam on earth's uncertain roads,\nl
His birth held up a symbol and a sign;\nl
His human self like a translucent cloak\nl
Covered the All-Wise who leads the unseeing world.\nl
Affiliated to cosmic Space and Time\nl
And paying here God's debt to earth and man\nl
A greater sonship was his divine right.\nl
Although consenting to mortal ignorance,\nl
His knowledge shared the Light ineffable.\nl
A strength of the original Permanence\nl
Entangled in the moment and its flow,\nl
He kept the vision of the Vasts behind:\nl
A power was in him from the Unknowable.\nl
An archivist of the symbols of the Beyond,\nl
A treasurer of superhuman dreams,\nl
He bore the stamp of mighty memories\nl
And shed their grandiose ray on human life.\nl
His days were a long growth to the Supreme.\nl
A skyward being nourishing its roots\nl
Page 22

On sustenance from occult spiritual founts\nl
Climbed through white rays to meet an unseen Sun.\nl
His soul lived as eternity's delegate,\nl
His mind was like a fire assailing heaven,\nl
His will a hunter in the trails of light.\nl
An ocean impulse lifted every breath;\nl
Each action left the footprints of a god,\nl
Each moment was a beat of puissant wings.\nl
The little plot of our mortality\nl
Touched by this tenant from the heights became\nl
A playground of the living Infinite.\nl
This bodily appearance is not all;\nl
The form deceives, the person is a mask;\nl
Hid deep in man celestial powers can dwell.\nl
His fragile ship conveys through the sea of years\nl
An incognito of the Imperishable.\nl
A spirit that is a flame of God abides,\nl
A fiery portion of the Wonderful,\nl
Artist of his own beauty and delight,\nl
Immortal in our mortal poverty.\nl
This sculptor of the forms of the Infinite,\nl
This screened unrecognised Inhabitant,\nl
Initiate of his own veiled mysteries,\nl
Hides in a small dumb seed his cosmic thought.\nl
In the mute strength of the occult Idea\nl
Determining predestined shape and act,\nl
Passenger from life to life, from scale to scale,\nl
Changing his imaged self from form to form,\nl
He regards the icon growing by his gaze\nl
And in the worm foresees the coming god.\nl
At last the traveller in the paths of Time\nl
Arrives on the frontiers of eternity.\nl
In the transient symbol of humanity draped,\nl
He feels his substance of undying self\nl
And loses his kinship to mortality.\nl
A beam of the Eternal smites his heart,\nl
Page 23

His thought stretches into infinitude;\nl
All in him turns to spirit vastnesses.\nl
His soul breaks out to join the Oversoul,\nl
His life is oceaned by that superlife.\nl
He has drunk from the breasts of the Mother of the worlds;\nl
A topless Supernature fills his frame:\nl
She adopts his spirit's everlasting ground\nl
As the security of her changing world\nl
And shapes the figure of her unborn mights.\nl
Immortally she conceives herself in him,\nl
In the creature the unveiled Creatrix works:\nl
Her face is seen through his face, her eyes through his eyes;\nl
Her being is his through a vast identity.\nl
Then is revealed in man the overt Divine.\nl
A static Oneness and dynamic Power\nl
Descend in him, the integral Godhead's seals;\nl
His soul and body take that splendid stamp.\nl
A long dim preparation is man's life,\nl
A circle of toil and hope and war and peace\nl
Tracked out by Life on Matter's obscure ground.\nl
In his climb to a peak no feet have ever trod,\nl
He seeks through a penumbra shot with flame\nl
A veiled reality half-known, ever missed,\nl
A search for something or someone never found,\nl
Cult of an ideal never made real here,\nl
An endless spiral of ascent and fall\nl
Until at last is reached the giant point\nl
Through which his Glory shines for whom we were made\nl
And we break into the infinity of God.\nl
Across our nature's border line we escape\nl
Into Supernature's arc of living light.\nl
This now was witnessed in that son of Force;\nl
In him that high transition laid its base.\nl
Original and supernal Immanence\nl
Of which all Nature's process is the art,\nl
The cosmic Worker set his secret hand\nl
Page 24

To turn this frail mud-engine to heaven-use.\nl
A Presence wrought behind the ambiguous screen:\nl
It beat his soil to bear a Titan's weight,\nl
Refining half-hewn blocks of natural strength\nl
It built his soul into a statued god.\nl
The Craftsman of the magic stuff of self\nl
Who labours at his high and difficult plan\nl
In the wide workshop of the wonderful world,\nl
Modelled in inward Time his rhythmic parts.\nl
Then came the abrupt transcendent miracle:\nl
The masked immaculate Grandeur could outline,\nl
At travail in the occult womb of life,\nl
His dreamed magnificence of things to be.\nl
A crown of the architecture of the worlds,\nl
A mystery of married Earth and Heaven\nl
Annexed divinity to the mortal scheme.\nl
A Seer was born, a shining Guest of Time.\nl
For him mind's limiting firmament ceased above.\nl
In the griffin forefront of the Night and Day\nl
A gap was rent in the all-concealing vault;\nl
The conscious ends of being went rolling back:\nl
The landmarks of the little person fell,\nl
The island ego joined its continent.\nl
Overpassed was this world of rigid limiting forms:\nl
Life's barriers opened into the Unknown.\nl
Abolished were conception's covenants\nl
And, striking off subjection's rigorous clause,\nl
Annulled the soul's treaty with Nature's nescience.\nl
All the grey inhibitions were torn off\nl
And broken the intellect's hard and lustrous lid;\nl
Truth unpartitioned found immense sky-room;\nl
An empyrean vision saw and knew;\nl
The bounded mind became a boundless light,\nl
The finite self mated with infinity.\nl
His march now soared into an eagle's flight.\nl
Out of apprenticeship to Ignorance\nl
Page 25

Wisdom upraised him to her master craft\nl
And made him an archmason of the soul,\nl
A builder of the Immortal's secret house,\nl
An aspirant to supernal Timelessness:\nl
Freedom and empire called to him from on high;\nl
Above mind's twilight and life's star-led night\nl
There gleamed the dawn of a spiritual day.\nl

\spar As so he grew into his larger self,\nl
Humanity framed his movements less and less;\nl
A greater being saw a greater world.\nl
A fearless will for knowledge dared to erase\nl
The lines of safety Reason draws that bar\nl
Mind's soar, soul's dive into the Infinite.\nl
Even his first steps broke our small earth-bounds\nl
And loitered in a vaster freer air.\nl
In hands sustained by a transfiguring Might\nl
He caught up lightly like a giant's bow\nl
Left slumbering in a sealed and secret cave\nl
The powers that sleep unused in man within.\nl
He made of miracle a normal act\nl
And turned to a common part of divine works,\nl
Magnificently natural at this height,\nl
Efforts that would shatter the strength of mortal hearts,\nl
Pursued in a royalty of mighty ease\nl
Aims too sublime for Nature's daily will:\nl
The gifts of the spirit crowding came to him;\nl
They were his life's pattern and his privilege.\nl
A pure perception lent its lucent joy:\nl
Its intimate vision waited not to think;\nl
It enveloped all Nature in a single glance,\nl
It looked into the very self of things;\nl
Deceived no more by form he saw the soul.\nl
In beings it knew what lurked to them unknown;\nl
It seized the idea in mind, the wish in the heart;\nl
It plucked out from grey folds of secrecy\nl
Page 26

The motives which from their own sight men hide.\nl
He felt the beating life in other men\nl
Invade him with their happiness and their grief;\nl
Their love, their anger, their unspoken hopes\nl
Entered in currents or in pouring waves\nl
Into the immobile ocean of his calm.\nl
He heard the inspired sound of his own thoughts\nl
Re-echoed in the vault of other minds;\nl
The world's thought-streams travelled into his ken;\nl
His inner self grew near to others' selves\nl
And bore a kinship's weight, a common tie,\nl
Yet stood untouched, king of itself, alone.\nl
A magical accord quickened and attuned\nl
To ethereal symphonies the old earthy strings;\nl
It raised the servitors of mind and life\nl
To be happy partners in the soul's response,\nl
Tissue and nerve were turned to sensitive chords,\nl
Records of lustre and ecstasy; it made\nl
The body's means the spirit's acolytes.\nl
A heavenlier function with a finer mode\nl
Lit with its grace man's outward earthliness;\nl
The soul's experience of its deeper sheaths\nl
No more slept drugged by Matter's dominance.\nl
In the dead wall closing us from wider self,\nl
Into a secrecy of apparent sleep,\nl
The mystic tract beyond our waking thoughts,\nl
A door parted, built in by Matter's force,\nl
Releasing things unseized by earthly sense:\nl
A world unseen, unknown by outward mind\nl
Appeared in the silent spaces of the soul.\nl
He sat in secret chambers looking out\nl
Into the luminous countries of the unborn\nl
Where all things dreamed by the mind are seen and true\nl
And all that the life longs for is drawn close.\nl
He saw the Perfect in their starry homes\nl
Wearing the glory of a deathless form,\nl
Page 27

Lain in the arms of the Eternal's peace,\nl
Rapt in the heart-beats of God-ecstasy.\nl
He lived in the mystic space where thought is born\nl
And will is nursed by an ethereal Power\nl
And fed on the white milk of the Eternal's strengths\nl
Till it grows into the likeness of a god.\nl
In the Witness's occult rooms with mind-built walls\nl
On hidden interiors, lurking passages\nl
Opened the windows of the inner sight.\nl
He owned the house of undivided Time.\nl
Lifting the heavy curtain of the flesh\nl
He stood upon a threshold serpent-watched,\nl
And peered into gleaming endless corridors,\nl
Silent and listening in the silent heart\nl
For the coming of the new and the unknown.\nl
He gazed across the empty stillnesses\nl
And heard the footsteps of the undreamed Idea\nl
In the far avenues of the Beyond.\nl
He heard the secret Voice, the Word that knows,\nl
And saw the secret face that is our own.\nl
The inner planes uncovered their crystal doors;\nl
Strange powers and influences touched his life.\nl
A vision came of higher realms than ours,\nl
A consciousness of brighter fields and skies,\nl
Of beings less circumscribed than brief-lived men\nl
And subtler bodies than these passing frames,\nl
Objects too fine for our material grasp,\nl
Acts vibrant with a superhuman light\nl
And movements pushed by a superconscient force,\nl
And joys that never flowed through mortal limbs,\nl
And lovelier scenes than earth's and happier lives.\nl
A consciousness of beauty and of bliss,\nl
A knowledge which became what it perceived,\nl
Replaced the separated sense and heart\nl
And drew all Nature into its embrace.\nl
The mind leaned out to meet the hidden worlds:\nl
Page 28

Air glowed and teemed with marvellous shapes and hues,\nl
In the nostrils quivered celestial fragrances,\nl
On the tongue lingered the honey of paradise.\nl
A channel of universal harmony,\nl
Hearing was a stream of magic audience,\nl
A bed for occult sounds earth cannot hear.\nl
Out of a covert tract of slumber self\nl
The voice came of a truth submerged, unknown\nl
That flows beneath the cosmic surfaces,\nl
Only mid an omniscient silence heard,\nl
Held by intuitive heart and secret sense.\nl
It caught the burden of secrecies sealed and dumb,\nl
It voiced the unfulfilled demand of earth\nl
And the song of promise of unrealised heavens\nl
And all that hides in an omnipotent Sleep.\nl
In the unceasing drama carried by Time\nl
On its long listening flood that bears the world's\nl
Insoluble doubt on a pilgrimage without goal,\nl
A laughter of sleepless pleasure foamed and spumed\nl
And murmurings of desire that cannot die:\nl
A cry came of the world's delight to be,\nl
The grandeur and greatness of its will to live,\nl
Recall of the soul's adventure into space,\nl
A traveller through the magic centuries\nl
And being's labour in Matter's universe,\nl
Its search for the mystic meaning of its birth\nl
And joy of high spiritual response,\nl
Its throb of satisfaction and content\nl
In all the sweetness of the gifts of life,\nl
Its large breath and pulse and thrill of hope and fear,\nl
Its taste of pangs and tears and ecstasy,\nl
Its rapture's poignant beat of sudden bliss,\nl
The sob of its passion and unending pain.\nl
The murmur and whisper of the unheard sounds\nl
Which crowd around our hearts but find no window\nl
To enter, swelled into a canticle\nl
Page 29

Of all that suffers to be still unknown\nl
And all that labours vainly to be born\nl
And all the sweetness none will ever taste\nl
And all the beauty that will never be.\nl
Inaudible to our deaf mortal ears\nl
The wide world-rhythms wove their stupendous chant\nl
To which life strives to fit our rhyme-beats here,\nl
Melting our limits in the illimitable,\nl
Tuning the finite to infinity.\nl
A low muttering rose from the subconscient caves,\nl
The stammer of the primal ignorance;\nl
Answer to that inarticulate questioning,\nl
There stooped with lightning neck and thunder's wings\nl
A radiant hymn to the Inexpressible\nl
And the anthem of the superconscient light.\nl
All was revealed there none can here express;\nl
Vision and dream were fables spoken by truth\nl
Or symbols more veridical than fact,\nl
Or were truths enforced by supernatural seals.\nl
Immortal eyes approached and looked in his,\nl
And beings of many kingdoms neared and spoke:\nl
The ever-living whom we name as dead\nl
Could leave their glory beyond death and birth\nl
To utter the wisdom which exceeds all phrase:\nl
The kings of evil and the kings of good,\nl
Appellants at the reason's judgment seat,\nl
Proclaimed the gospel of their opposites,\nl
And all believed themselves spokesmen of God:\nl
The gods of light and titans of the dark\nl
Battled for his soul as for a costly prize.\nl
In every hour loosed from the quiver of Time\nl
There rose a song of new discovery,\nl
A bow-twang's hum of young experiment.\nl
Each day was a spiritual romance,\nl
As if he was born into a bright new world;\nl
Adventure leaped an unexpected friend,\nl
Page 30

And danger brought a keen sweet tang of joy;\nl
Each happening was a deep experience.\nl
There were high encounters, epic colloquies,\nl
And counsels came couched in celestial speech,\nl
And honeyed pleadings breathed from occult lips\nl
To help the heart to yield to rapture's call,\nl
And sweet temptations stole from beauty's realms\nl
And sudden ecstasies from a world of bliss.\nl
It was a region of wonder and delight.\nl
All now his bright clairaudience could receive;\nl
A contact thrilled of mighty unknown things.\nl
Awakened to new unearthly closenesses,\nl
The touch replied to subtle infinities,\nl
And with a silver cry of opening gates\nl
Sight's lightnings leaped into the invisible.\nl
Ever his consciousness and vision grew;\nl
They took an ampler sweep, a loftier flight;\nl
He passed the border marked for Matter's rule\nl
And passed the zone where thought replaces life.\nl
Out of this world of signs suddenly he came\nl
Into a silent self where world was not\nl
And looked beyond into a nameless vast.\nl
These symbol figures lost their right to live,\nl
All tokens dropped our sense can recognise;\nl
There the heart beat no more at body's touch,\nl
There the eyes gazed no more on beauty's shape.\nl
In rare and lucent intervals of hush\nl
Into a signless region he could soar\nl
Packed with the deep contents of formlessness\nl
Where world was into a single being rapt\nl
And all was known by the light of identity\nl
And Spirit was its own self-evidence.\nl
The Supreme's gaze looked out through human eyes\nl
And saw all things and creatures as itself\nl
And knew all thought and word as its own voice.\nl
There unity is too close for search and clasp\nl
Page 31

And love is a yearning of the One for the One,\nl
And beauty is a sweet difference of the Same\nl
And oneness is the soul of multitude.\nl
There all the truths unite in a single Truth,\nl
And all ideas rejoin Reality.\nl
There knowing herself by her own termless self,\nl
Wisdom supernal, wordless, absolute\nl
Sat uncompanioned in the eternal Calm,\nl
All-seeing, motionless, sovereign and alone.\nl
There knowledge needs not words to embody Idea;\nl
Idea, seeking a house in boundlessness,\nl
Weary of its homeless immortality,\nl
Asks not in thought's carved brilliant cell to rest\nl
Whose single window's clipped outlook on things\nl
Sees only a little arc of God's vast sky.\nl
The boundless with the boundless there consorts;\nl
While there, one can be wider than the world;\nl
While there, one is one's own infinity.\nl
His centre was no more in earthly mind;\nl
A power of seeing silence filled his limbs:\nl
Caught by a voiceless white epiphany\nl
Into a vision that surpasses forms,\nl
Into a living that surpasses life,\nl
He neared the still consciousness sustaining all.\nl
The voice that only by speech can move the mind\nl
Became a silent knowledge in the soul;\nl
The strength that only in action feels its truth\nl
Was lodged now in a mute omnipotent peace.\nl
A leisure in the labour of the worlds,\nl
A pause in the joy and anguish of the search\nl
Restored the stress of Nature to God's calm.\nl
A vast unanimity ended life's debate.\nl
The war of thoughts that fathers the universe,\nl
The clash of forces struggling to prevail\nl
In the tremendous shock that lights a star\nl
As in the building of a grain of dust,\nl
Page 32

The grooves that turn their dumb ellipse in space\nl
Ploughed by the seeking of the world's desire,\nl
The long regurgitations of Time's flood,\nl
The torment edging the dire force of lust\nl
That wakes kinetic in earth's dullard slime\nl
And carves a personality out of mud,\nl
The sorrow by which Nature's hunger is fed,\nl
The oestrus which creates with fire of pain,\nl
The fate that punishes virtue with defeat,\nl
The tragedy that destroys long happiness,\nl
The weeping of Love, the quarrel of the Gods,\nl
Ceased in a truth which lives in its own light.\nl
His soul stood free, a witness and a king.\nl
Absorbed no more in the moment-ridden flux\nl
Where mind incessantly drifts as on a raft\nl
Hurried from phenomenon to phenomenon,\nl
He abode at rest in indivisible Time.\nl
As if a story long written but acted now,\nl
In his present he held his future and his past,\nl
Felt in the seconds the uncounted years\nl
And saw the hours like dots upon a page.\nl
An aspect of the unknown Reality\nl
Altered the meaning of the cosmic scene.\nl
This huge material universe became\nl
A small result of a stupendous force:\nl
Overtaking the moment the eternal Ray\nl
Illumined That which never yet was made.\nl
Thought lay down in a mighty voicelessness;\nl
The toiling Thinker widened and grew still,\nl
Wisdom transcendent touched his quivering heart:\nl
His soul could sail beyond thought's luminous bar;\nl
Mind screened no more the shoreless infinite.\nl
Across a void retreating sky he glimpsed\nl
Through a last glimmer and drift of vanishing stars\nl
The superconscient realms of motionless Peace\nl
Where judgment ceases and the word is mute\nl
Page 33

And the Unconceived lies pathless and alone.\nl
There came not form or any mounting voice;\nl
There only were Silence and the Absolute.\nl
Out of that stillness mind new-born arose\nl
And woke to truths once inexpressible,\nl
And forms appeared, dumbly significant,\nl
A seeing thought, a self-revealing voice.\nl
He knew the source from which his spirit came:\nl
Movement was married to the immobile Vast;\nl
He plunged his roots into the Infinite,\nl
He based his life upon eternity.\nl

\spar Only awhile at first these heavenlier states,\nl
These large wide-poised upliftings could endure.\nl
The high and luminous tension breaks too soon,\nl
The body's stone stillness and the life's hushed trance,\nl
The breathless might and calm of silent mind;\nl
Or slowly they fail as sets a golden day.\nl
The restless nether members tire of peace;\nl
A nostalgia of old little works and joys,\nl
A need to call back small familiar selves,\nl
To tread the accustomed and inferior way,\nl
The need to rest in a natural pose of fall,\nl
As a child who learns to walk can walk not long,\nl
Replace the titan will for ever to climb,\nl
On the heart's altar dim the sacred fire.\nl
An old pull of subconscious cords renews;\nl
It draws the unwilling spirit from the heights,\nl
Or a dull gravitation drags us down\nl
To the blind driven inertia of our base.\nl
This too the supreme Diplomat can use,\nl
He makes our fall a means for greater rise.\nl
For into ignorant Nature's gusty field,\nl
Into the half-ordered chaos of mortal life\nl
The formless Power, the Self of eternal light\nl
Follow in the shadow of the spirit's descent;\nl
Page 34

The twin duality for ever one\nl
Chooses its home mid the tumults of the sense.\nl
He comes unseen into our darker parts\nl
And, curtained by the darkness, does his work,\nl
A subtle and all-knowing guest and guide,\nl
Till they too feel the need and will to change.\nl
All here must learn to obey a higher law,\nl
Our body's cells must hold the Immortal's flame.\nl
Else would the spirit reach alone its source\nl
Leaving a half-saved world to its dubious fate.\nl
Nature would ever labour unredeemed;\nl
Our earth would ever spin unhelped in Space,\nl
And this immense creation's purpose fail\nl
Till at last the frustrate universe sank undone.\nl
Even his godlike strength to rise must fall:\nl
His greater consciousness withdrew behind;\nl
Dim and eclipsed, his human outside strove\nl
To feel again the old sublimities,\nl
Bring the high saving touch, the ethereal flame,\nl
Call back to its dire need the divine Force.\nl
Always the power poured back like sudden rain,\nl
Or slowly in his breast a presence grew;\nl
It clambered back to some remembered height\nl
Or soared above the peak from which it fell.\nl
Each time he rose there was a larger poise,\nl
A dwelling on a higher spirit plane;\nl
The Light remained in him a longer space.\nl
In this oscillation between earth and heaven,\nl
In this ineffable communion's climb\nl
There grew in him as grows a waxing moon\nl
The glory of the integer of his soul.\nl
A union of the Real with the unique,\nl
A gaze of the Alone from every face,\nl
The presence of the Eternal in the hours\nl
Widening the mortal mind's half-look on things,\nl
Bridging the gap between man's force and Fate\nl
Page 35

Made whole the fragment-being we are here.\nl
At last was won a firm spiritual poise,\nl
A constant lodging in the Eternal's realm,\nl
A safety in the Silence and the Ray,\nl
A settlement in the Immutable.\nl
His heights of being lived in the still Self;\nl
His mind could rest on a supernal ground\nl
And look down on the magic and the play\nl
Where the God-child lies on the lap of Night and Dawn\nl
And the Everlasting puts on Time's disguise.\nl
To the still heights and to the troubled depths\nl
His equal spirit gave its vast assent:\nl
A poised serenity of tranquil strength,\nl
A wide unshaken look on Time's unrest\nl
Faced all experience with unaltered peace.\nl
Indifferent to the sorrow and delight,\nl
Untempted by the marvel and the call,\nl
Immobile it beheld the flux of things,\nl
Calm and apart supported all that is:\nl
His spirit's stillness helped the toiling world.\nl
Inspired by silence and the closed eyes' sight\nl
His force could work with a new luminous art\nl
On the crude material from which all is made\nl
And the refusal of Inertia's mass\nl
And the grey front of the world's Ignorance\nl
And nescient Matter and the huge error of life.\nl
As a sculptor chisels a deity out of stone\nl
He slowly chipped off the dark envelope,\nl
Line of defence of Nature's ignorance,\nl
The illusion and mystery of the Inconscient\nl
In whose black pall the Eternal wraps his head\nl
That he may act unknown in cosmic Time.\nl
A splendour of self-creation from the peaks,\nl
A transfiguration in the mystic depths,\nl
A happier cosmic working could begin\nl
And fashion the world-shape in him anew,\nl
Page 36

God found in Nature, Nature fulfilled in God.\nl
Already in him was seen that task of Power:\nl
Life made its home on the high tops of self;\nl
His soul, mind, heart became a single sun;\nl
Only life's lower reaches remained dim.\nl
But there too, in the uncertain shadow of life,\nl
There was a labour and a fiery breath;\nl
The ambiguous cowled celestial puissance worked\nl
Watched by the inner Witness's moveless peace.\nl
Even on the struggling Nature left below\nl
Strong periods of illumination came:\nl
Lightnings of glory after glory burned,\nl
Experience was a tale of blaze and fire,\nl
Air rippled round the argosies of the Gods,\nl
Strange riches sailed to him from the Unseen;\nl
Splendours of insight filled the blank of thought,\nl
Knowledge spoke to the inconscient stillnesses,\nl
Rivers poured down of bliss and luminous force,\nl
Visits of beauty, storm-sweeps of delight\nl
Rained from the all-powerful Mystery above.\nl
Thence stooped the eagles of Omniscience.\nl
A dense veil was rent, a mighty whisper heard;\nl
Repeated in the privacy of his soul,\nl
A wisdom-cry from rapt transcendences\nl
Sang on the mountains of an unseen world;\nl
The voices that an inner listening hears\nl
Conveyed to him their prophet utterances,\nl
And flame-wrapped outbursts of the immortal Word\nl
And flashes of an occult revealing Light\nl
Approached him from the unreachable Secrecy.\nl
An inspired Knowledge sat enthroned within\nl
Whose seconds illumined more than reason's years:\nl
An ictus of revealing lustre fell\nl
As if a pointing accent upon Truth,\nl
And like a sky-flare showing all the ground\nl
A swift intuitive discernment shone.\nl
Page 37

One glance could separate the true and false,\nl
Or raise its rapid torch-fire in the dark\nl
To check the claimants crowding through mind's gates\nl
Covered by the forged signatures of the gods,\nl
Detect the magic bride in her disguise\nl
Or scan the apparent face of thought and life.\nl

\spar Oft inspiration with her lightning feet,\nl
A sudden messenger from the all-seeing tops,\nl
Traversed the soundless corridors of his mind\nl
Bringing her rhythmic sense of hidden things.\nl
A music spoke transcending mortal speech.\nl
As if from a golden phial of the All-Bliss,\nl
A joy of light, a joy of sudden sight,\nl
A rapture of the thrilled undying Word\nl
Poured into his heart as into an empty cup,\nl
A repetition of God's first delight\nl
Creating in a young and virgin Time.\nl
In a brief moment caught, a little space,\nl
All-Knowledge packed into great wordless thoughts\nl
Lodged in the expectant stillness of his depths\nl
A crystal of the ultimate Absolute,\nl
A portion of the inexpressible Truth\nl
Revealed by silence to the silent soul.\nl
The intense creatrix in his stillness wrought;\nl
Her power fallen speechless grew more intimate;\nl
She looked upon the seen and the unforeseen,\nl
Unguessed domains she made her native field.\nl
All-vision gathered into a single ray,\nl
As when the eyes stare at an invisible point\nl
Till through the intensity of one luminous spot\nl
An apocalypse of a world of images\nl
Enters into the kingdom of the seer.\nl
A great nude arm of splendour suddenly rose;\nl
It rent the gauze opaque of Nescience:\nl
Her lifted finger's keen unthinkable tip\nl
Page 38

Bared with a stab of flame the closed Beyond.\nl
An eye awake in voiceless heights of trance,\nl
A mind plucking at the unimaginable,\nl
Overleaping with a sole and perilous bound\nl
The high black wall hiding superconscience,\nl
She broke in with inspired speech for scythe\nl
And plundered the Unknowable's vast estate.\nl
A gleaner of infinitesimal grains of Truth,\nl
A sheaf-binder of infinite experience,\nl
She pierced the guarded mysteries of World-Force\nl
And her magic methods wrapped in a thousand veils;\nl
Or she gathered the lost secrets dropped by Time\nl
In the dust and crannies of his mounting route\nl
Mid old forsaken dreams of hastening Mind\nl
And buried remnants of forgotten space.\nl
A traveller between summit and abyss,\nl
She joined the distant ends, the viewless deeps,\nl
Or streaked along the roads of Heaven and Hell\nl
Pursuing all knowledge like a questing hound.\nl
A reporter and scribe of hidden wisdom talk,\nl
Her shining minutes of celestial speech,\nl
Passed through the masked office of the occult mind,\nl
Transmitting gave to prophet and to seer\nl
The inspired body of the mystic Truth.\nl
A recorder of the inquiry of the gods,\nl
Spokesman of the silent seeings of the Supreme,\nl
She brought immortal words to mortal men.\nl
Above the reason's brilliant slender curve,\nl
Released like radiant air dimming a moon,\nl
Broad spaces of a vision without line\nl
Or limit swam into his spirit's ken.\nl
Oceans of being met his voyaging soul\nl
Calling to infinite discovery;\nl
Timeless domains of joy and absolute power\nl
Stretched out surrounded by the eternal hush;\nl
The ways that lead to endless happiness\nl
Page 39

Ran like dream-smiles through meditating vasts:\nl
Disclosed stood up in a gold moment's blaze\nl
White sun-steppes in the pathless Infinite.\nl
Along a naked curve in bourneless Self\nl
The points that run through the closed heart of things\nl
Shadowed the indeterminable line\nl
That carries the Everlasting through the years.\nl
The magician order of the cosmic Mind\nl
Coercing the freedom of infinity\nl
With the stark array of Nature's symbol facts\nl
And life's incessant signals of event,\nl
Transmuted chance recurrences into laws,\nl
A chaos of signs into a universe.\nl
Out of the rich wonders and the intricate whorls\nl
Of the spirit's dance with Matter as its mask\nl
The balance of the world's design grew clear,\nl
Its symmetry of self-arranged effects\nl
Managed in the deep perspectives of the soul,\nl
And the realism of its illusive art,\nl
Its logic of infinite intelligence,\nl
Its magic of a changing eternity.\nl
A glimpse was caught of things for ever unknown:\nl
The letters stood out of the unmoving Word:\nl
In the immutable nameless Origin\nl
Was seen emerging as from fathomless seas\nl
The trail of the Ideas that made the world,\nl
And, sown in the black earth of Nature's trance,\nl
The seed of the Spirit's blind and huge desire\nl
From which the tree of cosmos was conceived\nl
And spread its magic arms through a dream of space.\nl
Immense realities took on a shape:\nl
There looked out from the shadow of the Unknown\nl
The bodiless Namelessness that saw God born\nl
And tries to gain from the mortal's mind and soul\nl
A deathless body and a divine name.\nl
The immobile lips, the great surreal wings,\nl
Page 40

The visage masked by superconscient Sleep,\nl
The eyes with their closed lids that see all things,\nl
Appeared of the Architect who builds in trance.\nl
The original Desire born in the Void\nl
Peered out; he saw the hope that never sleeps,\nl
The feet that run behind a fleeting fate,\nl
The ineffable meaning of the endless dream.\nl
Hardly for a moment glimpsed viewless to Mind,\nl
As if a torch held by a power of God,\nl
The radiant world of the everlasting Truth\nl
Glimmered like a faint star bordering the night\nl
Above the golden Overmind's shimmering ridge.\nl
Even were caught as through a cunning veil\nl
The smile of love that sanctions the long game,\nl
The calm indulgence and maternal breasts\nl
Of Wisdom suckling the child-laughter of Chance,\nl
Silence, the nurse of the Almighty's power,\nl
The omniscient hush, womb of the immortal Word,\nl
And of the Timeless the still brooding face,\nl
And the creative eye of Eternity.\nl
The inspiring goddess entered a mortal's breast,\nl
Made there her study of divining thought\nl
And sanctuary of prophetic speech\nl
And sat upon the tripod seat of mind:\nl
All was made wide above, all lit below.\nl
In darkness' core she dug out wells of light,\nl
On the undiscovered depths imposed a form,\nl
Lent a vibrant cry to the unuttered vasts,\nl
And through great shoreless, voiceless, starless breadths\nl
Bore earthward fragments of revealing thought\nl
Hewn from the silence of the Ineffable.\nl
A Voice in the heart uttered the unspoken Name,\nl
A dream of seeking Thought wandering through Space\nl
Entered the invisible and forbidden house:\nl
The treasure was found of a supernal Day.\nl
In the deep subconscient glowed her jewel-lamp;\nl
Page 41

Lifted, it showed the riches of the Cave\nl
Where, by the miser traffickers of sense\nl
Unused, guarded beneath Night's dragon paws,\nl
In folds of velvet darkness draped they sleep\nl
Whose priceless value could have saved the world.\nl
A darkness carrying morning in its breast\nl
Looked for the eternal wide returning gleam,\nl
Waiting the advent of a larger ray\nl
And rescue of the lost herds of the Sun.\nl
In a splendid extravagance of the waste of God\nl
Dropped carelessly in creation's spendthrift work,\nl
Left in the chantiers of the bottomless world\nl
And stolen by the robbers of the Deep,\nl
The golden shekels of the Eternal lie,\nl
Hoarded from touch and view and thought's desire,\nl
Locked in blind antres of the ignorant flood,\nl
Lest men should find them and be even as Gods.\nl
A vision lightened on the viewless heights,\nl
A wisdom illumined from the voiceless depths:\nl
A deeper interpretation greatened Truth,\nl
A grand reversal of the Night and Day;\nl
All the world's values changed heightening life's aim;\nl
A wiser word, a larger thought came in\nl
Than what the slow labour of human mind can bring,\nl
A secret sense awoke that could perceive\nl
A Presence and a Greatness everywhere.\nl
The universe was not now this senseless whirl\nl
Borne round inert on an immense machine;\nl
It cast away its grandiose lifeless front,\nl
A mechanism no more or work of Chance,\nl
But a living movement of the body of God.\nl
A spirit hid in forces and in forms\nl
Was the spectator of the mobile scene:\nl
The beauty and the ceaseless miracle\nl
Let in a glow of the Unmanifest:\nl
The formless Everlasting moved in it\nl
Page 42

Seeking its own perfect form in souls and things.\nl
Life kept no more a dull and meaningless shape.\nl
In the struggle and upheaval of the world\nl
He saw the labour of a godhead's birth.\nl
A secret knowledge masked as Ignorance;\nl
Fate covered with an unseen necessity\nl
The game of chance of an omnipotent Will.\nl
A glory and a rapture and a charm,\nl
The All-Blissful sat unknown within the heart;\nl
Earth's pains were the ransom of its prisoned delight.\nl
A glad communion tinged the passing hours;\nl
The days were travellers on a destined road,\nl
The nights companions of his musing spirit.\nl
A heavenly impetus quickened all his breast;\nl
The trudge of Time changed to a splendid march;\nl
The divine Dwarf towered to unconquered worlds,\nl
Earth grew too narrow for his victory.\nl
Once only registering the heavy tread\nl
Of a blind Power on human littleness,\nl
Life now became a sure approach to God,\nl
Existence a divine experiment\nl
And cosmos the soul's opportunity.\nl
The world was a conception and a birth\nl
Of Spirit in Matter into living forms,\nl
And Nature bore the Immortal in her womb,\nl
That she might climb through him to eternal life.\nl
His being lay down in bright immobile peace\nl
And bathed in wells of pure spiritual light;\nl
It wandered in wide fields of wisdom-self\nl
Lit by the rays of an everlasting sun.\nl
Even his body's subtle self within\nl
Could raise the earthly parts towards higher things\nl
And feel on it the breath of heavenlier air.\nl
Already it journeyed towards divinity:\nl
Upbuoyed upon winged winds of rapid joy,\nl
Upheld to a Light it could not always hold,\nl
Page 43

It left mind's distance from the Truth supreme\nl
And lost life's incapacity for bliss.\nl
All now suppressed in us began to emerge.\nl

\spar Thus came his soul's release from Ignorance,\nl
His mind and body's first spiritual change.\nl
A wide God-knowledge poured down from above,\nl
A new world-knowledge broadened from within:\nl
His daily thoughts looked up to the True and One,\nl
His commonest doings welled from an inner Light.\nl
Awakened to the lines that Nature hides,\nl
Attuned to her movements that exceed our ken,\nl
He grew one with a covert universe.\nl
His grasp surprised her mightiest energies' springs;\nl
He spoke with the unknown Guardians of the worlds,\nl
Forms he descried our mortal eyes see not.\nl
His wide eyes bodied viewless entities,\nl
He saw the cosmic forces at their work\nl
And felt the occult impulse behind man's will.\nl
Time's secrets were to him an oft-read book;\nl
The records of the future and the past\nl
Outlined their excerpts on the etheric page.\nl
One and harmonious by the Maker's skill,\nl
The human in him paced with the divine;\nl
His acts betrayed not the interior flame.\nl
This forged the greatness of his front to earth.\nl
A genius heightened in his body's cells\nl
That knew the meaning of his fate-hedged works\nl
Akin to the march of unaccomplished Powers\nl
Beyond life's arc in spirit's immensities.\nl
Apart he lived in his mind's solitude,\nl
A demigod shaping the lives of men:\nl
One soul's ambition lifted up the race;\nl
A Power worked, but none knew whence it came.\nl
The universal strengths were linked with his;\nl
Filling earth's smallness with their boundless breadths,\nl
Page 44

He drew the energies that transmute an age.\nl
Immeasurable by the common look,\nl
He made great dreams a mould for coming things\nl
And cast his deeds like bronze to front the years.\nl
His walk through Time outstripped the human stride.\nl
Lonely his days and splendid like the sun's.\nl

\sbigcap On a height he stood that looked towards greater heights.\nl
Our early approaches to the Infinite\nl
Are sunrise splendours on a marvellous verge\nl
While lingers yet unseen the glorious sun.\nl
What now we see is a shadow of what must come.\nl
The earth's uplook to a remote Unknown\nl
Is a preface only of the epic climb\nl
Of human soul from its flat earthly state\nl
To the discovery of a greater self\nl
And the far gleam of an eternal Light.\nl
This world is a beginning and a base\nl
Where Life and Mind erect their structured dreams;\nl
An unborn Power must build reality.\nl
A deathbound littleness is not all we are:\nl
Immortal our forgotten vastnesses\nl
Await discovery in our summit selves;\nl
Unmeasured breadths and depths of being are ours.\nl
Akin to the ineffable Secrecy,\nl
Mystic, eternal in unrealised Time,\nl
Neighbours of Heaven are Nature's altitudes.\nl
To these high-peaked dominions sealed to our search,\nl
Too far from surface Nature's postal routes,\nl
Too lofty for our mortal lives to breathe,\nl
Deep in us a forgotten kinship points\nl
And a faint voice of ecstasy and prayer\nl
Calls to those lucent lost immensities.\nl
Even when we fail to look into our souls\nl
Or lie embedded in earthly consciousness,\nl
Still have we parts that grow towards the light,\nl
Yet are there luminous tracts and heavens serene\nl
And Eldorados of splendour and ecstasy\nl
Page 46

And temples to the godhead none can see.\nl
A shapeless memory lingers in us still\nl
And sometimes, when our sight is turned within,\nl
Earth's ignorant veil is lifted from our eyes;\nl
There is a short miraculous escape.\nl
This narrow fringe of clamped experience\nl
We leave behind meted to us as life,\nl
Our little walks, our insufficient reach.\nl
Our souls can visit in great lonely hours\nl
Still regions of imperishable Light,\nl
All-seeing eagle-peaks of silent Power\nl
And moon-flame oceans of swift fathomless Bliss\nl
And calm immensities of spirit space.\nl
In the unfolding process of the Self\nl
Sometimes the inexpressible Mystery\nl
Elects a human vessel of descent.\nl
A breath comes down from a supernal air,\nl
A Presence is born, a guiding Light awakes,\nl
A stillness falls upon the instruments:\nl
Fixed, motionless like a marble monument,\nl
Stone-calm, the body is a pedestal\nl
Supporting a figure of eternal Peace.\nl
Or a revealing Force sweeps blazing in;\nl
Out of some vast superior continent\nl
Knowledge breaks through trailing its radiant seas,\nl
And Nature trembles with the power, the flame.\nl
A greater Personality sometimes\nl
Possesses us which yet we know is ours:\nl
Or we adore the Master of our souls.\nl
Then the small bodily ego thins and falls;\nl
No more insisting on its separate self,\nl
Losing the punctilio of its separate birth,\nl
It leaves us one with Nature and with God.\nl
In moments when the inner lamps are lit\nl
And the life's cherished guests are left outside,\nl
Our spirit sits alone and speaks to its gulfs.\nl
Page 47

A wider consciousness opens then its doors;\nl
Invading from spiritual silences\nl
A ray of the timeless Glory stoops awhile\nl
To commune with our seized illumined clay\nl
And leaves its huge white stamp upon our lives.\nl
In the oblivious field of mortal mind,\nl
Revealed to the closed prophet eyes of trance\nl
Or in some deep internal solitude\nl
Witnessed by a strange immaterial sense,\nl
The signals of eternity appear.\nl
The truth mind could not know unveils its face,\nl
We hear what mortal ears have never heard,\nl
We feel what earthly sense has never felt,\nl
We love what common hearts repel and dread;\nl
Our minds hush to a bright Omniscient;\nl
A Voice calls from the chambers of the soul;\nl
We meet the ecstasy of the Godhead's touch\nl
In golden privacies of immortal fire.\nl
These signs are native to a larger self\nl
That lives within us by ourselves unseen;\nl
Only sometimes a holier influence comes,\nl
A tide of mightier surgings bears our lives\nl
And a diviner Presence moves the soul;\nl
Or through the earthly coverings something breaks,\nl
A grace and beauty of spiritual light,\nl
The murmuring tongue of a celestial fire.\nl
Ourself and a high stranger whom we feel,\nl
It is and acts unseen as if it were not;\nl
It follows the line of sempiternal birth,\nl
Yet seems to perish with its mortal frame.\nl
Assured of the Apocalypse to be,\nl
It reckons not the moments and the hours;\nl
Great, patient, calm it sees the centuries pass,\nl
Awaiting the slow miracle of our change\nl
In the sure deliberate process of world-force\nl
And the long march of all-revealing Time.\nl
Page 48

It is the origin and the master-clue,\nl
A silence overhead, an inner voice,\nl
A living image seated in the heart,\nl
An unwalled wideness and a fathomless point,\nl
The truth of all these cryptic shows in Space,\nl
The Real towards which our strivings move,\nl
The secret grandiose meaning of our lives.\nl
A treasure of honey in the combs of God,\nl
A Splendour burning in a tenebrous cloak,\nl
It is our glory of the flame of God,\nl
Our golden fountain of the world's delight,\nl
An immortality cowled in the cape of death,\nl
The shape of our unborn divinity.\nl
It guards for us our fate in depths within\nl
Where sleeps the eternal seed of transient things.\nl
Always we bear in us a magic key\nl
Concealed in life's hermetic envelope.\nl
A burning Witness in the sanctuary\nl
Regards through Time and the blind walls of Form;\nl
A timeless Light is in his hidden eyes;\nl
He sees the secret things no words can speak\nl
And knows the goal of the unconscious world\nl
And the heart of the mystery of the journeying years.\nl

\spar But all is screened, subliminal, mystical;\nl
It needs the intuitive heart, the inward turn,\nl
It needs the power of a spiritual gaze.\nl
Else to our waking mind's small moment look\nl
A goalless voyage seems our dubious course\nl
Some Chance has settled or hazarded some Will,\nl
Or a Necessity without aim or cause\nl
Unwillingly compelled to emerge and be.\nl
In this dense field where nothing is plain or sure,\nl
Our very being seems to us questionable,\nl
Our life a vague experiment, the soul\nl
A flickering light in a strange ignorant world,\nl
Page 49

The earth a brute mechanic accident,\nl
A net of death in which by chance we live.\nl
All we have learned appears a doubtful guess,\nl
The achievement done a passage or a phase\nl
Whose farther end is hidden from our sight,\nl
A chance happening or a fortuitous fate.\nl
Out of the unknown we move to the unknown.\nl
Ever surround our brief existence here\nl
Grey shadows of unanswered questionings;\nl
The dark Inconscient's signless mysteries\nl
Stand up unsolved behind Fate's starting-line.\nl
An aspiration in the Night's profound,\nl
Seed of a perishing body and half-lit mind,\nl
Uplifts its lonely tongue of conscious fire\nl
Towards an undying Light for ever lost;\nl
Only it hears, sole echo of its call,\nl
The dim reply in man's unknowing heart\nl
And meets, not understanding why it came\nl
Or for what reason is the suffering here,\nl
God's sanction to the paradox of life\nl
And the riddle of the Immortal's birth in Time.\nl
Along a path of aeons serpentine\nl
In the coiled blackness of her nescient course\nl
The Earth-Goddess toils across the sands of Time.\nl
A Being is in her whom she hopes to know,\nl
A Word speaks to her heart she cannot hear,\nl
A Fate compels whose form she cannot see.\nl
In her unconscious orbit through the Void\nl
Out of her mindless depths she strives to rise,\nl
A perilous life her gain, a struggling joy;\nl
A Thought that can conceive but hardly knows\nl
Arises slowly in her and creates\nl
The idea, the speech that labels more than it lights;\nl
A trembling gladness that is less than bliss\nl
Invades from all this beauty that must die.\nl
Alarmed by the sorrow dragging at her feet\nl
Page 50

And conscious of the high things not yet won,\nl
Ever she nurses in her sleepless breast\nl
An inward urge that takes from her rest and peace.\nl
Ignorant and weary and invincible,\nl
She seeks through the soul's war and quivering pain\nl
The pure perfection her marred nature needs,\nl
A breath of Godhead on her stone and mire.\nl
A faith she craves that can survive defeat,\nl
The sweetness of a love that knows not death,\nl
The radiance of a truth for ever sure.\nl
A light grows in her, she assumes a voice,\nl
Her state she learns to read and the act she has done,\nl
But the one needed truth eludes her grasp,\nl
Herself and all of which she is the sign.\nl
An inarticulate whisper drives her steps\nl
Of which she feels the force but not the sense;\nl
A few rare intimations come as guides,\nl
Immense divining flashes cleave her brain,\nl
And sometimes in her hours of dream and muse\nl
The truth that she has missed looks out on her\nl
As if far off and yet within her soul.\nl
A change comes near that flees from her surmise\nl
And, ever postponed, compels attempt and hope,\nl
Yet seems too great for mortal hope to dare.\nl
A vision meets her of supernal Powers\nl
That draw her as if mighty kinsmen lost\nl
Approaching with estranged great luminous gaze.\nl
Then is she moved to all that she is not\nl
And stretches arms to what was never hers.\nl
Outstretching arms to the unconscious Void,\nl
Passionate she prays to invisible forms of Gods\nl
Soliciting from dumb Fate and toiling Time\nl
What most she needs, what most exceeds her scope,\nl
A Mind unvisited by illusion's gleams,\nl
A Will expressive of soul's deity,\nl
A Strength not forced to stumble by its speed,\nl
Page 51

A Joy that drags not sorrow as its shade.\nl
For these she yearns and feels them destined hers:\nl
Heaven's privilege she claims as her own right.\nl
Just is her claim the all-witnessing Gods approve,\nl
Clear in a greater light than reason owns:\nl
Our intuitions are its title-deeds;\nl
Our souls accept what our blind thoughts refuse.\nl
Earth's winged chimaeras are Truth's steeds in Heaven,\nl
The impossible God's sign of things to be.\nl
But few can look beyond the present state\nl
Or overleap this matted hedge of sense.\nl
All that transpires on earth and all beyond\nl
Are parts of an illimitable plan\nl
The One keeps in his heart and knows alone.\nl
Our outward happenings have their seed within,\nl
And even this random Fate that imitates Chance,\nl
This mass of unintelligible results,\nl
Are the dumb graph of truths that work unseen:\nl
The laws of the Unknown create the known.\nl
The events that shape the appearance of our lives\nl
Are a cipher of subliminal quiverings\nl
Which rarely we surprise or vaguely feel,\nl
Are an outcome of suppressed realities\nl
That hardly rise into material day:\nl
They are born from the spirit's sun of hidden powers\nl
Digging a tunnel through emergency.\nl
But who shall pierce into the cryptic gulf\nl
And learn what deep necessity of the soul\nl
Determined casual deed and consequence?\nl
Absorbed in a routine of daily acts,\nl
Our eyes are fixed on an external scene;\nl
We hear the crash of the wheels of Circumstance\nl
And wonder at the hidden cause of things.\nl
Yet a foreseeing Knowledge might be ours,\nl
If we could take our spirit's stand within,\nl
If we could hear the muffled daemon voice.\nl
Page 52

Too seldom is the shadow of what must come\nl
Cast in an instant on the secret sense\nl
Which feels the shock of the invisible,\nl
And seldom in the few who answer give\nl
The mighty process of the cosmic Will\nl
Communicates its image to our sight,\nl
Identifying the world's mind with ours.\nl
Our range is fixed within the crowded arc\nl
Of what we observe and touch and thought can guess\nl
And rarely dawns the light of the Unknown\nl
Waking in us the prophet and the seer.\nl
The outward and the immediate are our field,\nl
The dead past is our background and support;\nl
Mind keeps the soul prisoner, we are slaves to our acts;\nl
We cannot free our gaze to reach wisdom's sun.\nl
Inheritor of the brief animal mind,\nl
Man, still a child in Nature's mighty hands,\nl
In the succession of the moments lives;\nl
To a changing present is his narrow right;\nl
His memory stares back at a phantom past,\nl
The future flees before him as he moves;\nl
He sees imagined garments, not a face.\nl
Armed with a limited precarious strength,\nl
He saves his fruits of work from adverse chance.\nl
A struggling ignorance is his wisdom's mate:\nl
He waits to see the consequence of his acts,\nl
He waits to weigh the certitude of his thoughts,\nl
He knows not what he shall achieve or when;\nl
He knows not whether at last he shall survive,\nl
Or end like the mastodon and the sloth\nl
And perish from the earth where he was king.\nl
He is ignorant of the meaning of his life,\nl
He is ignorant of his high and splendid fate.\nl
Only the Immortals on their deathless heights\nl
Dwelling beyond the walls of Time and Space,\nl
Masters of living, free from the bonds of Thought,\nl
Page 53

Who are overseers of Fate and Chance and Will\nl
And experts of the theorem of world-need,\nl
Can see the Idea, the Might that change Time's course,\nl
Come maned with light from undiscovered worlds,\nl
Hear, while the world toils on with its deep blind heart,\nl
The galloping hooves of the unforeseen event,\nl
Bearing the superhuman Rider, near\nl
And, impassive to earth's din and startled cry,\nl
Return to the silence of the hills of God;\nl
As lightning leaps, as thunder sweeps, they pass\nl
And leave their mark on the trampled breast of Life.\nl
Above the world the world-creators stand,\nl
In the phenomenon see its mystic source.\nl
These heed not the deceiving outward play,\nl
They turn not to the moment's busy tramp,\nl
But listen with the still patience of the Unborn\nl
For the slow footsteps of far Destiny\nl
Approaching through huge distances of Time,\nl
Unmarked by the eye that sees effect and cause,\nl
Unheard mid the clamour of the human plane.\nl
Attentive to an unseen Truth they seize\nl
A sound as of invisible augur wings,\nl
Voices of an unplumbed significance,\nl
Mutterings that brood in the core of Matter's sleep.\nl
In the heart's profound audition they can catch\nl
The murmurs lost by Life's uncaring ear,\nl
A prophet-speech in Thought's omniscient trance.\nl
Above the illusion of the hopes that pass,\nl
Behind the appearance and the overt act,\nl
Behind this clock-work Chance and vague surmise,\nl
Amid the wrestle of force, the trampling feet,\nl
Across the cries of anguish and of joy,\nl
Across the triumph, fighting and despair,\nl
They watch the Bliss for which earth's heart has cried\nl
On the long road which cannot see its end\nl
Winding undetected through the sceptic days\nl
Page 54

And to meet it guide the unheedful moving world.\nl
Thus will the masked Transcendent mount his throne.\nl
When darkness deepens strangling the earth's breast\nl
And man's corporeal mind is the only lamp,\nl
As a thief's in the night shall be the covert tread\nl
Of one who steps unseen into his house.\nl
A Voice ill-heard shall speak, the soul obey,\nl
A Power into mind's inner chamber steal,\nl
A charm and sweetness open life's closed doors\nl
And beauty conquer the resisting world,\nl
The Truth-Light capture Nature by surprise,\nl
A stealth of God compel the heart to bliss\nl
And earth grow unexpectedly divine.\nl
In Matter shall be lit the spirit's glow,\nl
In body and body kindled the sacred birth;\nl
Night shall awake to the anthem of the stars,\nl
The days become a happy pilgrim march,\nl
Our will a force of the Eternal's power,\nl
And thought the rays of a spiritual sun.\nl
A few shall see what none yet understands;\nl
God shall grow up while the wise men talk and sleep;\nl
For man shall not know the coming till its hour\nl
And belief shall be not till the work is done.\nl

\spar A Consciousness that knows not its own truth,\nl
A vagrant hunter of misleading dawns,\nl
Between the being's dark and luminous ends\nl
Moves here in a half-light that seems the whole:\nl
An interregnum in Reality\nl
Cuts off the integral Thought, the total Power;\nl
It circles or stands in a vague interspace,\nl
Doubtful of its beginning and its close,\nl
Or runs upon a road that has no end;\nl
Far from the original Dusk, the final Flame\nl
In some huge void Inconscience it lives,\nl
Like a thought persisting in a wide emptiness.\nl
Page 55

As if an unintelligible phrase\nl
Suggested a million renderings to the Mind,\nl
It lends a purport to a random world.\nl
A conjecture leaning upon doubtful proofs,\nl
A message misunderstood, a thought confused\nl
Missing its aim is all that it can speak\nl
Or a fragment of the universal word.\nl
It leaves two giant letters void of sense\nl
While without sanction turns the middle sign\nl
Carrying an enigmatic universe,\nl
As if a present without future or past\nl
Repeating the same revolution's whirl\nl
Turned on its axis in its own Inane.\nl
Thus is the meaning of creation veiled;\nl
For without context reads the cosmic page:\nl
Its signs stare at us like an unknown script,\nl
As if appeared screened by a foreign tongue\nl
Or code of splendour signs without a key\nl
A portion of a parable sublime.\nl
It wears to the perishable creature's eyes\nl
The grandeur of a useless miracle;\nl
Wasting itself that it may last awhile,\nl
A river that can never find its sea,\nl
It runs through life and death on an edge of Time;\nl
A fire in the Night is its mighty action's blaze.\nl
This is our deepest need to join once more\nl
What now is parted, opposite and twain,\nl
Remote in sovereign spheres that never meet\nl
Or fronting like far poles of Night and Day.\nl
We must fill the immense lacuna we have made,\nl
Re-wed the closed finite's lonely consonant\nl
With the open vowels of Infinity,\nl
A hyphen must connect Matter and Mind,\nl
The narrow isthmus of the ascending soul:\nl
We must renew the secret bond in things,\nl
Our hearts recall the lost divine Idea,\nl
Page 56

Reconstitute the perfect word, unite\nl
The Alpha and the Omega in one sound;\nl
Then shall the Spirit and Nature be at one.\nl
Two are the ends of the mysterious plan.\nl
In the wide signless ether of the Self,\nl
In the unchanging Silence white and nude,\nl
Aloof, resplendent like gold dazzling suns\nl
Veiled by the ray no mortal eye can bear,\nl
The Spirit's bare and absolute potencies\nl
Burn in the solitude of the thoughts of God.\nl
A rapture and a radiance and a hush,\nl
Delivered from the approach of wounded hearts,\nl
Denied to the Idea that looks at grief,\nl
Remote from the Force that cries out in its pain,\nl
In his inalienable bliss they live.\nl
Immaculate in self-knowledge and self-power,\nl
Calm they repose on the eternal Will.\nl
Only his law they count and him obey;\nl
They have no goal to reach, no aim to serve.\nl
Implacable in their timeless purity,\nl
All barter or bribe of worship they refuse;\nl
Unmoved by cry of revolt and ignorant prayer\nl
They reckon not our virtue and our sin;\nl
They bend not to the voices that implore,\nl
They hold no traffic with error and its reign;\nl
They are guardians of the silence of the Truth,\nl
They are keepers of the immutable decree.\nl
A deep surrender is their source of might,\nl
A still identity their way to know,\nl
Motionless is their action like a sleep.\nl
At peace, regarding the trouble beneath the stars,\nl
Deathless, watching the works of Death and Chance,\nl
Immobile, seeing the millenniums pass,\nl
Untouched while the long map of Fate unrolls,\nl
They look on our struggle with impartial eyes,\nl
And yet without them cosmos could not be.\nl
Page 57

Impervious to desire and doom and hope,\nl
Their station of inviolable might\nl
Moveless upholds the world's enormous task,\nl
Its ignorance is by their knowledge lit,\nl
Its yearning lasts by their indifference.\nl
As the height draws the low ever to climb,\nl
As the breadths draw the small to adventure vast,\nl
Their aloofness drives man to surpass himself.\nl
Our passion heaves to wed the Eternal's calm,\nl
Our dwarf-search mind to meet the Omniscient's light,\nl
Our helpless hearts to enshrine the Omnipotent's force.\nl
Acquiescing in the wisdom that made hell\nl
And the harsh utility of death and tears,\nl
Acquiescing in the gradual steps of Time,\nl
Careless they seem of the grief that stings the world's heart,\nl
Careless of the pain that rends its body and life;\nl
Above joy and sorrow is that grandeur's walk:\nl
They have no portion in the good that dies,\nl
Mute, pure, they share not in the evil done;\nl
Else might their strength be marred and could not save.\nl
Alive to the truth that dwells in God's extremes,\nl
Awake to a motion of all-seeing Force,\nl
The slow outcome of the long ambiguous years\nl
And the unexpected good from woeful deeds,\nl
The immortal sees not as we vainly see.\nl
He looks on hidden aspects and screened powers,\nl
He knows the law and natural line of things.\nl
Undriven by a brief life's will to act,\nl
Unharassed by the spur of pity and fear,\nl
He makes no haste to untie the cosmic knot\nl
Or the world's torn jarring heart to reconcile.\nl
In Time he waits for the Eternal's hour.\nl
Yet a spiritual secret aid is there;\nl
While a tardy Evolution's coils wind on\nl
And Nature hews her way through adamant\nl
A divine intervention thrones above.\nl
Page 58

Alive in a dead rotating universe\nl
We whirl not here upon a casual globe\nl
Abandoned to a task beyond our force;\nl
Even through the tangled anarchy called Fate\nl
And through the bitterness of death and fall\nl
An outstretched Hand is felt upon our lives.\nl
It is near us in unnumbered bodies and births;\nl
In its unslackening grasp it keeps for us safe\nl
The one inevitable supreme result\nl
No will can take away and no doom change,\nl
The crown of conscious Immortality,\nl
The godhead promised to our struggling souls\nl
When first man's heart dared death and suffered life.\nl
One who has shaped this world is ever its lord:\nl
Our errors are his steps upon the way;\nl
He works through the fierce vicissitudes of our lives,\nl
He works through the hard breath of battle and toil,\nl
He works through our sins and sorrows and our tears,\nl
His knowledge overrules our nescience;\nl
Whatever the appearance we must bear,\nl
Whatever our strong ills and present fate,\nl
When nothing we can see but drift and bale,\nl
A mighty Guidance leads us still through all.\nl
After we have served this great divided world\nl
God's bliss and oneness are our inborn right.\nl
A date is fixed in the calendar of the Unknown,\nl
An anniversary of the Birth sublime:\nl
Our soul shall justify its chequered walk,\nl
All will come near that now is naught or far.\nl
These calm and distant Mights shall act at last.\nl
Immovably ready for their destined task,\nl
The ever-wise compassionate Brilliances\nl
Await the sound of the Incarnate's voice\nl
To leap and bridge the chasms of Ignorance\nl
And heal the hollow yearning gulfs of Life\nl
And fill the abyss that is the universe.\nl

Here meanwhile at the Spirit's opposite pole\nl
In the mystery of the deeps that God has built\nl
For his abode below the Thinker's sight,\nl
In this compromise of a stark absolute Truth\nl
With the Light that dwells near the dark end of things,\nl
In this tragi-comedy of divine disguise,\nl
This long far seeking for joy ever near,\nl
In the grandiose dream of which the world is made,\nl
In this gold dome on a black dragon base,\nl
The conscious Force that acts in Nature's breast,\nl
A dark-robed labourer in the cosmic scheme\nl
Carrying clay images of unborn gods,\nl
Executrix of the inevitable Idea\nl
Hampered, enveloped by the hoops of Fate,\nl
Patient trustee of slow eternal Time,\nl
Absolves from hour to hour her secret charge.\nl
All she foresees in masked imperative depths;\nl
The dumb intention of the unconscious gulfs\nl
Answers to a will that sees upon the heights,\nl
And the evolving Word's first syllable\nl
Ponderous, brute-sensed, contains its luminous close,\nl
Privy to a summit victory's vast descent\nl
And the portent of the soul's immense uprise.\nl

\spar All here where each thing seems its lonely self\nl
Are figures of the sole transcendent One:\nl
Only by him they are, his breath is their life;\nl
An unseen Presence moulds the oblivious clay.\nl
A playmate in the mighty Mother's game,\nl
One came upon the dubious whirling globe\nl
To hide from her pursuit in force and form.\nl
A secret spirit in the Inconscient's sleep,\nl
A shapeless Energy, a voiceless Word,\nl
He was here before the elements could emerge,\nl
Before there was light of mind or life could breathe.\nl
Accomplice of her cosmic huge pretence,\nl
Page 60

His semblances he turns to real shapes\nl
And makes the symbol equal with the truth:\nl
He gives to his timeless thoughts a form in Time.\nl
He is the substance, he the self of things;\nl
She has forged from him her works of skill and might:\nl
She wraps him in the magic of her moods\nl
And makes of his myriad truths her countless dreams.\nl
The Master of being has come down to her,\nl
An immortal child born in the fugitive years.\nl
In objects wrought, in the persons she conceives,\nl
Dreaming she chases her idea of him,\nl
And catches here a look and there a gest:\nl
Ever he repeats in them his ceaseless births.\nl
He is the Maker and the world he made,\nl
He is the vision and he is the Seer;\nl
He is himself the actor and the act,\nl
He is himself the knower and the known,\nl
He is himself the dreamer and the dream.\nl
There are Two who are One and play in many worlds;\nl
In Knowledge and Ignorance they have spoken and met\nl
And light and darkness are their eyes' interchange;\nl
Our pleasure and pain are their wrestle and embrace,\nl
Our deeds, our hopes are intimate to their tale;\nl
They are married secretly in our thought and life.\nl
The universe is an endless masquerade:\nl
For nothing here is utterly what it seems;\nl
It is a dream-fact vision of a truth\nl
Which but for the dream would not be wholly true,\nl
A phenomenon stands out significant\nl
Against dim backgrounds of eternity;\nl
We accept its face and pass by all it means;\nl
A part is seen, we take it for the whole.\nl
Thus have they made their play with us for roles:\nl
Author and actor with himself as scene,\nl
He moves there as the Soul, as Nature she.\nl
Here on the earth where we must fill our parts,\nl
Page 61

We know not how shall run the drama's course;\nl
Our uttered sentences veil in their thought.\nl
Her mighty plan she holds back from our sight:\nl
She has concealed her glory and her bliss\nl
And disguised the Love and Wisdom in her heart;\nl
Of all the marvel and beauty that are hers,\nl
Only a darkened little we can feel.\nl
He too wears a diminished godhead here;\nl
He has forsaken his omnipotence,\nl
His calm he has foregone and infinity.\nl
He knows her only, he has forgotten himself;\nl
To her he abandons all to make her great.\nl
He hopes in her to find himself anew,\nl
Incarnate, wedding his infinity's peace\nl
To her creative passion's ecstasy.\nl
Although possessor of the earth and heavens,\nl
He leaves to her the cosmic management\nl
And watches all, the Witness of her scene.\nl
A supernumerary on her stage,\nl
He speaks no words or hides behind the wings.\nl
He takes birth in her world, waits on her will,\nl
Divines her enigmatic gesture's sense,\nl
The fluctuating chance turns of her mood,\nl
Works out her meanings she seems not to know\nl
And serves her secret purpose in long Time.\nl
As one too great for him he worships her;\nl
He adores her as his regent of desire,\nl
He yields to her as the mover of his will,\nl
He burns the incense of his nights and days\nl
Offering his life, a splendour of sacrifice.\nl
A rapt solicitor for her love and grace,\nl
His bliss in her to him is his whole world:\nl
He grows through her in all his being's powers;\nl
He reads by her God's hidden aim in things.\nl
Or, a courtier in her countless retinue,\nl
Content to be with her and feel her near\nl
Page 62

He makes the most of the little that she gives\nl
And all she does drapes with his own delight.\nl
A glance can make his whole day wonderful,\nl
A word from her lips with happiness wings the hours.\nl
He leans on her for all he does and is:\nl
He builds on her largesses his proud fortunate days\nl
And trails his peacock-plumaged joy of life\nl
And suns in the glory of her passing smile.\nl
In a thousand ways he serves her royal needs;\nl
He makes the hours pivot around her will,\nl
Makes all reflect her whims; all is their play:\nl
This whole wide world is only he and she.\nl

\spar This is the knot that ties together the stars:\nl
The Two who are one are the secret of all power,\nl
The Two who are one are the might and right in things.\nl
His soul, silent, supports the world and her,\nl
His acts are her commandment's registers.\nl
Happy, inert, he lies beneath her feet:\nl
His breast he offers for her cosmic dance\nl
Of which our lives are the quivering theatre,\nl
And none could bear but for his strength within,\nl
Yet none would leave because of his delight.\nl
His works, his thoughts have been devised by her,\nl
His being is a mirror vast of hers:\nl
Active, inspired by her he speaks and moves;\nl
His deeds obey her heart's unspoken demands:\nl
Passive, he bears the impacts of the world\nl
As if her touches shaping his soul and life:\nl
His journey through the days is her sun-march;\nl
He runs upon her roads; hers is his course.\nl
A witness and student of her joy and dole,\nl
A partner in her evil and her good,\nl
He has consented to her passionate ways,\nl
He is driven by her sweet and dreadful force.\nl
His sanctioning name initials all her works;\nl
Page 63

His silence is his signature to her deeds;\nl
In the execution of her drama's scheme,\nl
In her fancies of the moment and its mood,\nl
In the march of this obvious ordinary world\nl
Where all is deep and strange to the eyes that see\nl
And Nature's common forms are marvel-wefts,\nl
She through his witness sight and motion of might\nl
Unrolls the material of her cosmic Act,\nl
Her happenings that exalt and smite the soul,\nl
Her force that moves, her powers that save and slay,\nl
Her Word that in the silence speaks to our hearts,\nl
Her silence that transcends the summit Word,\nl
Her heights and depths to which our spirit moves,\nl
Her events that weave the texture of our lives\nl
And all by which we find or lose ourselves,\nl
Things sweet and bitter, magnificent and mean,\nl
Things terrible and beautiful and divine.\nl
Her empire in the cosmos she has built,\nl
He is governed by her subtle and mighty laws.\nl
His consciousness is a babe upon her knees,\nl
His being a field of her vast experiment,\nl
Her endless space is the playground of his thoughts;\nl
She binds to knowledge of the shapes of Time\nl
And the creative error of limiting mind\nl
And chance that wears the rigid face of fate\nl
And her sport of death and pain and Nescience,\nl
His changed and struggling immortality.\nl
His soul is a subtle atom in a mass,\nl
His substance a material for her works.\nl
His spirit survives amid the death of things,\nl
He climbs to eternity through being's gaps,\nl
He is carried by her from Night to deathless Light.\nl
This grand surrender is his free-will's gift,\nl
His pure transcendent force submits to hers.\nl
In the mystery of her cosmic ignorance,\nl
In the insoluble riddle of her play,\nl
Page 64

A creature made of perishable stuff,\nl
In the pattern she has set for him he moves,\nl
He thinks with her thoughts, with her trouble his bosom heaves;\nl
He seems the thing that she would have him seem,\nl
He is whatever her artist will can make.\nl
Although she drives him on her fancy's roads,\nl
At play with him as with her child or slave,\nl
To freedom and the Eternal's mastery\nl
And immortality's stand above the world,\nl
She moves her seeming puppet of an hour.\nl
Even in his mortal session in body's house,\nl
An aimless traveller between birth and death,\nl
Ephemeral dreaming of immortality,\nl
To reign she spurs him. He takes up her powers;\nl
He has harnessed her to the yoke of her own law.\nl
His face of human thought puts on a crown.\nl
Held in her leash, bound to her veiled caprice,\nl
He studies her ways if so he may prevail\nl
Even for an hour and she work out his will;\nl
He makes of her his moment passion's serf:\nl
To obey she feigns, she follows her creature's lead:\nl
For him she was made, lives only for his use.\nl
But conquering her, then is he most her slave;\nl
He is her dependent, all his means are hers;\nl
Nothing without her he can, she rules him still.\nl
At last he wakes to a memory of Self:\nl
He sees within the face of deity,\nl
The Godhead breaks out through the human mould:\nl
Her highest heights she unmasks and is his mate.\nl
Till then he is a plaything in her game;\nl
Her seeming regent, yet her fancy's toy,\nl
A living robot moved by her energy's springs,\nl
He acts as in the movements of a dream,\nl
An automaton stepping in the grooves of Fate,\nl
He stumbles on driven by her whip of Force:\nl
His thought labours, a bullock in Time's fields;\nl
Page 65

His will he thinks his own, is shaped in her forge.\nl
Obedient to World-Nature's dumb control,\nl
Driven by his own formidable Power,\nl
His chosen partner in a titan game,\nl
Her will he has made the master of his fate,\nl
Her whim the dispenser of his pleasure and pain;\nl
He has sold himself into her regal power\nl
For any blow or boon that she may choose:\nl
Even in what is suffering to our sense,\nl
He feels the sweetness of her mastering touch,\nl
In all experience meets her blissful hands;\nl
On his heart he bears the happiness of her tread\nl
And the surprise of her arrival's joy\nl
In each event and every moment's chance.\nl
All she can do is marvellous in his sight:\nl
He revels in her, a swimmer in her sea,\nl
A tireless amateur of her world-delight,\nl
He rejoices in her every thought and act\nl
And gives consent to all that she can wish;\nl
Whatever she desires he wills to be:\nl
The Spirit, the innumerable One,\nl
He has left behind his lone eternity,\nl
He is an endless birth in endless Time,\nl
Her finite's multitude in an infinite Space.\nl

And plays at hide-and-seek with his own Force;\nl
In Nature's instrument loiters secret God.\nl

A vast gymnasium of his works of might.\nl

Immortal, dallies with mortality.\nl

Where she lay in the featureless and formless hush\nl
Guarding from Time by her immobile sleep\nl

Has entered with his silence into space:\nl

The Absolute, the Perfect, the Immune,\nl
One who is in us as our secret self,\nl

Lifting our finite minds to his infinite,\nl
Touching the moment with eternity.\nl
This transfiguration is earth's due to heaven:\nl
A mutual debt binds man to the Supreme:\nl
His nature we must put on as he put ours;\nl

And perishable products of hard toil\nl
And transient splendours won and lost by the days.\nl

Takes deeper meanings to his inner view;\nl

And never can the mighty Traveller rest\nl
And never can the mystic voyage cease\nl
Till the nescient dusk is lifted from man's soul\nl
And the morns of God have overtaken his night.\nl
As long as Nature lasts, he too is there,\nl
For this is sure that he and she are one;\nl
Even when he sleeps, he keeps her on his breast:\nl
Whoever leaves her, he will not depart\nl
To repose without her in the Unknowable.\nl
There is a truth to know, a work to do;\nl
Her play is real; a Mystery he fulfils:\nl
There is a plan in the Mother's deep world-whim,\nl
A purpose in her vast and random game.\nl
This ever she meant since the first dawn of life,\nl
This constant will she covered with her sport,\nl
To evoke a Person in the impersonal Void,\nl
With the Truth-Light strike earth's massive roots of trance,\nl
Wake a dumb self in the inconscient depths\nl
Page 72

And raise a lost Power from its python sleep\nl
That the eyes of the Timeless might look out from Time\nl
And the world manifest the unveiled Divine.\nl
For this he left his white infinity\nl
And laid on the spirit the burden of the flesh,\nl
That Godhead's seed might flower in mindless Space.\nl

\sbigcap This knowledge first he had of time-born men.\nl
Admitted through a curtain of bright mind\nl
That hangs between our thoughts and absolute sight,\nl
He found the occult cave, the mystic door\nl
Near to the well of vision in the soul,\nl
And entered where the Wings of Glory brood\nl
In the silent space where all is for ever known.\nl
Indifferent to doubt and to belief,\nl
Avid of the naked real's single shock\nl
He shore the cord of mind that ties the earth-heart\nl
And cast away the yoke of Matter's law.\nl
The body's rules bound not the spirit's powers:\nl
When life had stopped its beats, death broke not in;\nl
He dared to live when breath and thought were still.\nl
Thus could he step into that magic place\nl
Which few can even glimpse with hurried glance\nl
Lifted for a moment from mind's laboured works\nl
And the poverty of Nature's earthly sight.\nl
All that the Gods have learned is there self-known.\nl
There in a hidden chamber closed and mute\nl
Are kept the record graphs of the cosmic scribe,\nl
And there the tables of the sacred Law,\nl
There is the Book of Being's index page;\nl
The text and glossary of the Vedic truth\nl
Are there; the rhythms and metres of the stars\nl
Significant of the movements of our fate:\nl
The symbol powers of number and of form,\nl
And the secret code of the history of the world\nl
And Nature's correspondence with the soul\nl
Are written in the mystic heart of Life.\nl
Page 74

In the glow of the spirit's room of memories\nl
He could recover the luminous marginal notes\nl
Dotting with light the crabbed ambiguous scroll,\nl
Rescue the preamble and the saving clause\nl
Of the dark Agreement by which all is ruled\nl
That rises from material Nature's sleep\nl
To clothe the Everlasting in new shapes.\nl
He could re-read now and interpret new\nl
Its strange symbol letters, scattered abstruse signs,\nl
Resolve its oracle and its paradox,\nl
Its riddling phrases and its blindfold terms,\nl
The deep oxymoron of its truth's repliques,\nl
And recognise as a just necessity\nl
Its hard conditions for the mighty work,—\nl
Nature's impossible Herculean toil\nl
Only her warlock-wisecraft could enforce,\nl
Its law of the opposition of the gods,\nl
Its list of inseparable contraries.\nl
The dumb great Mother in her cosmic trance\nl
Exploiting for creation's joy and pain\nl
Infinity's sanction to the birth of form,\nl
Accepts indomitably to execute\nl
The will to know in an inconscient world,\nl
The will to live under a reign of death,\nl
The thirst for rapture in a heart of flesh,\nl
And works out through the appearance of a soul\nl
By a miraculous birth in plasm and gas\nl
The mystery of God's covenant with the Night.\nl
Once more was heard in the still cosmic Mind\nl
The Eternal's promise to his labouring Force\nl
Inducing the world-passion to begin,\nl
The cry of birth into mortality\nl
And the opening verse of the tragedy of Time.\nl
Out of the depths the world's buried secret rose;\nl
He read the original ukase kept back\nl
In the locked archives of the spirit's crypt,\nl
Page 75

And saw the signature and fiery seal\nl
Of Wisdom on the dim Power's hooded work\nl
Who builds in Ignorance the steps of Light.\nl
A sleeping deity opened deathless eyes:\nl
He saw the unshaped thought in soulless forms,\nl
Knew Matter pregnant with spiritual sense,\nl
Mind dare the study of the Unknowable,\nl
Life its gestation of the Golden Child.\nl
In the light flooding thought's blank vacancy,\nl
Interpreting the universe by soul signs\nl
He read from within the text of the without:\nl
The riddle grew plain and lost its catch obscure.\nl
A larger lustre lit the mighty page.\nl
A purpose mingled with the whims of Time,\nl
A meaning met the stumbling pace of Chance\nl
And Fate revealed a chain of seeing Will;\nl
A conscious wideness filled the old dumb Space.\nl
In the Void he saw throned the Omniscience supreme.\nl

\spar A Will, a hope immense now seized his heart,\nl
And to discern the superhuman's form\nl
He raised his eyes to unseen spiritual heights,\nl
Aspiring to bring down a greater world.\nl
The glory he had glimpsed must be his home.\nl
A brighter heavenlier sun must soon illume\nl
This dusk room with its dark internal stair,\nl
The infant soul in its small nursery school\nl
Mid objects meant for a lesson hardly learned\nl
Outgrow its early grammar of intellect\nl
And its imitation of Earth-Nature's art,\nl
Its earthly dialect to God-language change,\nl
In living symbols study Reality\nl
And learn the logic of the Infinite.\nl
The Ideal must be Nature's common truth,\nl
The body illumined with the indwelling God,\nl
The heart and mind feel one with all that is,\nl
Page 76

A conscious soul live in a conscious world.\nl
As through a mist a sovereign peak is seen,\nl
The greatness of the eternal Spirit appeared,\nl
Exiled in a fragmented universe\nl
Amid half-semblances of diviner things.\nl
These now could serve no more his regal turn;\nl
The Immortal's pride refused the doom to live\nl
A miser of the scanty bargain made\nl
Between our littleness and bounded hopes\nl
And the compassionate Infinitudes.\nl
His height repelled the lowness of earth's state:\nl
A wideness discontented with its frame\nl
Resiled from poor assent to Nature's terms,\nl
The harsh contract spurned and the diminished lease.\nl
Only beginnings are accomplished here;\nl
Our base's Matter seems alone complete,\nl
An absolute machine without a soul.\nl
Or all seems a misfit of half ideas,\nl
Or we saddle with the vice of earthly form\nl
A hurried imperfect glimpse of heavenly things,\nl
Guesses and travesties of celestial types.\nl
Here chaos sorts itself into a world,\nl
A brief formation drifting in the void:\nl
Apings of knowledge, unfinished arcs of power,\nl
Flamings of beauty into earthly shapes,\nl
Love's broken reflexes of unity\nl
Swim, fragment-mirrorings of a floating sun.\nl
A packed assemblage of crude tentative lives\nl
Are pieced into a tessellated whole.\nl
There is no perfect answer to our hopes;\nl
There are blind voiceless doors that have no key;\nl
Thought climbs in vain and brings a borrowed light,\nl
Cheated by counterfeits sold to us in life's mart,\nl
Our hearts clutch at a forfeited heavenly bliss.\nl
There is provender for the mind's satiety,\nl
There are thrills of the flesh, but not the soul's desire.\nl
Page 77

Here even the highest rapture Time can give\nl
Is a mimicry of ungrasped beatitudes,\nl
A mutilated statue of ecstasy,\nl
A wounded happiness that cannot live,\nl
A brief felicity of mind or sense\nl
Thrown by the World-Power to her body-slave,\nl
Or a simulacrum of enforced delight\nl
In the seraglios of Ignorance.\nl
For all we have acquired soon loses worth,\nl
An old disvalued credit in Time's bank,\nl
Imperfection's cheque drawn on the Inconscient.\nl
An inconsequence dogs every effort made,\nl
And chaos waits on every cosmos formed:\nl
In each success a seed of failure lurks.\nl
He saw the doubtfulness of all things here,\nl
The incertitude of man's proud confident thought,\nl
The transience of the achievements of his force.\nl
A thinking being in an unthinking world,\nl
An island in the sea of the Unknown,\nl
He is a smallness trying to be great,\nl
An animal with some instincts of a god,\nl
His life a story too common to be told,\nl
His deeds a number summing up to nought,\nl
His consciousness a torch lit to be quenched,\nl
His hope a star above a cradle and grave.\nl
And yet a greater destiny may be his,\nl
For the eternal Spirit is his truth.\nl
He can re-create himself and all around\nl
And fashion new the world in which he lives:\nl
He, ignorant, is the Knower beyond Time,\nl
He is the Self above Nature, above Fate.\nl

\spar His soul retired from all that he had done.\nl
Hushed was the futile din of human toil,\nl
Forsaken wheeled the circle of the days;\nl
In distance sank the crowded tramp of life.\nl
Page 78

The Silence was his sole companion left.\nl
Impassive he lived immune from earthly hopes,\nl
A figure in the ineffable Witness' shrine\nl
Pacing the vast cathedral of his thoughts\nl
Under its arches dim with infinity\nl
And heavenward brooding of invisible wings.\nl
A call was on him from intangible heights;\nl
Indifferent to the little outpost Mind,\nl
He dwelt in the wideness of the Eternal's reign.\nl
His being now exceeded thinkable Space,\nl
His boundless thought was neighbour to cosmic sight:\nl
A universal light was in his eyes,\nl
A golden influx flowed through heart and brain;\nl
A Force came down into his mortal limbs,\nl
A current from eternal seas of Bliss;\nl
He felt the invasion and the nameless joy.\nl
Aware of his occult omnipotent Source,\nl
Allured by the omniscient Ecstasy,\nl
A living centre of the Illimitable\nl
Widened to equate with the world's circumference,\nl
He turned to his immense spiritual fate.\nl
Abandoned on a canvas of torn air,\nl
A picture lost in far and fading streaks,\nl
The earth-nature's summits sank below his feet:\nl
He climbed to meet the infinite more above.\nl
The Immobile's ocean-silence saw him pass,\nl
An arrow leaping through eternity\nl
Suddenly shot from the tense bow of Time,\nl
A ray returning to its parent sun.\nl
Opponent of that glory of escape,\nl
The black Inconscient swung its dragon tail\nl
Lashing a slumbrous Infinite by its force\nl
Into the deep obscurities of form:\nl
Death lay beneath him like a gate of sleep.\nl
One-pointed to the immaculate Delight,\nl
Questing for God as for a splendid prey,\nl
Page 79

He mounted burning like a cone of fire.\nl
To a few is given that godlike rare release.\nl
One among many thousands never touched,\nl
Engrossed in the external world's design,\nl
Is chosen by a secret witness Eye\nl
And driven by a pointing hand of Light\nl
Across his soul's unmapped immensitudes.\nl
A pilgrim of the everlasting Truth,\nl
Our measures cannot hold his measureless mind;\nl
He has turned from the voices of the narrow realm\nl
And left the little lane of human Time.\nl
In the hushed precincts of a vaster plan\nl
He treads the vestibules of the Unseen,\nl
Or listens following a bodiless Guide\nl
To a lonely cry in boundless vacancy.\nl
All the deep cosmic murmur falling still,\nl
He lives in the hush before the world was born,\nl
His soul left naked to the timeless One.\nl
Far from compulsion of created things\nl
Thought and its shadowy idols disappear,\nl
The moulds of form and person are undone:\nl
The ineffable Wideness knows him for its own.\nl
A lone forerunner of the Godward earth,\nl
Among the symbols of yet unshaped things\nl
Watched by closed eyes, mute faces of the Unborn,\nl
He journeys to meet the Incommunicable,\nl
Hearing the echo of his single steps\nl
In the eternal courts of Solitude.\nl
A nameless Marvel fills the motionless hours.\nl
His spirit mingles with eternity's heart\nl
And bears the silence of the Infinite.\nl

\spar In a divine retreat from mortal thought,\nl
In a prodigious gesture of soul-sight,\nl
His being towered into pathless heights,\nl
Naked of its vesture of humanity.\nl
Page 80

As thus it rose, to meet him bare and pure\nl
A strong Descent leaped down. A Might, a Flame,\nl
A Beauty half-visible with deathless eyes,\nl
A violent Ecstasy, a Sweetness dire,\nl
Enveloped him with its stupendous limbs\nl
And penetrated nerve and heart and brain\nl
That thrilled and fainted with the epiphany:\nl
His nature shuddered in the Unknown's grasp.\nl
In a moment shorter than death, longer than Time,\nl
By a Power more ruthless than Love, happier than Heaven,\nl
Taken sovereignly into eternal arms,\nl
Haled and coerced by a stark absolute bliss,\nl
In a whirlwind circuit of delight and force\nl
Hurried into unimaginable depths,\nl
Upborne into immeasurable heights,\nl
It was torn out from its mortality\nl
And underwent a new and bourneless change.\nl
An Omniscient knowing without sight or thought,\nl
An indecipherable Omnipotence,\nl
A mystic Form that could contain the worlds,\nl
Yet make one human breast its passionate shrine,\nl
Drew him out of his seeking loneliness\nl
Into the magnitudes of God's embrace.\nl
As when a timeless Eye annuls the hours\nl
Abolishing the agent and the act,\nl
So now his spirit shone out wide, blank, pure:\nl
His wakened mind became an empty slate\nl
On which the Universal and Sole could write.\nl
All that represses our fallen consciousness\nl
Was taken from him like a forgotten load:\nl
A fire that seemed the body of a god\nl
Consumed the limiting figures of the past\nl
And made large room for a new self to live.\nl
Eternity's contact broke the moulds of sense.\nl
A greater Force than the earthly held his limbs,\nl
Huge workings bared his undiscovered sheaths,\nl
Page 81

Strange energies wrought and screened tremendous hands\nl
Unwound the triple cord of mind and freed\nl
The heavenly wideness of a Godhead's gaze.\nl
As through a dress the wearer's shape is seen,\nl
There reached through forms to the hidden absolute\nl
A cosmic feeling and transcendent sight.\nl
Increased and heightened were the instruments.\nl
Illusion lost her aggrandising lens;\nl
As from her failing hand the measures fell,\nl
Atomic looked the things that loomed so large.\nl
The little ego's ring could join no more;\nl
In the enormous spaces of the self\nl
The body now seemed only a wandering shell,\nl
His mind the many-frescoed outer court\nl
Of an imperishable Inhabitant:\nl
His spirit breathed a superhuman air.\nl
The imprisoned deity rent its magic fence.\nl
As with a sound of thunder and of seas,\nl
Vast barriers crashed around the huge escape.\nl
Immutably coeval with the world,\nl
Circle and end of every hope and toil\nl
Inexorably drawn round thought and act,\nl
The fixed immovable peripheries\nl
Effaced themselves beneath the Incarnate's tread.\nl
The dire velamen and the bottomless crypt\nl
Between which life and thought for ever move,\nl
Forbidden still to cross the dim dread bounds,\nl
The guardian darknesses mute and formidable,\nl
Empowered to circumscribe the wingless spirit\nl
In the boundaries of Mind and Ignorance,\nl
Protecting no more a dual eternity\nl
Vanished rescinding their enormous role:\nl
Once figure of creation's vain ellipse,\nl
The expanding zero lost its giant curve.\nl
The old adamantine vetoes stood no more:\nl
Overpowered were earth and Nature's obsolete rule;\nl
Page 82

The python coils of the restricting Law\nl
Could not restrain the swift arisen God:\nl
Abolished were the scripts of destiny.\nl
There was no small death-hunted creature more,\nl
No fragile form of being to preserve\nl
From an all-swallowing Immensity.\nl
The great hammer-beats of a pent-up world-heart\nl
Burst open the narrow dams that keep us safe\nl
Against the forces of the universe.\nl
The soul and cosmos faced as equal powers.\nl
A boundless being in a measureless Time\nl
Invaded Nature with the infinite;\nl
He saw unpathed, unwalled, his titan scope.\nl

\spar All was uncovered to his sealless eye.\nl
A secret Nature stripped of her defence,\nl
Once in a dreaded half-light formidable,\nl
Overtaken in her mighty privacy\nl
Lay bare to the burning splendour of his will.\nl
In shadowy chambers lit by a strange sun\nl
And opening hardly to hid mystic keys\nl
Her perilous arcanes and hooded Powers\nl
Confessed the advent of a mastering Mind\nl
And bore the compulsion of a time-born gaze.\nl
Incalculable in their wizard modes,\nl
Immediate and invincible in the act,\nl
Her secret strengths native to greater worlds\nl
Lifted above our needy limited scope,\nl
The occult privilege of demigods\nl
And the sure power-pattern of her cryptic signs,\nl
Her diagrams of geometric force,\nl
Her potencies of marvel-fraught design\nl
Courted employment by an earth-nursed might.\nl
A conscious Nature's quick machinery\nl
Armed with a latent splendour of miracle\nl
The prophet-passion of a seeing Mind,\nl
Page 83

And the lightning bareness of a free soul-force.\nl
All once impossible deemed could now become\nl
A natural limb of possibility,\nl
A new domain of normalcy supreme.\nl
An almighty occultist erects in Space\nl
This seeming outward world which tricks the sense;\nl
He weaves his hidden threads of consciousness,\nl
He builds bodies for his shapeless energy;\nl
Out of the unformed and vacant Vast he has made\nl
His sorcery of solid images,\nl
His magic of formative number and design,\nl
The fixed irrational links none can annul,\nl
This criss-cross tangle of invisible laws;\nl
His infallible rules, his covered processes,\nl
Achieve unerringly an inexplicable\nl
Creation where our error carves dead frames\nl
Of knowledge for a living ignorance.\nl
In her mystery's moods divorced from the Maker's laws\nl
She too as sovereignly creates her field,\nl
Her will shaping the undetermined vasts,\nl
Making a finite of infinity;\nl
She too can make an order of her caprice,\nl
As if her rash superb wagered to outvie\nl
The veiled Creator's cosmic secrecies.\nl
The rapid footsteps of her fantasy,\nl
Amid whose falls wonders like flowers rise,\nl
Are surer than reason, defter than device\nl
And swifter than Imagination's wings.\nl
All she new-fashions by the thought and word,\nl
Compels all substance by her wand of Mind.\nl
Mind is a mediator divinity:\nl
Its powers can undo all Nature's work:\nl
Mind can suspend or change earth's concrete law.\nl
Affranchised from earth-habit's drowsy seal\nl
The leaden grip of Matter it can break;\nl
Indifferent to the angry stare of Death,\nl
Page 84

It can immortalise a moment's work:\nl
A simple fiat of its thinking force,\nl
The casual pressure of its slight assent\nl
Can liberate the Energy dumb and pent\nl
Within its chambers of mysterious trance:\nl
It makes the body's sleep a puissant arm,\nl
Holds still the breath, the beatings of the heart,\nl
While the unseen is found, the impossible done,\nl
Communicates without means the unspoken thought;\nl
It moves events by its bare silent will,\nl
Acts at a distance without hands or feet.\nl
This giant Ignorance, this dwarfish Life\nl
It can illumine with a prophet sight,\nl
Invoke the bacchic rapture, the Fury's goad,\nl
In our body arouse the demon or the god,\nl
Call in the Omniscient and Omnipotent,\nl
Awake a forgotten Almightiness within.\nl
In its own plane a shining emperor,\nl
Even in this rigid realm, Mind can be king:\nl
The logic of its demigod Idea\nl
In the leap of a transitional moment brings\nl
Surprises of creation never achieved\nl
Even by Matter's strange unconscious skill.\nl
All's miracle here and can by miracle change.\nl
This is that secret Nature's edge of might.\nl
On the margin of great immaterial planes,\nl
In kingdoms of an untrammelled glory of force,\nl
Where Mind is master of the life and form\nl
And soul fulfils its thoughts by its own power,\nl
She meditates upon mighty words and looks\nl
On the unseen links that join the parted spheres.\nl
Thence to the initiate who observes her laws\nl
She brings the light of her mysterious realms:\nl
Here where he stands, his feet on a prostrate world,\nl
His mind no more cast into Matter's mould,\nl
Over their bounds in spurts of splendid strength\nl
Page 85

She carries their magician processes\nl
And the formulas of their stupendous speech,\nl
Till heaven and hell become purveyors to earth\nl
And the universe the slave of mortal will.\nl
A mediatrix with veiled and nameless gods\nl
Whose alien will touches our human life,\nl
Imitating the World-Magician's ways\nl
She invents for her self-bound free-will its grooves\nl
And feigns for magic's freaks a binding cause.\nl
All worlds she makes the partners of her deeds,\nl
Accomplices of her mighty violence,\nl
Her daring leaps into the impossible:\nl
From every source she has taken her cunning means,\nl
She draws from the free-love marriage of the planes\nl
Elements for her creation's tour-de-force:\nl
A wonder-weft of knowledge incalculable,\nl
A compendium of divine invention's feats\nl
She has combined to make the unreal true\nl
Or liberate suppressed reality:\nl
In her unhedged Circean wonderland\nl
Pell-mell she shepherds her occult mightinesses;\nl
Her mnemonics of the craft of the Infinite,\nl
Jets of the screened subliminal's caprice,\nl
Tags of the gramarye of Inconscience,\nl
Freedom of a sovereign Truth without a law,\nl
Thoughts that were born in the immortals' world,\nl
Oracles that break out from behind the shrine,\nl
Warnings from the daemonic inner voice\nl
And peeps and lightning-leaps of prophecy\nl
And intimations to the inner ear,\nl
Abrupt interventions stark and absolute\nl
And the Superconscient's unaccountable acts,\nl
Have woven her balanced web of miracles\nl
And the weird technique of her tremendous art.\nl
This bizarre kingdom passed into his charge.\nl
As one resisting more the more she loves,\nl
Page 86

Her great possessions and her power and lore\nl
She gave, compelled, with a reluctant joy;\nl
Herself she gave for rapture and for use.\nl
Absolved from aberrations in deep ways,\nl
The ends she recovered for which she was made:\nl
She turned against the evil she had helped\nl
Her engined wrath, her invisible means to slay;\nl
Her dangerous moods and arbitrary force\nl
She surrendered to the service of the soul\nl
And the control of a spiritual will.\nl
A greater despot tamed her despotism.\nl
Assailed, surprised in the fortress of her self,\nl
Conquered by her own unexpected king,\nl
Fulfilled and ransomed by her servitude,\nl
She yielded in a vanquished ecstasy,\nl
Her sealed hermetic wisdom forced from her,\nl
Fragments of the mystery of omnipotence.\nl

\spar A border sovereign is the occult Force.\nl
A threshold guardian of the earth-scene's Beyond,\nl
She has canalised the outbreaks of the Gods\nl
And cut through vistas of intuitive sight\nl
A long road of shimmering discoveries.\nl
The worlds of a marvellous Unknown were near,\nl
Behind her an ineffable Presence stood:\nl
Her reign received their mystic influences,\nl
Their lion-forces crouched beneath her feet;\nl
The future sleeps unknown behind their doors.\nl
Abysms infernal gaped round the soul's steps\nl
And called to its mounting vision peaks divine:\nl
An endless climb and adventure of the Idea\nl
There tirelessly tempted the explorer mind\nl
And countless voices visited the charmed ear;\nl
A million figures passed and were seen no more.\nl
This was a forefront of God's thousandfold house,\nl
Beginnings of the half-screened Invisible.\nl
Page 87

A magic porch of entry glimmering\nl
Quivered in a penumbra of screened Light,\nl
A court of the mystical traffic of the worlds,\nl
A balcony and miraculous fa\c{c}ade.\nl
Above her lightened high immensities;\nl
All the unknown looked out from boundlessness:\nl
It lodged upon an edge of hourless Time,\nl
Gazing out of some everlasting Now,\nl
Its shadows gleaming with the birth of gods,\nl
Its bodies signalling the Bodiless,\nl
Its foreheads glowing with the Oversoul,\nl
Its forms projected from the Unknowable,\nl
Its eyes dreaming of the Ineffable,\nl
Its faces staring into eternity.\nl
Life in him learned its huge subconscient rear;\nl
The little fronts unlocked to the unseen Vasts:\nl
Her gulfs stood nude, her far transcendences\nl
Flamed in transparencies of crowded light.\nl

\spar A giant order was discovered here\nl
Of which the tassel and extended fringe\nl
Are the scant stuff of our material lives.\nl
This overt universe whose figures hide\nl
The secrets merged in superconscient light,\nl
Wrote clear the letters of its glowing code:\nl
A map of subtle signs surpassing thought\nl
Was hung upon a wall of inmost mind.\nl
Illumining the world's concrete images\nl
Into significant symbols by its gloss,\nl
It offered to the intuitive exegete\nl
Its reflex of the eternal Mystery.\nl
Ascending and descending twixt life's poles\nl
The seried kingdoms of the graded Law\nl
Plunged from the Everlasting into Time,\nl
Then glad of a glory of multitudinous mind\nl
And rich with life's adventure and delight\nl
Page 88

And packed with the beauty of Matter's shapes and hues\nl
Climbed back from Time into undying Self,\nl
Up a golden ladder carrying the soul,\nl
Tying with diamond threads the Spirit's extremes.\nl
In this drop from consciousness to consciousness\nl
Each leaned on the occult Inconscient's power,\nl
The fountain of its needed Ignorance,\nl
Archmason of the limits by which it lives.\nl
In this soar from consciousness to consciousness\nl
Each lifted tops to That from which it came,\nl
Origin of all that it had ever been\nl
And home of all that it could still become.\nl
An organ scale of the Eternal's acts,\nl
Mounting to their climax in an endless Calm,\nl
Paces of the many-visaged Wonderful,\nl
Predestined stadia of the evolving Way,\nl
Measures of the stature of the growing soul,\nl
They interpreted existence to itself\nl
And, mediating twixt the heights and deeps,\nl
United the veiled married opposites\nl
And linked creation to the Ineffable.\nl
A last high world was seen where all worlds meet;\nl
In its summit gleam where Night is not nor Sleep,\nl
The light began of the Trinity supreme.\nl
All there discovered what it seeks for here.\nl
It freed the finite into boundlessness\nl
And rose into its own eternities.\nl
The Inconscient found its heart of consciousness,\nl
The idea and feeling groping in Ignorance\nl
At last clutched passionately the body of Truth,\nl
The music born in Matter's silences\nl
Plucked nude out of the Ineffable's fathomlessness\nl
The meaning it had held but could not voice;\nl
The perfect rhythm now only sometimes dreamed\nl
An answer brought to the torn earth's hungry need\nl
Rending the night that had concealed the Unknown,\nl
Page 89

Giving to her her lost forgotten soul.\nl
A grand solution closed the long impasse\nl
In which the heights of mortal effort end.\nl
A reconciling Wisdom looked on life;\nl
It took the striving undertones of mind\nl
And took the confused refrain of human hopes\nl
And made of them a sweet and happy call;\nl
It lifted from an underground of pain\nl
The inarticulate murmur of our lives\nl
And found for it a sense illimitable.\nl
A mighty oneness its perpetual theme,\nl
It caught the soul's faint scattered utterances,\nl
Read hardly twixt our lines of rigid thought\nl
Or mid this drowse and coma on Matter's breast\nl
Heard like disjointed mutterings in sleep;\nl
It grouped the golden links that they had lost\nl
And showed to them their divine unity,\nl
Saving from the error of divided self\nl
The deep spiritual cry in all that is.\nl
All the great Words that toiled to express the One\nl
Were lifted into an absoluteness of light,\nl
An ever-burning Revelation's fire\nl
And the immortality of the eternal Voice.\nl
There was no quarrel more of truth with truth;\nl
The endless chapter of their differences\nl
Retold in light by an omniscient Scribe\nl
Travelled through difference towards unity,\nl
Mind's winding search lost every tinge of doubt\nl
Led to its end by an all-seeing speech\nl
That garbed the initial and original thought\nl
With the finality of an ultimate phrase:\nl
United were Time's creative mood and tense\nl
To the style and syntax of Identity.\nl
A paean swelled from the lost musing deeps;\nl
An anthem pealed to the triune ecstasies,\nl
A cry of the moments to the Immortal's bliss.\nl
Page 90

As if the strophes of a cosmic ode,\nl
A hierarchy of climbing harmonies\nl
Peopled with voices and with visages\nl
Aspired in a crescendo of the Gods\nl
From Matter's abysses to the Spirit's peaks.\nl
Above were the Immortal's changeless seats,\nl
White chambers of dalliance with eternity\nl
And the stupendous gates of the Alone.\nl
Across the unfolding of the seas of self\nl
Appeared the deathless countries of the One.\nl
A many-miracled Consciousness unrolled\nl
Vast aim and process and unfettered norms,\nl
A larger Nature's great familiar roads.\nl
Affranchised from the net of earthly sense\nl
Calm continents of potency were glimpsed;\nl
Homelands of beauty shut to human eyes,\nl
Half-seen at first through wonder's gleaming lids,\nl
Surprised the vision with felicity;\nl
Sunbelts of knowledge, moonbelts of delight\nl
Stretched out in an ecstasy of widenesses\nl
Beyond our indigent corporeal range.\nl
There he could enter, there awhile abide.\nl
A voyager upon uncharted routes\nl
Fronting the viewless danger of the Unknown,\nl
Adventuring across enormous realms,\nl
He broke into another Space and Time.\nl

\sbigcap Alone he moved watched by the infinity\nl
Around him and the Unknowable above.\nl
All could be seen that shuns the mortal eye,\nl
All could be known the mind has never grasped;\nl
All could be done no mortal will can dare.\nl
A limitless movement filled a limitless peace.\nl
In a profound existence beyond earth's\nl
Parent or kin to our ideas and dreams\nl
Where Space is a vast experiment of the soul,\nl
In an immaterial substance linked to ours\nl
In a deep oneness of all things that are,\nl
The universe of the Unknown arose.\nl
A self-creation without end or pause\nl
Revealed the grandeurs of the Infinite:\nl
It flung into the hazards of its play\nl
A million moods, a myriad energies,\nl
The world-shapes that are fancies of its Truth\nl
And the formulas of the freedom of its Force.\nl
It poured into the Ever-stable's flux\nl
A bacchic rapture and revel of Ideas,\nl
A passion and motion of everlastingness.\nl
There rose unborn into the Unchanging's surge\nl
Thoughts that abide in their deathless consequence,\nl
Words that immortal last though fallen mute,\nl
Acts that brought out from Silence its dumb sense,\nl
Lines that convey the inexpressible.\nl
The Eternal's stillness saw in unmoved joy\nl
His universal Power at work display\nl
In plots of pain and dramas of delight\nl
The wonder and beauty of her will to be.\nl
All, even pain, was the soul's pleasure here;\nl
Page 95

Here all experience was a single plan,\nl
The thousandfold expression of the One.\nl
All came at once into his single view;\nl
Nothing escaped his vast intuitive sight,\nl
Nothing drew near he could not feel as kin:\nl
He was one spirit with that immensity.\nl
Images in a supernal consciousness\nl
Embodying the Unborn who never dies,\nl
The structured visions of the cosmic Self\nl
Alive with the touch of being's eternity\nl
Looked at him like form-bound spiritual thoughts\nl
Figuring the movements of the Ineffable.\nl
Aspects of being donned world-outline; forms\nl
That open moving doors on things divine,\nl
Became familiar to his hourly sight;\nl
The symbols of the Spirit's reality,\nl
The living bodies of the Bodiless\nl
Grew near to him, his daily associates.\nl
The exhaustless seeings of the unsleeping Mind,\nl
Letterings of its contact with the invisible,\nl
Surrounded him with countless pointing signs;\nl
The voices of a thousand realms of Life\nl
Missioned to him her mighty messages.\nl
The heaven-hints that invade our earthly lives,\nl
The dire imaginations dreamed by Hell,\nl
Which if enacted and experienced here\nl
Our dulled capacity soon would cease to feel\nl
Or our mortal frailty could not long endure,\nl
Were set in their sublime proportions there.\nl
There lived out in their self-born atmosphere,\nl
They resumed their topless pitch and native power;\nl
Their fortifying stress upon the soul\nl
Bit deep into the ground of consciousness\nl
The passion and purity of their extremes,\nl
The absoluteness of their single cry\nl
And the sovereign sweetness or violent poetry\nl
Page 96

Of their beautiful or terrible delight.\nl
All thought can know or widest sight perceive\nl
And all that thought and sight can never know,\nl
All things occult and rare, remote and strange\nl
Were near to heart's contact, felt by spirit-sense.\nl
Asking for entry at his nature's gates\nl
They crowded the widened spaces of his mind,\nl
His self-discovery's flaming witnesses,\nl
Offering their marvel and their multitude.\nl
These now became new portions of himself,\nl
The figures of his spirit's greater life,\nl
The moving scenery of his large time-walk\nl
Or the embroidered tissue of his sense:\nl
These took the place of intimate human things\nl
And moved as close companions of his thoughts,\nl
Or were his soul's natural environment.\nl
Tireless the heart's adventure of delight,\nl
Endless the kingdoms of the Spirit's bliss,\nl
Unnumbered tones struck from one harmony's strings;\nl
Each to its wide-winged universal poise,\nl
Its fathomless feeling of the All in one,\nl
Brought notes of some perfection yet unseen,\nl
Its single retreat into Truth's secrecies,\nl
Its happy sidelight on the Infinite.\nl
All was found there the Unique has dreamed and made\nl
Tinging with ceaseless rapture and surprise\nl
And an opulent beauty of passionate difference\nl
The recurring beat that moments God in Time.\nl
Only was missing the sole timeless Word\nl
That carries eternity in its lonely sound,\nl
The Idea self-luminous key to all ideas,\nl
The integer of the Spirit's perfect sum\nl
That equates the unequal All to the equal One,\nl
The single sign interpreting every sign,\nl
The absolute index to the Absolute.\nl
Page 97

\spar There walled apart by its own innerness\nl
In a mystical barrage of dynamic light\nl
He saw a lone immense high-curved world-pile\nl
Erect like a mountain-chariot of the Gods\nl
Motionless under an inscrutable sky.\nl
As if from Matter's plinth and viewless base\nl
To a top as viewless, a carved sea of worlds\nl
Climbing with foam-maned waves to the Supreme\nl
Ascended towards breadths immeasurable;\nl
It hoped to soar into the Ineffable's reign:\nl
A hundred levels raised it to the Unknown.\nl
So it towered up to heights intangible\nl
And disappeared in the hushed conscious Vast\nl
As climbs a storeyed temple-tower to heaven\nl
Built by the aspiring soul of man to live\nl
Near to his dream of the Invisible.\nl
Infinity calls to it as it dreams and climbs;\nl
Its spire touches the apex of the world;\nl
Mounting into great voiceless stillnesses\nl
It marries the earth to screened eternities.\nl
Amid the many systems of the One\nl
Made by an interpreting creative joy\nl
Alone it points us to our journey back\nl
Out of our long self-loss in Nature's deeps;\nl
Planted on earth it holds in it all realms:\nl
It is a brief compendium of the Vast.\nl
This was the single stair to being's goal.\nl
A summary of the stages of the spirit,\nl
Its copy of the cosmic hierarchies\nl
Refashioned in our secret air of self\nl
A subtle pattern of the universe.\nl
It is within, below, without, above.\nl
Acting upon this visible Nature's scheme\nl
It wakens our earth-matter's heavy doze\nl
To think and feel and to react to joy;\nl
It models in us our diviner parts,\nl
Page 98

Lifts mortal mind into a greater air,\nl
Makes yearn this life of flesh to intangible aims,\nl
Links the body's death with immortality's call:\nl
Out of the swoon of the Inconscience\nl
It labours towards a superconscient Light.\nl
If earth were all and this were not in her,\nl
Thought could not be nor life-delight's response:\nl
Only material forms could then be her guests\nl
Driven by an inanimate world-force.\nl
Earth by this golden superfluity\nl
Bore thinking man and more than man shall bear;\nl
This higher scheme of being is our cause\nl
And holds the key to our ascending fate;\nl
It calls out of our dense mortality\nl
The conscious spirit nursed in Matter's house.\nl
The living symbol of these conscious planes,\nl
Its influences and godheads of the unseen,\nl
Its unthought logic of Reality's acts\nl
Arisen from the unspoken truth in things,\nl
Have fixed our inner life's slow-scaled degrees.\nl
Its steps are paces of the soul's return\nl
From the deep adventure of material birth,\nl
A ladder of delivering ascent\nl
And rungs that Nature climbs to deity.\nl
Once in the vigil of a deathless gaze\nl
These grades had marked her giant downward plunge,\nl
The wide and prone leap of a godhead's fall.\nl
Our life is a holocaust of the Supreme.\nl
The great World-Mother by her sacrifice\nl
Has made her soul the body of our state;\nl
Accepting sorrow and unconsciousness\nl
Divinity's lapse from its own splendours wove\nl
The many-patterned ground of all we are.\nl
An idol of self is our mortality.\nl
Our earth is a fragment and a residue;\nl
Her power is packed with the stuff of greater worlds\nl
Page 99

And steeped in their colour-lustres dimmed by her drowse;\nl
An atavism of higher births is hers,\nl
Her sleep is stirred by their buried memories\nl
Recalling the lost spheres from which they fell.\nl
Unsatisfied forces in her bosom move;\nl
They are partners of her greater growing fate\nl
And her return to immortality;\nl
They consent to share her doom of birth and death;\nl
They kindle partial gleams of the All and drive\nl
Her blind laborious spirit to compose\nl
A meagre image of the mighty Whole.\nl
The calm and luminous Intimacy within\nl
Approves her work and guides the unseeing Power.\nl
His vast design accepts a puny start.\nl
An attempt, a drawing half-done is the world's life;\nl
Its lines doubt their concealed significance,\nl
Its curves join not their high intended close.\nl
Yet some first image of greatness trembles there,\nl
And when the ambiguous crowded parts have met\nl
The many-toned unity to which they moved,\nl
The Artist's joy shall laugh at reason's rules;\nl
The divine intention suddenly shall be seen,\nl
The end vindicate intuition's sure technique.\nl
A graph shall be of many meeting worlds,\nl
A cube and union-crystal of the gods;\nl
A Mind shall think behind Nature's mindless mask,\nl
A conscious Vast fill the old dumb brute Space.\nl
This faint and fluid sketch of soul called man\nl
Shall stand out on the background of long Time\nl
A glowing epitome of eternity,\nl
A little point reveal the infinitudes.\nl
A Mystery's process is the universe.\nl
At first was laid a strange anomalous base,\nl
A void, a cipher of some secret Whole,\nl
Where zero held infinity in its sum\nl
And All and Nothing were a single term,\nl
Page 100

An eternal negative, a matrix Nought:\nl
Into its forms the Child is ever born\nl
Who lives for ever in the vasts of God.\nl
A slow reversal's movement then took place:\nl
A gas belched out from some invisible Fire,\nl
Of its dense rings were formed these million stars;\nl
Upon earth's new-born soil God's tread was heard.\nl
Across the thick smoke of earth's ignorance\nl
A Mind began to see and look at forms\nl
And groped for knowledge in the nescient Night:\nl
Caught in a blind stone-grip Force worked its plan\nl
And made in sleep this huge mechanical world,\nl
That Matter might grow conscious of its soul\nl
And like a busy midwife the life-power\nl
Deliver the zero carrier of the All.\nl
Because eternal eyes turned on earth's gulfs\nl
The lucent clarity of a pure regard\nl
And saw a shadow of the Unknowable\nl
Mirrored in the Inconscient's boundless sleep,\nl
Creation's search for self began its stir.\nl
A spirit dreamed in the crude cosmic whirl,\nl
Mind flowed unknowing in the sap of life\nl
And Matter's breasts suckled the divine Idea.\nl
A miracle of the Absolute was born;\nl
Infinity put on a finite soul,\nl
All ocean lived within a wandering drop,\nl
A time-made body housed the Illimitable.\nl
To live this Mystery out our souls came here.\nl

\spar A Seer within who knows the ordered plan\nl
Concealed behind our momentary steps,\nl
Inspires our ascent to viewless heights\nl
As once the abysmal leap to earth and life.\nl
His call had reached the Traveller in Time.\nl
Apart in an unfathomed loneliness,\nl
He travelled in his mute and single strength\nl
Page 101

Bearing the burden of the world's desire.\nl
A formless Stillness called, a nameless Light.\nl
Above him was the white immobile Ray,\nl
Around him the eternal Silences.\nl
No term was fixed to the high-pitched attempt;\nl
World after world disclosed its guarded powers,\nl
Heaven after heaven its deep beatitudes,\nl
But still the invisible Magnet drew his soul.\nl
A figure sole on Nature's giant stair,\nl
He mounted towards an indiscernible end\nl
On the bare summit of created things.\nl

\par
\sbigcap In the impalpable field of secret self,\nl
This little outer being's vast support\nl
Parted from vision by earth's solid fence,\nl
He came into a magic crystal air\nl
And found a life that lived not by the flesh,\nl
A light that made visible immaterial things.\nl
A fine degree in wonder's hierarchy,\nl
The kingdom of subtle Matter's faery craft\nl
Outlined against a sky of vivid hues,\nl
Leaping out of a splendour-trance and haze,\nl
The wizard revelation of its front.\nl
A world of lovelier forms lies near to ours,\nl
Where, undisguised by earth's deforming sight,\nl
All shapes are beautiful and all things true.\nl
In that lucent ambience mystically clear\nl
The eyes were doors to a celestial sense,\nl
Hearing was music and the touch a charm,\nl
And the heart drew a deeper breath of power.\nl
There dwell earth-nature's shining origins:\nl
The perfect plans on which she moulds her works,\nl
The distant outcomes of her travailing force,\nl
Repose in a framework of established fate.\nl
Attempted vainly now or won in vain,\nl
Already were mapped and scheduled there the time\nl
And figure of her future sovereignties\nl
In the sumptuous lineaments traced by desire.\nl
The golden issue of mind's labyrinth plots,\nl
The riches unfound or still uncaught by our lives,\nl
Unsullied by the attaint of mortal thought\nl
Abide in that pellucid atmosphere.\nl
Our vague beginnings are overtaken there,\nl
Page 103

Our middle terms sketched out in prescient lines,\nl
Our finished ends anticipated live.\nl
This brilliant roof of our descending plane,\nl
Intercepting the free boon of heaven's air,\nl
Admits small inrushes of a mighty breath\nl
Or fragrant circuits through gold lattices;\nl
It shields our ceiling of terrestrial mind\nl
From deathless suns and the streaming of God's rain,\nl
Yet canalises a strange irised glow,\nl
And bright dews drip from the Immortal's sky.\nl
A passage for the Powers that move our days,\nl
Occult behind this grosser Nature's walls,\nl
A gossamer marriage-hall of Mind with Form\nl
Is hidden by a tapestry of dreams;\nl
Heaven's meanings steal through it as through a veil,\nl
Its inner sight sustains this outer scene.\nl
A finer consciousness with happier lines,\nl
It has a tact our touch cannot attain,\nl
A purity of sense we never feel;\nl
Its intercession with the eternal Ray\nl
Inspires our transient earth's brief-lived attempts\nl
At beauty and the perfect shape of things.\nl
In rooms of the young divinity of power\nl
And early play of the eternal Child\nl
The embodiments of his outwinging thoughts\nl
Laved in a bright everlasting wonder's tints\nl
And lulled by whispers of that lucid air\nl
Take dream-hued rest like birds on timeless trees\nl
Before they dive to float on earth-time's sea.\nl
All that here seems has lovelier semblance there.\nl
Whatever our hearts conceive, our heads create,\nl
Some high original beauty forfeiting,\nl
Thence exiled here consents to an earthly tinge.\nl
Whatever is here of visible charm and grace\nl
Finds there its faultless and immortal lines;\nl
All that is beautiful here is there divine.\nl
Page 104

Figures are there undreamed by mortal mind:\nl
Bodies that have no earthly counterpart\nl
Traverse the inner eye's illumined trance\nl
And ravish the heart with their celestial tread\nl
Persuading heaven to inhabit that wonder sphere.\nl
The future's marvels wander in its gulfs;\nl
Things old and new are fashioned in those depths:\nl
A carnival of beauty crowds the heights\nl
In that magic kingdom of ideal sight.\nl
In its antechambers of splendid privacy\nl
Matter and soul in conscious union meet\nl
Like lovers in a lonely secret place:\nl
In the clasp of a passion not yet unfortunate\nl
They join their strength and sweetness and delight\nl
And mingling make the high and low worlds one.\nl
Intruder from the formless Infinite\nl
Daring to break into the Inconscient's reign,\nl
The spirit's leap towards body touches ground.\nl
As yet unwrapped in earthly lineaments,\nl
Already it wears outlasting death and birth,\nl
Convincing the abyss by heavenly form,\nl
A covering of its immortality\nl
Alive to the lustre of the wearer's rank,\nl
Fit to endure the rub of Change and Time.\nl
A tissue mixed of the soul's radiant light\nl
And Matter's substance of sign-burdened Force,—\nl
Imagined vainly in our mind's thin air\nl
An abstract phantasm mould of mental make,—\nl
It feels what earthly bodies cannot feel\nl
And is more real than this grosser frame.\nl
After the falling of mortality's cloak\nl
Lightened is its weight to heighten its ascent;\nl
Refined to the touch of finer environments\nl
It drops old patterned palls of denser stuff,\nl
Cancels the grip of earth's descending pull\nl
And bears the soul from world to higher world,\nl
Page 105

Till in the naked ether of the peaks\nl
The spirit's simplicity alone is left,\nl
The eternal being's first transparent robe.\nl
But when it must come back to its mortal load\nl
And the hard ensemble of earth's experience,\nl
Then its return resumes that heavier dress.\nl
For long before earth's solid vest was forged\nl
By the technique of the atomic Void,\nl
A lucent envelope of self-disguise\nl
Was woven round the secret spirit in things.\nl
The subtle realms from those bright sheaths are made.\nl
This wonder-world with all its radiant boon\nl
Of vision and inviolate happiness,\nl
Only for expression cares and perfect form;\nl
Fair on its peaks, it has dangerous nether planes;\nl
Its light draws towards the verge of Nature's lapse;\nl
It lends beauty to the terror of the gulfs\nl
And fascinating eyes to perilous Gods,\nl
Invests with grace the demon and the snake.\nl
Its trance imposes earth's inconscience,\nl
Immortal it weaves for us death's sombre robe\nl
And authorises our mortality.\nl
This medium serves a greater Consciousness:\nl
A vessel of its concealed autocracy,\nl
It is the subtle ground of Matter's worlds,\nl
It is the immutable in their mutable forms,\nl
In the folds of its creative memory\nl
It guards the deathless type of perishing things:\nl
Its lowered potencies found our fallen strengths;\nl
Its thought invents our reasoned ignorance;\nl
Its sense fathers our body's reflexes.\nl
Our secret breath of untried mightier force,\nl
The lurking sun of an instant's inner sight,\nl
Its fine suggestions are a covert fount\nl
For our iridescent rich imaginings\nl
Touching things common with transfiguring hues\nl
Page 106

Till even earth's mud grows rich and warm with the skies\nl
And a glory gleams from the soul's decadence.\nl
Its knowledge is our error's starting-point;\nl
Its beauty dons our mud-mask ugliness,\nl
Its artist good begins our evil's tale.\nl
A heaven of creative truths above,\nl
A cosmos of harmonious dreams between,\nl
A chaos of dissolving forms below,\nl
It plunges lost in our inconscient base.\nl
Out of its fall our denser Matter came.\nl

\spar Thus taken was God's plunge into the Night.\nl
This fallen world became a nurse of souls\nl
Inhabited by concealed divinity.\nl
A Being woke and lived in the meaningless void,\nl
A world-wide Nescience strove towards life and thought,\nl
A Consciousness plucked out from mindless sleep.\nl
All here is driven by an insentient will.\nl
Thus fallen, inconscient, frustrate, dense, inert,\nl
Sunk into inanimate and torpid drowse\nl
Earth lay, a drudge of sleep, forced to create\nl
By a subconscient yearning memory\nl
Left from a happiness dead before she was born,\nl
An alien wonder on her senseless breast.\nl
This mire must harbour the orchid and the rose,\nl
From her blind unwilling substance must emerge\nl
A beauty that belongs to happier spheres.\nl
This is the destiny bequeathed to her,\nl
As if a slain god left a golden trust\nl
To a blind force and an imprisoned soul.\nl
An immortal godhead's perishable parts\nl
She must reconstitute from fragments lost,\nl
Reword from a document complete elsewhere\nl
Her doubtful title to her divine Name.\nl
A residue her sole inheritance,\nl
All things she carries in her shapeless dust.\nl
Page 107

Her giant energy tied to petty forms\nl
In the slow tentative motion of her power\nl
With only frail blunt instruments for use,\nl
She has accepted as her nature's need\nl
And given to man as his stupendous work\nl
A labour to the gods impossible.\nl
A life living hardly in a field of death\nl
Its portion claims of immortality;\nl
A brute half-conscious body serves as means\nl
A mind that must recover a knowledge lost\nl
Held in stone grip by the world's inconscience,\nl
And wearing still these countless knots of Law\nl
A spirit bound stand up as Nature's king.\nl
\sparn A mighty kinship is this daring's cause.\nl
All we attempt in this imperfect world,\nl
Looks forward or looks back beyond Time's gloss\nl
To its pure idea and firm inviolate type\nl
In an absolute creation's flawless skill.\nl
To seize the absolute in shapes that pass,\nl
To fix the eternal's touch in time-made things,\nl
This is the law of all perfection here.\nl
A fragment here is caught of heaven's design;\nl
Else could we never hope for greater life\nl
And ecstasy and glory could not be.\nl
Even in the littleness of our mortal state,\nl
Even in this prison-house of outer form,\nl
A brilliant passage for the infallible Flame\nl
Is driven through gross walls of nerve and brain,\nl
A Splendour presses or a Power breaks through,\nl
Earth's great dull barrier is removed awhile,\nl
The inconscient seal is lifted from our eyes\nl
And we grow vessels of creative might.\nl
The enthusiasm of a divine surprise\nl
Pervades our life, a mystic stir is felt,\nl
A joyful anguish trembles in our limbs;\nl
A dream of beauty dances through the heart,\nl
Page 108

A thought from the eternal Mind draws near,\nl
Intimations cast from the Invisible\nl
Awaking from Infinity's sleep come down,\nl
Symbols of That which never yet was made.\nl
But soon the inert flesh responds no more,\nl
Then sinks the sacred orgy of delight,\nl
The blaze of passion and the tide of power\nl
Are taken from us and, though a glowing form\nl
Abides astonishing earth, imagined supreme,\nl
Too little of what was meant has left a trace.\nl
Earth's eyes half-see, her forces half-create;\nl
Her rarest works are copies of heaven's art.\nl
A radiance of a golden artifice,\nl
A masterpiece of inspired device and rule,\nl
Her forms hide what they house and only mime\nl
The unseized miracle of self-born shapes\nl
That live for ever in the Eternal's gaze.\nl
Here in a difficult half-finished world\nl
Is a slow toiling of unconscious Powers;\nl
Here is man's ignorant divining mind,\nl
His genius born from an inconscient soil.\nl
To copy on earth's copies is his art.\nl
For when he strives for things surpassing earth,\nl
Too rude the workman's tools, too crude his stuff,\nl
And hardly with his heart's blood he achieves\nl
His transient house of the divine Idea,\nl
His figure of a Time-inn for the Unborn.\nl
Our being thrills with high far memories\nl
And would bring down their dateless meanings here,\nl
But, too divine for earthly Nature's scheme,\nl
Beyond our reach the eternal marvels blaze.\nl
Absolute they dwell, unborn, immutable,\nl
Immaculate in the Spirit's deathless air,\nl
Immortal in a world of motionless Time\nl
And an unchanging muse of deep self-space.\nl
Only when we have climbed above ourselves,\nl
Page 109

A line of the Transcendent meets our road\nl
And joins us to the timeless and the true;\nl
It brings to us the inevitable word,\nl
The godlike act, the thoughts that never die.\nl
A ripple of light and glory wraps the brain,\nl
And travelling down the moment's vanishing route\nl
The figures of eternity arrive.\nl
As the mind's visitors or the heart's guests\nl
They espouse our mortal brevity awhile,\nl
Or seldom in some rare delivering glimpse\nl
Are caught by our vision's delicate surmise.\nl
Although beginnings only and first attempts,\nl
These glimmerings point to the secret of our birth\nl
And the hidden miracle of our destiny.\nl
What we are there and here on earth shall be\nl
Is imaged in a contact and a call.\nl
As yet earth's imperfection is our sphere,\nl
Our nature's glass shows not our real self;\nl
That greatness still abides held back within.\nl
Earth's doubting future hides our heritage:\nl
The Light now distant shall grow native here,\nl
The Strength that visits us our comrade power;\nl
The Ineffable shall find a secret voice,\nl
The Imperishable burn through Matter's screen\nl
Making this mortal body godhead's robe.\nl
The Spirit's greatness is our timeless source\nl
And it shall be our crown in endless Time.\nl
A vast Unknown is round us and within;\nl
All things are wrapped in the dynamic One:\nl
A subtle link of union joins all life.\nl
Thus all creation is a single chain:\nl
We are not left alone in a closed scheme\nl
Between a driving of inconscient Force\nl
And an incommunicable Absolute.\nl
Our life is a spur in a sublime soul-range,\nl
Our being looks beyond its walls of mind\nl
Page 110

And it communicates with greater worlds;\nl
There are brighter earths and wider heavens than ours.\nl
There are realms where Being broods in its own depths;\nl
It feels in its immense dynamic core\nl
Its nameless, unformed, unborn potencies\nl
Cry for expression in the unshaped Vast:\nl
Ineffable beyond Ignorance and death,\nl
The images of its everlasting Truth\nl
Look out from a chamber of its self-rapt soul:\nl
As if to its own inner witness gaze\nl
The Spirit holds up its mirrored self and works,\nl
The power and passion of its timeless heart,\nl
The figures of its formless ecstasy,\nl
The grandeurs of its multitudinous might.\nl
Thence comes the mystic substance of our souls\nl
Into the prodigy of our nature's birth,\nl
There is the unfallen height of all we are\nl
And dateless fount of all we hope to be.\nl
On every plane the hieratic Power,\nl
Initiate of unspoken verities,\nl
Dreams to transcribe and make a part of life\nl
In its own native style and living tongue\nl
Some trait of the perfection of the Unborn,\nl
Some vision seen in the omniscient Light,\nl
Some far tone of the immortal rhapsodist Voice,\nl
Some rapture of the all-creating Bliss,\nl
Some form and plan of the Beauty unutterable.\nl
Worlds are there nearer to those absolute realms,\nl
Where the response to Truth is swift and sure\nl
And spirit is not hampered by its frame\nl
And hearts by sharp division seized and rent\nl
And delight and beauty are inhabitants\nl
And love and sweetness are the law of life.\nl
A finer substance in a subtler mould\nl
Embodies the divinity earth but dreams;\nl
Its strength can overtake joy's running feet;\nl
Page 111

Overleaping the fixed hurdles set by Time,\nl
The rapid net of an intuitive clasp\nl
Captures the fugitive happiness we desire.\nl
A Nature lifted by a larger breath,\nl
Plastic and passive to the all-shaping Fire,\nl
Answers the flaming Godhead's casual touch:\nl
Immune from our inertia of response\nl
It hears the word to which our hearts are deaf,\nl
Adopts the seeing of immortal eyes\nl
And, traveller on the roads of line and hue,\nl
Pursues the spirit of beauty to its home.\nl
Thus we draw near to the All-Wonderful\nl
Following his rapture in things as sign and guide;\nl
Beauty is his footprint showing us where he has passed,\nl
Love is his heart-beats' rhythm in mortal breasts,\nl
Happiness the smile on his adorable face.\nl
A communion of spiritual entities,\nl
A genius of creative Immanence,\nl
Makes all creation deeply intimate:\nl
A fourth dimension of aesthetic sense\nl
Where all is in ourselves, ourselves in all,\nl
To the cosmic wideness re-aligns our souls.\nl
A kindling rapture joins the seer and seen;\nl
The craftsman and the craft grown inly one\nl
Achieve perfection by the magic throb\nl
And passion of their close identity.\nl
All that we slowly piece from gathered parts,\nl
Or by long labour stumblingly evolve,\nl
Is there self-born by its eternal right.\nl
In us too the intuitive Fire can burn;\nl
An agent Light, it is coiled in our folded hearts,\nl
On the celestial levels is its home:\nl
Descending, it can bring those heavens here.\nl
But rarely burns the flame nor burns for long;\nl
The joy it calls from those diviner heights\nl
Brings brief magnificent reminiscences\nl
Page 112

And high splendid glimpses of interpreting thought,\nl
But not the utter vision and delight.\nl
A veil is kept, something is still held back,\nl
Lest, captives of the beauty and the joy,\nl
Our souls forget to the Highest to aspire.\nl

\spar In that fair subtle realm behind our own\nl
The form is all, and physical gods are kings.\nl
The inspiring Light plays in fine boundaries;\nl
A faultless beauty comes by Nature's grace;\nl
There liberty is perfection's guarantee:\nl
Although the absolute Image lacks, the Word\nl
Incarnate, the sheer spiritual ecstasy,\nl
All is a miracle of symmetric charm,\nl
A fantasy of perfect line and rule.\nl
There all feel satisfied in themselves and whole,\nl
A rich completeness is by limit made,\nl
Marvel in an utter littleness abounds,\nl
An intricate rapture riots in a small space:\nl
Each rhythm is kin to its environment,\nl
Each line is perfect and inevitable,\nl
Each object faultlessly built for charm and use.\nl
All is enamoured of its own delight.\nl
Intact it lives of its perfection sure\nl
In a heaven-pleased self-glad immunity;\nl
Content to be, it has need of nothing more.\nl
Here was not futile effort's broken heart:\nl
Exempt from the ordeal and the test,\nl
Empty of opposition and of pain,\nl
It was a world that could not fear nor grieve.\nl
It had no grace of error or defeat,\nl
It had no room for fault, no power to fail.\nl
Out of some packed self-bliss it drew at once\nl
Its form-discoveries of the mute Idea\nl
And the miracle of its rhythmic thoughts and acts,\nl
Its clear technique of firm and rounded lives,\nl
Page 113

Its gracious people of inanimate shapes\nl
And glory of breathing bodies like our own.\nl
Amazed, his senses ravished with delight,\nl
He moved in a divine, yet kindred world\nl
Admiring marvellous forms so near to ours\nl
Yet perfect like the playthings of a god,\nl
Deathless in the aspect of mortality.\nl
In their narrow and exclusive absolutes\nl
The finite's ranked supremacies throned abide;\nl
It dreams not ever of what might have been;\nl
Only in boundaries can this absolute live.\nl
In a supremeness bound to its own plan\nl
Where all was finished and no widths were left,\nl
No space for shadows of the immeasurable,\nl
No room for the incalculable's surprise,\nl
A captive of its own beauty and ecstasy,\nl
In a magic circle wrought the enchanted Might.\nl
The spirit stood back effaced behind its frame.\nl
Admired for the bright finality of its lines\nl
A blue horizon limited the soul;\nl
Thought moved in luminous facilities,\nl
The outer ideal's shallows its swim-range:\nl
Life in its boundaries lingered satisfied\nl
With the small happiness of the body's acts.\nl
Assigned as Force to a bound corner-Mind,\nl
Attached to the safe paucity of her room,\nl
She did her little works and played and slept\nl
And thought not of a greater work undone.\nl
Forgetful of her violent vast desires,\nl
Forgetful of the heights to which she rose,\nl
Her walk was fixed within a radiant groove.\nl
The beautiful body of a soul at ease,\nl
Like one who laughs in sweet and sunlit groves,\nl
Childlike she swung in her gold cradle of joy.\nl
The spaces' call reached not her charmed abode,\nl
She had no wings for wide and dangerous flight,\nl
Page 114

She faced no peril of sky or of abyss,\nl
She knew no vistas and no mighty dreams,\nl
No yearning for her lost infinitudes.\nl
A perfect picture in a perfect frame,\nl
This faery artistry could not keep his will:\nl
Only a moment's fine release it gave;\nl
A careless hour was spent in a slight bliss.\nl
Our spirit tires of being's surfaces,\nl
Transcended is the splendour of the form;\nl
It turns to hidden powers and deeper states.\nl
So now he looked beyond for greater light.\nl
His soul's peak-climb abandoning in its rear\nl
This brilliant courtyard of the House of Days,\nl
He left that fine material Paradise.\nl
His destiny lay beyond in larger Space.\nl

\sbigcap An uneven broad ascent now lured his feet.\nl
Answering a greater Nature's troubled call\nl
He crossed the limits of embodied Mind\nl
And entered wide obscure disputed fields\nl
Where all was doubt and change and nothing sure,\nl
A world of search and toil without repose.\nl
As one who meets the face of the Unknown,\nl
A questioner with none to give reply,\nl
Attracted to a problem never solved,\nl
Always uncertain of the ground he trod,\nl
Always drawn on to an inconstant goal\nl
He travelled through a land peopled by doubts\nl
In shifting confines on a quaking base.\nl
In front he saw a boundary ever unreached\nl
And thought himself at each step nearer now,—\nl
A far retreating horizon of mirage.\nl
A vagrancy was there that brooked no home,\nl
A journey of countless paths without a close.\nl
Nothing he found to satisfy his heart;\nl
A tireless wandering sought and could not cease.\nl
There life is the manifest Incalculable,\nl
A movement of unquiet seas, a long\nl
And venturous leap of spirit into Space,\nl
A vexed disturbance in the eternal Calm,\nl
An impulse and passion of the Infinite.\nl
Assuming whatever shape her fancy wills,\nl
Escaped from the restraint of settled forms\nl
She has left the safety of the tried and known.\nl
Unshepherded by the fear that walks through Time,\nl
Undaunted by Fate that dogs and Chance that springs,\nl
She accepts disaster as a common risk;\nl
Page 116

Careless of suffering, heedless of sin and fall,\nl
She wrestles with danger and discovery\nl
In the unexplored expanses of the soul.\nl
To be seemed only a long experiment,\nl
The hazard of a seeking ignorant Force\nl
That tries all truths and, finding none supreme,\nl
Moves on unsatisfied, unsure of its end.\nl
As saw some inner mind, so life was shaped:\nl
From thought to thought she passed, from phase to phase,\nl
Tortured by her own powers or proud and blest,\nl
Now master of herself, now toy and slave.\nl
A huge inconsequence was her action's law,\nl
As if all possibility must be drained,\nl
And anguish and bliss were pastimes of the heart.\nl
In a gallop of thunder-hooved vicissitudes\nl
She swept through the race-fields of Circumstance,\nl
Or, swaying, she tossed between her heights and deeps,\nl
Uplifted or broken on Time's inconstant wheel.\nl
Amid a tedious crawl of drab desires\nl
She writhed, a worm mid worms in Nature's mud,\nl
Then, Titan-statured, took all earth for food,\nl
Ambitioned the seas for robe, for crown the stars\nl
And shouting strode from peak to giant peak,\nl
Clamouring for worlds to conquer and to rule.\nl
Then, wantonly enamoured of Sorrow's face,\nl
She plunged into the anguish of the depths\nl
And, wallowing, clung to her own misery.\nl
In dolorous converse with her squandered self\nl
She wrote the account of all that she had lost,\nl
Or sat with grief as with an ancient friend.\nl
A romp of violent raptures soon was spent,\nl
Or she lingered tied to an inadequate joy\nl
Missing the turns of fate, missing life's goal.\nl
A scene was planned for all her numberless moods\nl
Where each could be the law and way of life,\nl
But none could offer a pure felicity;\nl
Page 117

Only a flickering zest they left behind\nl
Or the fierce lust that brings a dead fatigue.\nl
Amid her swift untold variety\nl
Something remained dissatisfied, ever the same\nl
And in the new saw only a face of the old,\nl
For every hour repeated all the rest\nl
And every change prolonged the same unease.\nl
A spirit of her self and aim unsure,\nl
Tired soon of too much joy and happiness,\nl
She needs the spur of pleasure and of pain\nl
And the native taste of suffering and unrest:\nl
She strains for an end that never can she win.\nl
A perverse savour haunts her thirsting lips:\nl
For the grief she weeps which came from her own choice,\nl
For the pleasure yearns that racked with wounds her breast;\nl
Aspiring to heaven she turns her steps towards hell.\nl
Chance she has chosen and danger for playfellows;\nl
Fate's dreadful swing she has taken for cradle and seat.\nl
Yet pure and bright from the Timeless was her birth,\nl
A lost world-rapture lingers in her eyes,\nl
Her moods are faces of the Infinite:\nl
Beauty and happiness are her native right,\nl
And endless Bliss is her eternal home.\nl

\spar This now revealed its antique face of joy,\nl
A sudden disclosure to the heart of grief\nl
Tempting it to endure and long and hope.\nl
Even in changing worlds bereft of peace,\nl
In an air racked with sorrow and with fear\nl
And while his feet trod on a soil unsafe,\nl
He saw the image of a happier state.\nl
In an architecture of hieratic Space\nl
Circling and mounting towards creation's tops,\nl
At a blue height which never was too high\nl
For warm communion between body and soul,\nl
As far as heaven, as near as thought and hope,\nl
Page 118

Glimmered the kingdom of a griefless life.\nl
Above him in a new celestial vault\nl
Other than the heavens beheld by mortal eyes,\nl
As on a fretted ceiling of the gods,\nl
An archipelago of laughter and fire,\nl
Swam stars apart in a rippled sea of sky.\nl
Towered spirals, magic rings of vivid hue\nl
And gleaming spheres of strange felicity\nl
Floated through distance like a symbol world.\nl
On the trouble and the toil they could not share,\nl
On the unhappiness they could not aid,\nl
Impervious to life's suffering, struggle, grief,\nl
Untarnished by its anger, gloom and hate,\nl
Unmoved, untouched, looked down great visioned planes\nl
Blissful for ever in their timeless right.\nl
Absorbed in their own beauty and content,\nl
Of their immortal gladness they live sure.\nl
Apart in their self-glory plunged, remote\nl
Burning they swam in a vague lucent haze,\nl
An everlasting refuge of dream-light,\nl
A nebula of the splendours of the gods\nl
Made from the musings of eternity.\nl
Almost unbelievable by human faith,\nl
Hardly they seemed the stuff of things that are.\nl
As through a magic television's glass\nl
Outlined to some magnifying inner eye\nl
They shone like images thrown from a far scene\nl
Too high and glad for mortal lids to seize.\nl
But near and real to the longing heart\nl
And to the body's passionate thought and sense\nl
Are the hidden kingdoms of beatitude.\nl
In some close unattained realm which yet we feel,\nl
Immune from the harsh clutch of Death and Time,\nl
Escaping the search of sorrow and desire,\nl
In bright enchanted safe peripheries\nl
For ever wallowing in bliss they lie.\nl
Page 119

In dream and trance and muse before our eyes,\nl
Across a subtle vision's inner field,\nl
Wide rapturous landscapes fleeting from the sight,\nl
The figures of the perfect kingdom pass\nl
And behind them leave a shining memory's trail.\nl
Imagined scenes or great eternal worlds,\nl
Dream-caught or sensed, they touch our hearts with their depths;\nl
Unreal-seeming, yet more real than life,\nl
Happier than happiness, truer than things true,\nl
If dreams these were or captured images,\nl
Dream's truth made false earth's vain realities.\nl
In a swift eternal moment fixed there live\nl
Or ever recalled come back to longing eyes\nl
Calm heavens of imperishable Light,\nl
Illumined continents of violet peace,\nl
Oceans and rivers of the mirth of God\nl
And griefless countries under purple suns.\nl

\spar This, once a star of bright remote idea\nl
Or imagination's comet trail of dream,\nl
Took now a close shape of reality.\nl
The gulf between dream-truth, earth-fact was crossed,\nl
The wonder-worlds of life were dreams no more;\nl
His vision made all they unveiled its own:\nl
Their scenes, their happenings met his eyes and heart\nl
And smote them with pure loveliness and bliss.\nl
A breathless summit region drew his gaze\nl
Whose boundaries jutted into a sky of Self\nl
And dipped towards a strange ethereal base.\nl
The quintessence glowed of Life's supreme delight.\nl
On a spiritual and mysterious peak\nl
Only a miracle's high transfiguring line\nl
Divided life from the formless Infinite\nl
And sheltered Time against eternity.\nl
Out of that formless stuff Time mints his shapes;\nl
The Eternal's quiet holds the cosmic act:\nl
Page 120

The protean images of the World-Force\nl
Have drawn the strength to be, the will to last\nl
From a deep ocean of dynamic peace.\nl
Inverting the spirit's apex towards life,\nl
She spends the plastic liberties of the One\nl
To cast in acts the dreams of her caprice,\nl
His wisdom's call steadies her careless feet,\nl
He props her dance upon a rigid base,\nl
His timeless still immutability\nl
Must standardise her creation's miracle.\nl
Out of the Void's unseeing energies\nl
Inventing the scene of a concrete universe,\nl
By his thought she has fixed its paces, in its blind acts\nl
She sees by flashes of his all-knowing Light.\nl
At her will the inscrutable Supermind leans down\nl
To guide her force that feels but cannot know,\nl
Its breath of power controls her restless seas\nl
And life obeys the governing Idea.\nl
At her will, led by a luminous Immanence\nl
The hazardous experimenting Mind\nl
Pushes its way through obscure possibles\nl
Mid chance formations of an unknowing world.\nl
Our human ignorance moves towards the Truth\nl
That Nescience may become omniscient,\nl
Transmuted instincts shape to divine thoughts,\nl
Thoughts house infallible immortal sight\nl
And Nature climb towards God's identity.\nl
The Master of the worlds self-made her slave\nl
Is the executor of her fantasies:\nl
She has canalised the seas of omnipotence;\nl
She has limited by her laws the Illimitable.\nl
The Immortal bound himself to do her works;\nl
He labours at the tasks her Ignorance sets,\nl
Hidden in the cape of our mortality.\nl
The worlds, the forms her goddess fancy makes\nl
Have lost their origin on unseen heights:\nl
Page 121

Even severed, straying from their timeless source,\nl
Even deformed, obscure, accursed and fallen,—\nl
Since even fall has its perverted joy\nl
And nothing she leaves out that serves delight,—\nl
These too can to the peaks revert or here\nl
Cut out the sentence of the spirit's fall,\nl
Recover their forfeited divinity.\nl
At once caught in an eternal vision's sweep\nl
He saw her pride and splendour of highborn zones\nl
And her regions crouching in the nether deeps.\nl
Above was a monarchy of unfallen self,\nl
Beneath was the gloomy trance of the abyss,\nl
An opposite pole or dim antipodes.\nl
There were vasts of the glory of life's absolutes:\nl
All laughed in a safe immortality\nl
And an eternal childhood of the soul\nl
Before darkness came and pain and grief were born\nl
Where all could dare to be themselves and one\nl
And Wisdom played in sinless innocence\nl
With naked Freedom in Truth's happy sun.\nl
There were worlds of her laughter and dreadful irony,\nl
There were fields of her taste of toil and strife and tears;\nl
Her head lay on the breast of amorous Death,\nl
Sleep imitated awhile extinction's peace.\nl
The light of God she has parted from his dark\nl
To test the savour of bare opposites.\nl
Here mingling in man's heart their tones and hues\nl
Have woven his being's mutable design,\nl
His life a forward-rippling stream in Time,\nl
His nature's constant fixed mobility,\nl
His soul a moving picture's changeful film,\nl
His cosmos-chaos of personality.\nl
The grand creatrix with her cryptic touch\nl
Has turned to pathos and power being's self-dream,\nl
Made a passion-play of its fathomless mystery.\nl
Page 122

\spar But here were worlds lifted half-way to heaven.\nl
The Veil was there but not the Shadowy Wall;\nl
In forms not too remote from human grasp\nl
Some passion of the inviolate purity\nl
Broke through, a ray of the original Bliss.\nl
Heaven's joys might have been earth's if earth were pure.\nl
There could have reached our divinised sense and heart\nl
Some natural felicity's bright extreme,\nl
Some thrill of Supernature's absolutes:\nl
All strengths could laugh and sport on earth's hard roads\nl
And never feel her cruel edge of pain,\nl
All love could play and nowhere Nature's shame.\nl
But she has stabled her dreams in Matter's courts\nl
And still her doors are barred to things supreme.\nl
These worlds could feel God's breath visiting their tops;\nl
Some glimmer of the Transcendent's hem was there.\nl
Across the white aeonic silences\nl
Immortal figures of embodied joy\nl
Traversed wide spaces near to eternity's sleep.\nl
Pure mystic voices in beatitude's hush\nl
Appealed to Love's immaculate sweetnesses,\nl
Calling his honeyed touch to thrill the worlds,\nl
His blissful hands to seize on Nature's limbs,\nl
His sweet intolerant might of union\nl
To take all beings into his saviour arms,\nl
Drawing to his pity the rebel and the waif\nl
To force on them the happiness they refuse.\nl
A chant hymeneal to the unseen Divine,\nl
A flaming rhapsody of white desire\nl
Lured an immortal music into the heart\nl
And woke the slumbering ear of ecstasy.\nl
A purer, fierier sense had there its home,\nl
A burning urge no earthly limbs can hold;\nl
One drew a large unburdened spacious breath\nl
And the heart sped from beat to rapturous beat.\nl
The voice of Time sang of the Immortal's joy;\nl
Page 123

An inspiration and a lyric cry,\nl
The moments came with ecstasy on their wings;\nl
Beauty unimaginable moved heaven-bare\nl
Absolved from boundaries in the vasts of dream;\nl
The cry of the Birds of Wonder called from the skies\nl
To the deathless people of the shores of Light.\nl
Creation leaped straight from the hands of God;\nl
Marvel and rapture wandered in the ways.\nl
Only to be was a supreme delight,\nl
Life was a happy laughter of the soul\nl
And Joy was king with Love for minister.\nl
The spirit's luminousness was bodied there.\nl
Life's contraries were lovers or natural friends\nl
And her extremes keen edges of harmony:\nl
Indulgence with a tender purity came\nl
And nursed the god on her maternal breast:\nl
There none was weak, so falsehood could not live;\nl
Ignorance was a thin shade protecting light,\nl
Imagination the free-will of Truth,\nl
Pleasure a candidate for heaven's fire;\nl
The intellect was Beauty's worshipper,\nl
Strength was the slave of calm spiritual law,\nl
Power laid its head upon the breasts of Bliss.\nl
There were summit-glories inconceivable,\nl
Autonomies of Wisdom's still self-rule\nl
And high dependencies of her virgin sun,\nl
Illumined theocracies of the seeing soul\nl
Throned in the power of the Transcendent's ray.\nl
A vision of grandeurs, a dream of magnitudes\nl
In sun-bright kingdoms moved with regal gait:\nl
Assemblies, crowded senates of the gods,\nl
Life's puissances reigned on seats of marble will,\nl
High dominations and autocracies\nl
And laurelled strengths and armed imperative mights.\nl
All objects there were great and beautiful,\nl
All beings wore a royal stamp of power.\nl
Page 124

There sat the oligarchies of natural Law,\nl
Proud violent heads served one calm monarch brow:\nl
All the soul's postures donned divinity.\nl
There met the ardent mutual intimacies\nl
Of mastery's joy and the joy of servitude\nl
Imposed by Love on Love's heart that obeys\nl
And Love's body held beneath a rapturous yoke.\nl
All was a game of meeting kinglinesses.\nl
For worship lifts the worshipper's bowed strength\nl
Close to the god's pride and bliss his soul adores:\nl
The ruler there is one with all he rules;\nl
To him who serves with a free equal heart\nl
Obedience is his princely training's school,\nl
His nobility's coronet and privilege,\nl
His faith is a high nature's idiom,\nl
His service a spiritual sovereignty.\nl
There were realms where Knowledge joined creative Power\nl
In her high home and made her all his own:\nl
The grand Illuminate seized her gleaming limbs\nl
And filled them with the passion of his ray\nl
Till all her body was its transparent house\nl
And all her soul a counterpart of his soul.\nl
Apotheosised, transfigured by wisdom's touch,\nl
Her days became a luminous sacrifice;\nl
An immortal moth in happy and endless fire,\nl
She burned in his sweet intolerable blaze.\nl
A captive Life wedded her conqueror.\nl
In his wide sky she built her world anew;\nl
She gave to mind's calm pace the motor's speed,\nl
To thinking a need to live what the soul saw,\nl
To living an impetus to know and see.\nl
His splendour grasped her, her puissance to him clung;\nl
She crowned the Idea a king in purple robes,\nl
Put her magic serpent sceptre in Thought's grip,\nl
Made forms his inward vision's rhythmic shapes\nl
And her acts the living body of his will.\nl
Page 125

A flaming thunder, a creator flash,\nl
His victor Light rode on her deathless Force;\nl
A centaur's mighty gallop bore the god.\nl
Life throned with mind, a double majesty.\nl
Worlds were there of a happiness great and grave\nl
And action tinged with dream, laughter with thought,\nl
And passion there could wait for its desire\nl
Until it heard the near approach of God.\nl
Worlds were there of a childlike mirth and joy;\nl
A carefree youthfulness of mind and heart\nl
Found in the body a heavenly instrument;\nl
It lit an aureate halo round desire\nl
And freed the deified animal in the limbs\nl
To divine gambols of love and beauty and bliss.\nl
On a radiant soil that gazed at heaven's smile\nl
A swift life-impulse stinted not nor stopped:\nl
It knew not how to tire; happy were its tears.\nl
There work was play and play the only work,\nl
The tasks of heaven a game of godlike might:\nl
A celestial bacchanal for ever pure,\nl
Unstayed by faintness as in mortal frames\nl
Life was an eternity of rapture's moods:\nl
Age never came, care never lined the face.\nl
Imposing on the safety of the stars\nl
A race and laughter of immortal strengths,\nl
The nude god-children in their play-fields ran\nl
Smiting the winds with splendour and with speed;\nl
Of storm and sun they made companions,\nl
Sported with the white mane of tossing seas,\nl
Slew distance trampled to death under their wheels\nl
And wrestled in the arenas of their force.\nl
Imperious in their radiance like the suns\nl
They kindled heaven with the glory of their limbs\nl
Flung like a divine largess to the world.\nl
A spell to force the heart to stark delight,\nl
They carried the pride and mastery of their charm\nl
Page 126

As if Life's banner on the roads of Space.\nl
Ideas were luminous comrades of the soul;\nl
Mind played with speech, cast javelins of thought,\nl
But needed not these instruments' toil to know;\nl
Knowledge was Nature's pastime like the rest.\nl
Investitured with the fresh heart's bright ray,\nl
An early God-instinct's child inheritors,\nl
Tenants of the perpetuity of Time\nl
Still thrilling with the first creation's bliss,\nl
They steeped existence in their youth of soul.\nl
An exquisite and vehement tyranny,\nl
The strong compulsion of their will to joy\nl
Poured smiling streams of happiness through the world.\nl
There reigned a breath of high immune content,\nl
A fortunate gait of days in tranquil air,\nl
A flood of universal love and peace.\nl
A sovereignty of tireless sweetness lived\nl
Like a song of pleasure on the lips of Time.\nl
A large spontaneous order freed the will,\nl
A sun-frank winging of the soul to bliss,\nl
The breadth and greatness of the unfettered act\nl
And the swift fire-heart's golden liberty.\nl
There was no falsehood of soul-severance,\nl
There came no crookedness of thought or word\nl
To rob creation of its native truth;\nl
All was sincerity and natural force.\nl
There freedom was sole rule and highest law.\nl
In a happy series climbed or plunged these worlds:\nl
In realms of curious beauty and surprise,\nl
In fields of grandeur and of titan power,\nl
Life played at ease with her immense desires.\nl
A thousand Edens she could build nor pause;\nl
No bound was set to her greatness and to her grace\nl
And to her heavenly variety.\nl
Awake with a cry and stir of numberless souls,\nl
Arisen from the breast of some deep Infinite,\nl
Page 127

Smiling like a new-born child at love and hope,\nl
In her nature housing the Immortal's power,\nl
In her bosom bearing the eternal Will,\nl
No guide she needed but her luminous heart:\nl
No fall debased the godhead of her steps,\nl
No alien Night had come to blind her eyes.\nl
There was no use for grudging ring or fence;\nl
Each act was a perfection and a joy.\nl
Abandoned to her rapid fancy's moods\nl
And the rich coloured riot of her mind,\nl
Initiate of divine and mighty dreams,\nl
Magician builder of unnumbered forms\nl
Exploring the measures of the rhythms of God,\nl
At will she wove her wizard wonder-dance,\nl
A Dionysian goddess of delight,\nl
A Bacchant of creative ecstasy.\nl

\spar This world of bliss he saw and felt its call,\nl
But found no way to enter into its joy;\nl
Across the conscious gulf there was no bridge.\nl
A darker air encircled still his soul\nl
Tied to an image of unquiet life.\nl
In spite of yearning mind and longing sense,\nl
To a sad Thought by grey experience formed\nl
And a vision dimmed by care and sorrow and sleep\nl
All this seemed only a bright desirable dream\nl
Conceived in a longing distance by the heart\nl
Of one who walks in the shadow of earth-pain.\nl
Although he once had felt the Eternal's clasp,\nl
Too near to suffering worlds his nature lived,\nl
And where he stood were entrances of Night.\nl
Hardly, too close beset by the world's care,\nl
Can the dense mould in which we have been made\nl
Return sheer joy to joy, pure light to light.\nl
For its tormented will to think and live\nl
First to a mingled pain and pleasure woke\nl
Page 128

And still it keeps the habit of its birth:\nl
A dire duality is our way to be.\nl
In the crude beginnings of this mortal world\nl
Life was not nor mind's play nor heart's desire.\nl
When earth was built in the unconscious Void\nl
And nothing was save a material scene,\nl
Identified with sea and sky and stone\nl
Her young gods yearned for the release of souls\nl
Asleep in objects, vague, inanimate.\nl
In that desolate grandeur, in that beauty bare,\nl
In the deaf stillness, mid the unheeded sounds,\nl
Heavy was the uncommunicated load\nl
Of Godhead in a world that had no needs;\nl
For none was there to feel or to receive.\nl
This solid mass which brooked no throb of sense\nl
Could not contain their vast creative urge:\nl
Immersed no more in Matter's harmony,\nl
The Spirit lost its statuesque repose.\nl
In the uncaring trance it groped for sight,\nl
Passioned for the movements of a conscious heart,\nl
Famishing for speech and thought and joy and love,\nl
In the dumb insensitive wheeling day and night\nl
Hungered for the beat of yearning and response.\nl
The poised inconscience shaken with a touch,\nl
The intuitive Silence trembling with a name,\nl
They cried to Life to invade the senseless mould\nl
And in brute forms awake divinity.\nl
A voice was heard on the mute rolling globe,\nl
A murmur moaned in the unlistening Void.\nl
A being seemed to breathe where once was none:\nl
Something pent up in dead insentient depths,\nl
Denied conscious existence, lost to joy,\nl
Turned as if one asleep since dateless time.\nl
Aware of its own buried reality,\nl
Remembering its forgotten self and right,\nl
It yearned to know, to aspire, to enjoy, to live.\nl
Page 129

Life heard the call and left her native light.\nl
Overflowing from her bright magnificent plane\nl
On the rigid coil and sprawl of mortal Space,\nl
Here too the gracious great-winged Angel poured\nl
Her splendour and her swiftness and her bliss,\nl
Hoping to fill a fair new world with joy.\nl
As comes a goddess to a mortal's breast\nl
And fills his days with her celestial clasp,\nl
She stooped to make her home in transient shapes;\nl
In Matter's womb she cast the Immortal's fire,\nl
In the unfeeling Vast woke thought and hope,\nl
Smote with her charm and beauty flesh and nerve\nl
And forced delight on earth's insensible frame.\nl
Alive and clad with trees and herbs and flowers\nl
Earth's great brown body smiled towards the skies,\nl
Azure replied to azure in the sea's laugh;\nl
New sentient creatures filled the unseen depths,\nl
Life's glory and swiftness ran in the beauty of beasts,\nl
Man dared and thought and met with his soul the world.\nl
But while the magic breath was on its way,\nl
Before her gifts could reach our prisoned hearts,\nl
A dark ambiguous Presence questioned all.\nl
The secret Will that robes itself with Night\nl
And offers to spirit the ordeal of the flesh,\nl
Imposed a mystic mask of death and pain.\nl
Interned now in the slow and suffering years\nl
Sojourns the winged and wonderful wayfarer\nl
And can no more recall her happier state,\nl
But must obey the inert Inconscient's law,\nl
Insensible foundation of a world\nl
In which blind limits are on beauty laid\nl
And sorrow and joy as struggling comrades live.\nl
A dim and dreadful muteness fell on her:\nl
Abolished was her subtle mighty spirit\nl
And slain her boon of child-god happiness,\nl
And all her glory into littleness turned\nl
Page 130

And all her sweetness into a maimed desire.\nl
To feed death with her works is here life's doom.\nl
So veiled was her immortality that she seemed,\nl
Inflicting consciousness on unconscious things,\nl
An episode in an eternal death,\nl
A myth of being that must for ever cease.\nl
Such was the evil mystery of her change.\nl

\sbigcap A quivering trepidant uncertain world\nl
Born from that dolorous meeting and eclipse\nl
Appeared in the emptiness where her feet had trod,\nl
A quick obscurity, a seeking stir.\nl
There was a writhing of half-conscious force\nl
Hardly awakened from the Inconscient's sleep,\nl
Tied to an instinct-driven Ignorance,\nl
To find itself and find its hold on things.\nl
Inheritor of poverty and loss,\nl
Assailed by memories that fled when seized,\nl
Haunted by a forgotten uplifting hope,\nl
It strove with a blindness as of groping hands\nl
To fill the aching and disastrous gap\nl
Between earth-pain and the bliss from which Life fell.\nl
A world that ever seeks for something missed,\nl
Hunts for the joy that earth has failed to keep.\nl
Too near to our gates its unappeased unrest\nl
For peace to live on the inert solid globe:\nl
It has joined its hunger to the hunger of earth,\nl
It has given the law of craving to our lives,\nl
It has made our spirit's need a fathomless gulf.\nl
An Influence entered mortal night and day,\nl
A shadow overcast the time-born race;\nl
In the troubled stream where leaps a blind heart-pulse\nl
And the nerve-beat of feeling wakes in sense\nl
Dividing Matter's sleep from conscious Mind,\nl
There strayed a call that knew not why it came.\nl
A Power beyond earth's scope has touched the earth;\nl
The repose that might have been can be no more;\nl
A formless yearning passions in man's heart,\nl
A cry is in his blood for happier things:\nl
Page 132

Else could he roam on a free sunlit soil\nl
With the childlike pain-forgetting mind of beasts\nl
Or live happy, unmoved, like flowers and trees.\nl
The Might that came upon the earth to bless,\nl
Has stayed on earth to suffer and aspire.\nl
The infant laugh that rang through time is hushed:\nl
Man's natural joy of life is overcast\nl
And sorrow is his nurse of destiny.\nl
The animal's thoughtless joy is left behind,\nl
Care and reflection burden his daily walk;\nl
He has risen to greatness and to discontent,\nl
He is awake to the Invisible.\nl
Insatiate seeker, he has all to learn:\nl
He has exhausted now life's surface acts,\nl
His being's hidden realms remain to explore.\nl
He becomes a mind, he becomes a spirit and self;\nl
In his fragile tenement he grows Nature's lord.\nl
In him Matter wakes from its long obscure trance,\nl
In him earth feels the Godhead drawing near.\nl
An eyeless Power that sees no more its aim,\nl
A restless hungry energy of Will,\nl
Life cast her seed in the body's indolent mould;\nl
It woke from happy torpor a blind Force\nl
Compelling it to sense and seek and feel.\nl
In the enormous labour of the Void\nl
Perturbing with her dreams the vast routine\nl
And dead roll of a slumbering universe\nl
The mighty prisoner struggled for release.\nl
Alive with her yearning woke the inert cell,\nl
In the heart she kindled a fire of passion and need,\nl
Amid the deep calm of inanimate things\nl
Arose her great voice of toil and prayer and strife.\nl
A groping consciousness in a voiceless world,\nl
A guideless sense was given her for her road;\nl
Thought was withheld and nothing now she knew,\nl
But all the unknown was hers to feel and clasp.\nl
Page 133

Obeying the push of unborn things towards birth\nl
Out of her seal of insentient life she broke:\nl
In her substance of unthinking mute soul-strength\nl
That cannot utter what its depths divine,\nl
Awoke a blind necessity to know.\nl
The chain that bound her she made her instrument;\nl
Instinct was hers, the chrysalis of Truth,\nl
And effort and growth and striving nescience.\nl
Inflicting on the body desire and hope,\nl
Imposing on inconscience consciousness,\nl
She brought into Matter's dull tenacity\nl
Her anguished claim to her lost sovereign right,\nl
Her tireless search, her vexed uneasy heart,\nl
Her wandering unsure steps, her cry for change.\nl
Adorer of a joy without a name,\nl
In her obscure cathedral of delight\nl
To dim dwarf gods she offers secret rites.\nl
But vain unending is the sacrifice,\nl
The priest an ignorant mage who only makes\nl
Futile mutations in the altar's plan\nl
And casts blind hopes into a powerless flame.\nl
A burden of transient gains weighs down her steps\nl
And hardly under that load can she advance;\nl
But the hours cry to her, she travels on\nl
Passing from thought to thought, from want to want;\nl
Her greatest progress is a deepened need.\nl
Matter dissatisfies, she turns to Mind;\nl
She conquers earth, her field, then claims the heavens.\nl
Insensible, breaking the work she has done\nl
The stumbling ages over her labour pass,\nl
But still no great transforming light came down\nl
And no revealing rapture touched her fall.\nl
Only a glimmer sometimes splits mind's sky\nl
Justifying the ambiguous providence\nl
That makes of night a path to unknown dawns\nl
Or a dark clue to some diviner state.\nl
Page 134

In Nescience began her mighty task,\nl
In Ignorance she pursues the unfinished work,\nl
For knowledge gropes, but meets not Wisdom's face.\nl
Ascending slowly with unconscious steps,\nl
A foundling of the Gods she wanders here\nl
Like a child-soul left near the gates of Hell\nl
Fumbling through fog in search of Paradise.\nl

\spar In this slow ascension he must follow her pace\nl
Even from her faint and dim subconscious start:\nl
So only can earth's last salvation come.\nl
For so only could he know the obscure cause\nl
Of all that holds us back and baffles God\nl
In the jail-delivery of the imprisoned soul.\nl
Along swift paths of fall through dangerous gates\nl
He chanced into a grey obscurity\nl
Teeming with instincts from the mindless gulfs\nl
That pushed to wear a form and win a place.\nl
Life here was intimate with Death and Night\nl
And ate Death's food that she might breathe awhile;\nl
She was their inmate and adopted waif.\nl
Accepting subconscience, in dumb darkness' reign\nl
A sojourner, she hoped not any more.\nl
There far away from Truth and luminous thought\nl
He saw the original seat, the separate birth\nl
Of the dethroned, deformed and suffering Power.\nl
An unhappy face of falsity made true,\nl
A contradiction of our divine birth,\nl
Indifferent to beauty and to light,\nl
Parading she flaunted her animal disgrace\nl
Unhelped by camouflage, brutal and bare,\nl
An authentic image recognised and signed\nl
Of her outcast force exiled from heaven and hope,\nl
Fallen, glorying in the vileness of her state,\nl
The grovel of a strength once half divine,\nl
The graceless squalor of her beast desires,\nl
Page 135

The staring visage of her ignorance,\nl
The naked body of her poverty.\nl
Here first she crawled out from her cabin of mud\nl
Where she had lain inconscient, rigid, mute:\nl
Its narrowness and torpor held her still,\nl
A darkness clung to her uneffaced by Light.\nl
There neared no touch redeeming from above:\nl
The upward look was alien to her sight,\nl
Forgotten the fearless godhead of her walk;\nl
Renounced was the glory and felicity,\nl
The adventure in the dangerous fields of Time:\nl
Hardly she availed, wallowing, to bear and live.\nl

\spar A wide unquiet mist of seeking Space,\nl
A rayless region swallowed in vague swathes,\nl
That seemed, unnamed, unbodied and unhoused,\nl
A swaddled visionless and formless mind,\nl
Asked for a body to translate its soul.\nl
Its prayer denied, it fumbled after thought.\nl
As yet not powered to think, hardly to live,\nl
It opened into a weird and pigmy world\nl
Where this unhappy magic had its source.\nl
On dim confines where Life and Matter meet\nl
He wandered among things half-seen, half-guessed,\nl
Pursued by ungrasped beginnings and lost ends.\nl
There life was born but died before it could live.\nl
There was no solid ground, no constant drift;\nl
Only some flame of mindless Will had power.\nl
Himself was dim to himself, half-felt, obscure,\nl
As if in a struggle of the Void to be.\nl
In strange domains where all was living sense\nl
But mastering thought was not nor cause nor rule,\nl
Only a crude child-heart cried for toys of bliss,\nl
Mind flickered, a disordered infant glow,\nl
And random shapeless energies drove towards form\nl
And took each wisp-fire for a guiding sun.\nl
Page 136

This blindfold force could place no thinking step;\nl
Asking for light she followed darkness' clue.\nl
An inconscient Power groped towards consciousness,\nl
Matter smitten by Matter glimmered to sense,\nl
Blind contacts, slow reactions beat out sparks\nl
Of instinct from a cloaked subliminal bed,\nl
Sensations crowded, dumb substitutes for thought,\nl
Perception answered Nature's wakening blows\nl
But still was a mechanical response,\nl
A jerk, a leap, a start in Nature's dream,\nl
And rude unchastened impulses jostling ran\nl
Heedless of every motion but their own\nl
And, darkling, clashed with darker than themselves,\nl
Free in a world of settled anarchy.\nl
The need to exist, the instinct to survive\nl
Engrossed the tense precarious moment's will\nl
And an unseeing desire felt out for food.\nl
The gusts of Nature were the only law,\nl
Force wrestled with force, but no result remained:\nl
Only were achieved a nescient grasp and drive\nl
And feelings and instincts knowing not their source,\nl
Sense-pleasures and sense-pangs soon caught, soon lost,\nl
And the brute motion of unthinking lives.\nl
It was a vain unnecessary world\nl
Whose will to be brought poor and sad results\nl
And meaningless suffering and a grey unease.\nl
Nothing seemed worth the labour to become.\nl

\spar But judged not so his spirit's wakened eye.\nl
As shines a solitary witness star\nl
That burns apart, Light's lonely sentinel,\nl
In the drift and teeming of a mindless Night,\nl
A single thinker in an aimless world\nl
Awaiting some tremendous dawn of God,\nl
He saw the purpose in the works of Time.\nl
Even in that aimlessness a work was done\nl
Page 137

Pregnant with magic will and change divine.\nl
The first writhings of the cosmic serpent Force\nl
Uncoiled from the mystic ring of Matter's trance;\nl
It raised its head in the warm air of life.\nl
It could not cast off yet Night's stiffening sleep\nl
Or wear as yet mind's wonder-flecks and streaks,\nl
Put on its jewelled hood the crown of soul\nl
Or stand erect in the blaze of spirit's sun.\nl
As yet were only seen foulness and force,\nl
The secret crawl of consciousness to light\nl
Through a fertile slime of lust and battening sense,\nl
Beneath the body's crust of thickened self\nl
A tardy fervent working in the dark,\nl
The turbid yeast of Nature's passionate change,\nl
Ferment of the soul's creation out of mire.\nl
A heavenly process donned this grey disguise,\nl
A fallen ignorance in its covert night\nl
Laboured to achieve its dumb unseemly work,\nl
A camouflage of the Inconscient's need\nl
To release the glory of God in Nature's mud.\nl
His sight, spiritual in embodying orbs,\nl
Could pierce through the grey phosphorescent haze\nl
And scan the secrets of the shifting flux\nl
That animates these mute and solid cells\nl
And leads the thought and longing of the flesh\nl
And the keen lust and hunger of its will.\nl
This too he tracked along its hidden stream\nl
And traced its acts to a miraculous fount.\nl
A mystic Presence none can probe nor rule,\nl
Creator of this game of ray and shade\nl
In this sweet and bitter paradoxical life,\nl
Asks from the body the soul's intimacies\nl
And by the swift vibration of a nerve\nl
Links its mechanic throbs to light and love.\nl
It summons the spirit's sleeping memories\nl
Up from subconscient depths beneath Time's foam;\nl
Page 138

Oblivious of their flame of happy truth,\nl
Arriving with heavy eyes that hardly see,\nl
They come disguised as feelings and desires,\nl
Like weeds upon the surface float awhile\nl
And rise and sink on a somnambulist tide.\nl
Impure, degraded though her motions are,\nl
Always a heaven-truth broods in life's deeps;\nl
In her obscurest members burns that fire.\nl
A touch of God's rapture in creation's acts,\nl
A lost remembrance of felicity\nl
Lurks still in the dumb roots of death and birth,\nl
The world's senseless beauty mirrors God's delight.\nl
That rapture's smile is secret everywhere;\nl
It flows in the wind's breath, in the tree's sap,\nl
Its hued magnificence blooms in leaves and flowers.\nl
When life broke through its half-drowse in the plant\nl
That feels and suffers but cannot move or cry,\nl
In beast and in winged bird and thinking man\nl
It made of the heart's rhythm its music's beat;\nl
It forced the unconscious tissues to awake\nl
And ask for happiness and earn the pang\nl
And thrill with pleasure and laughter of brief delight,\nl
And quiver with pain and crave for ecstasy.\nl
Imperative, voiceless, ill-understood,\nl
Too far from light, too close to being's core,\nl
Born strangely in Time from the eternal Bliss,\nl
It presses on heart's core and vibrant nerve;\nl
Its sharp self-seeking tears our consciousness;\nl
Our pain and pleasure have that sting for cause:\nl
Instinct with it, but blind to its true joy\nl
The soul's desire leaps out towards passing things.\nl
All Nature's longing drive none can resist,\nl
Comes surging through the blood and quickened sense;\nl
An ecstasy of the infinite is her cause.\nl
It turns in us to finite loves and lusts,\nl
The will to conquer and have, to seize and keep,\nl
Page 139

To enlarge life's room and scope and pleasure's range,\nl
To battle and overcome and make one's own,\nl
The hope to mix one's joy with others' joy,\nl
A yearning to possess and be possessed,\nl
To enjoy and be enjoyed, to feel, to live.\nl
Here was its early brief attempt to be,\nl
Its rapid end of momentary delight\nl
Whose stamp of failure haunts all ignorant life.\nl
Inflicting still its habit on the cells\nl
The phantom of a dark and evil start\nl
Ghostlike pursues all that we dream and do.\nl
Although on earth are firm established lives,\nl
A working of habit or a sense of law,\nl
A steady repetition in the flux,\nl
Yet are its roots of will ever the same;\nl
These passions are the stuff of which we are made.\nl
This was the first cry of the awaking world.\nl
It clings around us still and clamps the god.\nl
Even when reason is born and soul takes form,\nl
In beast and reptile and in thinking man\nl
It lasts and is the fount of all their life.\nl
This too was needed that breath and living might be.\nl
The spirit in a finite ignorant world\nl
Must rescue so its prisoned consciousness\nl
Forced out in little jets at quivering points\nl
From the Inconscient's sealed infinitude.\nl
Then slowly it gathers mass, looks up at Light.\nl
This Nature lives tied to her origin,\nl
A clutch of nether force is on her still;\nl
Out of unconscious depths her instincts leap;\nl
A neighbour is her life to insentient Nought.\nl
Under this law an ignorant world was made.\nl
\sparn In the enigma of the darkened Vasts,\nl
In the passion and self-loss of the Infinite\nl
When all was plunged in the negating Void,\nl
Non-Being's night could never have been saved\nl
Page 140

If Being had not plunged into the dark\nl
Carrying with it its triple mystic cross.\nl
Invoking in world-time the timeless truth,\nl
Bliss changed to sorrow, knowledge made ignorant,\nl
God's force turned into a child's helplessness\nl
Can bring down heaven by their sacrifice.\nl
A contradiction founds the base of life:\nl
The eternal, the divine Reality\nl
Has faced itself with its own contraries;\nl
Being became the Void and Conscious-Force\nl
Nescience and walk of a blind Energy\nl
And Ecstasy took the figure of world-pain.\nl
In a mysterious dispensation's law\nl
A Wisdom that prepares its far-off ends\nl
Planned so to start her slow aeonic game.\nl
A blindfold search and wrestle and fumbling clasp\nl
Of a half-seen Nature and a hidden Soul,\nl
A game of hide-and-seek in twilit rooms,\nl
A play of love and hate and fear and hope\nl
Continues in the nursery of mind\nl
Its hard and heavy romp of self-born twins.\nl
At last the struggling Energy can emerge\nl
And meet the voiceless Being in wider fields;\nl
Then can they see and speak and, breast to breast,\nl
In a larger consciousness, a clearer light,\nl
The Two embrace and strive and each know each\nl
Regarding closer now the playmate's face.\nl
Even in these formless coilings he could feel\nl
Matter's response to an infant stir of soul.\nl
In Nature he saw the mighty Spirit concealed,\nl
Watched the weak birth of a tremendous Force,\nl
Pursued the riddle of Godhead's tentative pace,\nl
Heard the faint rhythms of a great unborn Muse.\nl

\spar Then came a fierier breath of waking Life,\nl
And there arose from the dim gulf of things\nl
Page 141

The strange creations of a thinking sense,\nl
Existences half-real and half-dream.\nl
A life was there that hoped not to survive:\nl
Beings were born who perished without trace,\nl
Events that were a formless drama's limbs\nl
And actions driven by a blind creature will.\nl
A seeking Power found out its road to form,\nl
Patterns were built of love and joy and pain\nl
And symbol figures for the moods of Life.\nl
An insect hedonism fluttered and crawled\nl
And basked in a sunlit Nature's surface thrills,\nl
And dragon raptures, python agonies\nl
Crawled in the marsh and mire and licked the sun.\nl
Huge armoured strengths shook a frail quaking ground,\nl
Great puissant creatures with a dwarfish brain,\nl
And pigmy tribes imposed their small life-drift.\nl
In a dwarf model of humanity\nl
Nature now launched the extreme experience\nl
And master-point of her design's caprice,\nl
Luminous result of her half-conscious climb\nl
On rungs twixt her sublimities and grotesques\nl
To massive from infinitesimal shapes,\nl
To a subtle balancing of body and soul,\nl
To an order of intelligent littleness.\nl
Around him in the moment-beats of Time\nl
The kingdom of the animal self arose,\nl
Where deed is all and mind is still half-born\nl
And the heart obeys a dumb unseen control.\nl
The Force that works by the light of Ignorance,\nl
Her animal experiment began,\nl
Crowding with conscious creatures her world-scheme;\nl
But to the outward only were they alive,\nl
Only they replied to touches and surfaces\nl
And to the prick of need that drove their lives.\nl
A body that knew not its own soul within,\nl
There lived and longed, had wrath and joy and grief;\nl
Page 142

A mind was there that met the objective world\nl
As if a stranger or enemy at its door:\nl
Its thoughts were kneaded by the shocks of sense;\nl
It captured not the spirit in the form,\nl
It entered not the heart of what it saw;\nl
It looked not for the power behind the act,\nl
It studied not the hidden motive in things\nl
Nor strove to find the meaning of it all.\nl
Beings were there who wore a human form;\nl
Absorbed they lived in the passion of the scene,\nl
But knew not who they were or why they lived:\nl
Content to breathe, to feel, to sense, to act,\nl
Life had for them no aim save Nature's joy\nl
And the stimulus and delight of outer things;\nl
Identified with the spirit's outward shell,\nl
They worked for the body's wants, they craved no more.\nl
The veiled spectator watching from their depths\nl
Fixed not his inward eye upon himself\nl
Nor turned to find the author of the plot,\nl
He saw the drama only and the stage.\nl
There was no brooding stress of deeper sense,\nl
The burden of reflection was not borne:\nl
Mind looked on Nature with unknowing eyes,\nl
Adored her boons and feared her monstrous strokes.\nl
It pondered not on the magic of her laws,\nl
It thirsted not for the secret wells of Truth,\nl
But made a register of crowding facts\nl
And strung sensations on a vivid thread:\nl
It hunted and it fled and sniffed the winds,\nl
Or slothed inert in sunshine and soft air:\nl
It sought the engrossing contacts of the world,\nl
But only to feed the surface sense with bliss.\nl
These felt life's quiver in the outward touch,\nl
They could not feel behind the touch the soul.\nl
To guard their form of self from Nature's harm,\nl
To enjoy and to survive was all their care.\nl
Page 143

The narrow horizon of their days was filled\nl
With things and creatures that could help and hurt:\nl
The world's values hung upon their little self.\nl
Isolated, cramped in the vast unknown,\nl
To save their small lives from surrounding Death\nl
They made a tiny circle of defence\nl
Against the siege of the huge universe:\nl
They preyed upon the world and were its prey,\nl
But never dreamed to conquer and be free.\nl
Obeying the World-Power's hints and firm taboos\nl
A scanty part they drew from her rich store;\nl
There was no conscious code and no life-plan:\nl
The patterns of thinking of a little group\nl
Fixed a traditional behaviour's law.\nl
Ignorant of soul save as a wraith within,\nl
Tied to a mechanism of unchanging lives\nl
And to a dull usual sense and feeling's beat,\nl
They turned in grooves of animal desire.\nl
In walls of stone fenced round they worked and warred,\nl
Did by a banded selfishness a small good\nl
Or wrought a dreadful wrong and cruel pain\nl
On sentient lives and thought they did no ill.\nl
Ardent from the sack of happy peaceful homes\nl
And gorged with slaughter, plunder, rape and fire,\nl
They made of human selves their helpless prey,\nl
A drove of captives led to lifelong woe,\nl
Or torture a spectacle made and holiday,\nl
Mocking or thrilled by their torn victims' pangs;\nl
Admiring themselves as titans and as gods\nl
Proudly they sang their high and glorious deeds\nl
And praised their victory and their splendid force.\nl
An animal in the instinctive herd\nl
Pushed by life impulses, forced by common needs,\nl
Each in his own kind saw his ego's glass;\nl
All served the aim and action of the pack.\nl
Those like himself, by blood or custom kin,\nl
Page 144

To him were parts of his life, his adjunct selves,\nl
His personal nebula's constituent stars,\nl
Satellite companions of his solar I.\nl
A master of his life's environment,\nl
A leader of a huddled human mass\nl
Herding for safety on a dangerous earth,\nl
He gathered them round him as if minor Powers\nl
To make a common front against the world,\nl
Or, weak and sole on an indifferent earth,\nl
As a fortress for his undefended heart,\nl
Or else to heal his body's loneliness.\nl
In others than his kind he sensed a foe,\nl
An alien unlike force to shun and fear,\nl
A stranger and adversary to hate and slay.\nl
Or he lived as lives the solitary brute;\nl
At war with all he bore his single fate.\nl
Absorbed in the present act, the fleeting days,\nl
None thought to look beyond the hour's gains,\nl
Or dreamed to make this earth a fairer world,\nl
Or felt some touch divine surprise his heart.\nl
The gladness that the fugitive moment gave,\nl
The desire grasped, the bliss, the experience won,\nl
Movement and speed and strength were joy enough\nl
And bodily longings shared and quarrel and play,\nl
And tears and laughter and the need called love.\nl
In war and clasp these life-wants joined the All-Life,\nl
Wrestlings of a divided unity\nl
Inflicting mutual grief and happiness\nl
In ignorance of the Self for ever one.\nl
Arming its creatures with delight and hope\nl
A half-awakened Nescience struggled there\nl
To know by sight and touch the outside of things.\nl
Instinct was formed; in memory's crowded sleep\nl
The past lived on as in a bottomless sea:\nl
Inverting into half-thought the quickened sense\nl
She felt around for truth with fumbling hands,\nl
Page 145

Clutched to her the little she could reach and seize\nl
And put aside in her subconscient cave.\nl
So must the dim being grow in light and force\nl
And rise to his higher destiny at last,\nl
Look up to God and round at the universe,\nl
And learn by failure and progress by fall\nl
And battle with environment and doom,\nl
By suffering discover his deep soul\nl
And by possession grow to his own vasts.\nl
Half-way she stopped and found her path no more.\nl
Still nothing was achieved but to begin,\nl
Yet finished seemed the circle of her force.\nl
Only she had beaten out sparks of ignorance;\nl
Only the life could think and not the mind,\nl
Only the sense could feel and not the soul.\nl
Only was lit some heat of the flame of Life,\nl
Some joy to be, some rapturous leaps of sense.\nl
All was an impetus of half-conscious Force,\nl
A spirit sprawling drowned in dense life-foam,\nl
A vague self grasping at the shape of things.\nl
Behind all moved seeking for vessels to hold\nl
A first raw vintage of the grapes of God,\nl
On earth's mud a spilth of the supernal Bliss,\nl
Intoxicating the stupefied soul and mind\nl
A heady wine of rapture dark and crude,\nl
Dim, uncast yet into spiritual form,\nl
Obscure inhabitant of the world's blind core,\nl
An unborn godhead's will, a mute Desire.\nl

\spar A third creation now revealed its face.\nl
A mould of body's early mind was made.\nl
A glint of light kindled the obscure World-Force;\nl
It dowered a driven world with the seeing Idea\nl
And armed the act with thought's dynamic point:\nl
A small thinking being watched the works of Time.\nl
A difficult evolution from below\nl
Page 146

Called a masked intervention from above;\nl
Else this great, blind inconscient universe\nl
Could never have disclosed its hidden mind,\nl
Or even in blinkers worked in beast and man\nl
The Intelligence that devised the cosmic scheme.\nl
At first he saw a dim obscure mind-power\nl
Moving concealed by Matter and dumb life.\nl
A current thin, it streamed in life's vast flow\nl
Tossing and drifting under a drifting sky\nl
Amid the surge and glimmering tremulous wash,\nl
Released in splash of sense and feeling's waves.\nl
In the deep midst of an insentient world\nl
Its huddled waves and foam of consciousness ran\nl
Pressing and eddying through a narrow strait,\nl
Carrying experience in its crowded pace.\nl
It flowed emerging into upper light\nl
From the deep pool of its subliminal birth\nl
To reach some high existence still unknown.\nl
There was no thinking self, aim there was none:\nl
All was unorganised stress and seekings vague.\nl
Only to the unstable surface rose\nl
Sensations, stabs and edges of desire\nl
And passion's leaps and brief emotion's cries,\nl
A casual colloquy of flesh with flesh,\nl
A murmur of heart to longing wordless heart,\nl
Glimmerings of knowledge with no shape of thought\nl
And jets of subconscious will or hunger's pulls.\nl
All was dim sparkle on a foaming top:\nl
It whirled around a drifting shadow-self\nl
On an inconscient flood of Force in Time.\nl
Then came the pressure of a seeing Power\nl
That drew all into a dancing turbid mass\nl
Circling around a single luminous point,\nl
Centre of reference in a conscious field,\nl
Figure of a unitary Light within.\nl
It lit the impulse of the half-sentient flood,\nl
Page 147

Even an illusion gave of fixity\nl
As if a sea could serve as a firm soil.\nl
That strange observing Power imposed its sight.\nl
It forced on flux a limit and a shape,\nl
It gave its stream a lower narrow bank,\nl
Drew lines to snare the spirit's formlessness.\nl
It fashioned the life-mind of bird and beast,\nl
The answer of the reptile and the fish,\nl
The primitive pattern of the thoughts of man.\nl
A finite movement of the Infinite\nl
Came winging its way through a wide air of Time;\nl
A march of knowledge moved in Nescience\nl
And guarded in the form a separate soul.\nl
Its right to be immortal it reserved,\nl
But built a wall against the siege of death\nl
And threw a hook to clutch eternity.\nl
A thinking entity appeared in Space.\nl
A little ordered world broke into view\nl
Where being had prison-room for act and sight,\nl
A floor to walk, a clear but scanty range.\nl
An instrument-personality was born,\nl
And a restricted clamped intelligence\nl
Consented to confine in narrow bounds\nl
Its seeking; it tied the thought to visible things,\nl
Prohibiting the adventure of the Unseen\nl
And the soul's tread through unknown infinities.\nl
A reflex reason, Nature-habit's glass\nl
Illumined life to know and fix its field,\nl
Accept a dangerous ignorant brevity\nl
And the inconclusive purpose of its walk\nl
And profit by the hour's precarious chance\nl
In the allotted boundaries of its fate.\nl
A little joy and knowledge satisfied\nl
This little being tied into a knot\nl
And hung on a bulge of its environment,\nl
A little curve cut off in measureless Space,\nl
Page 148

A little span of life in all vast Time.\nl
A thought was there that planned, a will that strove,\nl
But for small aims within a narrow scope,\nl
Wasting unmeasured toil on transient things.\nl
It knew itself a creature of the mud;\nl
It asked no larger law, no loftier aim;\nl
It had no inward look, no upward gaze.\nl
A backward scholar on logic's rickety bench\nl
Indoctrinated by the erring sense,\nl
It took appearance for the face of God,\nl
For casual lights the marching of the suns,\nl
For heaven a starry strip of doubtful blue;\nl
Aspects of being feigned to be the whole.\nl
There was a voice of busy interchange,\nl
A market-place of trivial thoughts and acts:\nl
A life soon spent, a mind the body's slave\nl
Here seemed the brilliant crown of Nature's work,\nl
And tiny egos took the world as means\nl
To sate awhile dwarf lusts and brief desires,\nl
In a death-closed passage saw life's start and end\nl
As though a blind alley were creation's sign,\nl
As if for this the soul had coveted birth\nl
In the wonderland of a self-creating world\nl
And the opportunities of cosmic Space.\nl
This creature passionate only to survive,\nl
Fettered to puny thoughts with no wide range\nl
And to the body's needs and pangs and joys,\nl
This fire growing by its fuel's death,\nl
Increased by what it seized and made its own:\nl
It gathered and grew and gave itself to none.\nl
Only it hoped for greatness in its den\nl
And pleasure and victory in small fields of power\nl
And conquest of life-room for self and kin,\nl
An animal limited by its feeding-space.\nl
It knew not the Immortal in its house;\nl
It had no greater deeper cause to live.\nl
Page 149

In limits only it was powerful;\nl
Acute to capture truth for outward use,\nl
Its knowledge was the body's instrument;\nl
Absorbed in the little works of its prison-house\nl
It turned around the same unchanging points\nl
In the same circle of interest and desire,\nl
But thought itself the master of its jail.\nl
Although for action, not for wisdom made,\nl
Thought was its apex—or its gutter's rim:\nl
It saw an image of the external world\nl
And saw its surface self, but knew no more.\nl
Out of a slow confused embroiled self-search\nl
Mind grew to a clarity cut out, precise,\nl
A gleam enclosed in a stone ignorance.\nl
In this bound thinking's narrow leadership\nl
Tied to the soil, inspired by common things,\nl
Attached to a confined familiar world,\nl
Amid the multitude of her motived plots,\nl
Her changing actors and her million masks,\nl
Life was a play monotonously the same.\nl
There were no vast perspectives of the spirit,\nl
No swift invasions of unknown delight,\nl
No golden distances of wide release.\nl
This petty state resembled our human days\nl
But fixed to eternity of changeless type,\nl
A moment's movement doomed to last through Time.\nl
Existence bridge-like spanned the inconscient gulfs,\nl
A half-illumined building in a mist,\nl
Which from a void of Form arose to sight\nl
And jutted out into a void of Soul.\nl
A little light in a great darkness born,\nl
Life knew not where it went nor whence it came.\nl
Around all floated still the nescient haze.\nl

\sbigcap A fixed and narrow power with rigid forms,\nl
He saw the empire of the little life,\nl
An unhappy corner in eternity.\nl
It lived upon the margin of the Idea\nl
Protected by Ignorance as in a shell.\nl
Then, hoping to learn the secret of this world\nl
He peered across its scanty fringe of sight,\nl
To disengage from its surface-clear obscurity\nl
The Force that moved it and the Idea that made,\nl
Imposing smallness on the Infinite,\nl
The ruling spirit of its littleness,\nl
The divine law that gave it right to be,\nl
Its claim on Nature and its need in Time.\nl
He plunged his gaze into the siege of mist\nl
That held this ill-lit straitened continent\nl
Ringed with the skies and seas of ignorance\nl
And kept it safe from Truth and Self and Light.\nl
As when a searchlight stabs the Night's blind breast\nl
And dwellings and trees and figures of men appear\nl
As if revealed to an eye in Nothingness,\nl
All lurking things were torn out of their veils\nl
And held up in his vision's sun-white blaze.\nl
A busy restless uncouth populace\nl
Teemed in their dusky unnoted thousands there.\nl
In a mist of secrecy wrapping the world-scene\nl
The little deities of Time's nether act\nl
Who work remote from Heaven's controlling eye,\nl
Plotted, unknown to the creatures whom they move,\nl
The small conspiracies of this petty reign\nl
Amused with the small contrivings, the brief hopes\nl
And little eager steps and little ways\nl
Page 151

And reptile wallowings in the dark and dust,\nl
And the crouch and ignominy of creeping life.\nl
A trepidant and motley multitude,\nl
A strange pell-mell of magic artisans,\nl
Was seen moulding the plastic clay of life,\nl
An elfin brood, an elemental kind.\nl
Astonished by the unaccustomed glow,\nl
As if immanent in the shadows started up\nl
Imps with wry limbs and carved beast visages,\nl
Sprite-prompters goblin-wizened or faery-small,\nl
And genii fairer but unsouled and poor\nl
And fallen beings, their heavenly portion lost,\nl
And errant divinities trapped in Time's dust.\nl
Ignorant and dangerous wills but armed with power,\nl
Half-animal, half-god their mood, their shape.\nl
Out of the greyness of a dim background\nl
Their whispers come, an inarticulate force,\nl
Awake in mind an echoing thought or word,\nl
To their sting of impulse the heart's sanction draw,\nl
And in that little Nature do their work\nl
And fill its powers and creatures with unease.\nl
Its seed of joy they curse with sorrow's fruit,\nl
Put out with error's breath its scanty lights\nl
And turn its surface truths to falsehood's ends,\nl
Its small emotions spur, its passions drive\nl
To the abyss or through the bog and mire:\nl
Or else with a goad of hard dry lusts they prick,\nl
While jogs on devious ways that nowhere lead\nl
Life's cart finding no issue from ignorance.\nl
To sport with good and evil is their law;\nl
Luring to failure and meaningless success,\nl
All models they corrupt, all measures cheat,\nl
Make knowledge a poison, virtue a pattern dull\nl
And lead the endless cycles of desire\nl
Through semblances of sad or happy chance\nl
To an inescapable fatality.\nl
Page 152

All by their influence is enacted there.\nl
Nor there alone is their empire or their role:\nl
Wherever are soulless minds and guideless lives\nl
And in a small body self is all that counts,\nl
Wherever love and light and largeness lack,\nl
These crooked fashioners take up their task.\nl
To all half-conscious worlds they extend their reign.\nl
Here too these godlings drive our human hearts,\nl
Our nature's twilight is their lurking-place:\nl
Here too the darkened primitive heart obeys\nl
The veiled suggestions of a hidden Mind\nl
That dogs our knowledge with misleading light\nl
And stands between us and the Truth that saves.\nl
It speaks to us with the voices of the Night:\nl
Our darkened lives to greater darkness move;\nl
Our seekings listen to calamitous hopes.\nl
A structure of unseeing thoughts is built\nl
And reason used by an irrational Force.\nl
This earth is not alone our teacher and nurse;\nl
The powers of all the worlds have entrance here.\nl
In their own fields they follow the wheel of law\nl
And cherish the safety of a settled type;\nl
On earth out of their changeless orbit thrown\nl
Their law is kept, lost their fixed form of things.\nl
Into a creative chaos they are cast\nl
Where all asks order but is driven by Chance;\nl
Strangers to earth-nature, they must learn earth's ways,\nl
Aliens or opposites, they must unite:\nl
They work and battle and with pain agree:\nl
These join, those part, all parts and joins anew,\nl
But never can we know and truly live\nl
Till all have found their divine harmony.\nl
Our life's uncertain way winds circling on,\nl
Our mind's unquiet search asks always light,\nl
Till they have learned their secret in their source,\nl
In the light of the Timeless and its spaceless home,\nl
Page 153

In the joy of the Eternal sole and one.\nl
But now the Light supreme is far away:\nl
Our conscious life obeys the Inconscient's laws;\nl
To ignorant purposes and blind desires\nl
Our hearts are moved by an ambiguous force;\nl
Even our mind's conquests wear a battered crown.\nl
A slowly changing order binds our will.\nl
This is our doom until our souls are free.\nl
A mighty Hand then rolls mind's firmaments back,\nl
Infinity takes up the finite's acts\nl
And Nature steps into the eternal Light.\nl
Then only ends this dream of nether life.\nl

\spar At the outset of this enigmatic world\nl
Which seems at once an enormous brute machine\nl
And a slow unmasking of the spirit in things,\nl
In this revolving chamber without walls\nl
In which God sits impassive everywhere\nl
As if unknown to himself and by us unseen\nl
In a miracle of inconscient secrecy,\nl
Yet is all here his action and his will.\nl
In this whirl and sprawl through infinite vacancy\nl
The Spirit became Matter and lay in the whirl,\nl
A body sleeping without sense or soul.\nl
A mass phenomenon of visible shapes\nl
Supported by the silence of the Void\nl
Appeared in the eternal Consciousness\nl
And seemed an outward and insensible world.\nl
There was none there to see and none to feel;\nl
Only the miraculous Inconscient,\nl
A subtle wizard skilled, was at its task.\nl
Inventing ways for magical results,\nl
Managing creation's marvellous device,\nl
Marking mechanically dumb wisdom's points,\nl
Using the unthought inevitable Idea,\nl
It did the works of God's intelligence\nl
Page 154

Or wrought the will of some supreme Unknown.\nl
Still consciousness was hidden in Nature's womb,\nl
Unfelt was the Bliss whose rapture dreamed the worlds.\nl
Being was an inert substance driven by Force.\nl
At first was only an etheric Space:\nl
Its huge vibrations circled round and round\nl
Housing some unconceived initiative:\nl
Upheld by a supreme original Breath\nl
Expansion and contraction's mystic act\nl
Created touch and friction in the void,\nl
Into abstract emptiness brought clash and clasp:\nl
Parent of an expanding universe\nl
In a matrix of disintegrating force,\nl
By spending it conserved an endless sum.\nl
On the hearth of Space it kindled a viewless Fire\nl
That, scattering worlds as one might scatter seeds,\nl
Whirled out the luminous order of the stars.\nl
An ocean of electric Energy\nl
Formlessly formed its strange wave-particles\nl
Constructing by their dance this solid scheme,\nl
Its mightiness in the atom shut to rest;\nl
Masses were forged or feigned and visible shapes;\nl
Light flung the photon's swift revealing spark\nl
And showed, in the minuteness of its flash\nl
Imaged, this cosmos of apparent things.\nl
Thus has been made this real impossible world,\nl
An obvious miracle or convincing show.\nl
Or so it seems to man's audacious mind\nl
Who seats his thought as the arbiter of truth,\nl
His personal vision as impersonal fact,\nl
As witnesses of an objective world\nl
His erring sense and his instruments' artifice.\nl
Thus must he work life's tangible riddle out\nl
In a doubtful light, by error seize on Truth\nl
And slowly part the visage and the veil.\nl
Or else, forlorn of faith in mind and sense,\nl
Page 155

His knowledge a bright body of ignorance,\nl
He sees in all things strangely fashioned here\nl
The unwelcome jest of a deceiving Force,\nl
A parable of Maya and her might.\nl
This vast perpetual motion caught and held\nl
In the mysterious and unchanging change\nl
Of the persistent movement we call Time\nl
And ever renewing its recurrent beat,\nl
These mobile rounds that stereotype a flux,\nl
These static objects in the cosmic dance\nl
That are but Energy's self-repeating whorls\nl
Prolonged by the spirit of the brooding Void,\nl
Awaited life and sense and waking Mind.\nl
A little the Dreamer changed his pose of stone.\nl
But when the Inconscient's scrupulous work was done\nl
And Chance coerced by fixed immutable laws,\nl
A scene was set for Nature's conscious play.\nl
Then stirred the Spirit's mute immobile sleep;\nl
The Force concealed broke dumbly, slowly out.\nl
A dream of living woke in Matter's heart,\nl
A will to live moved the Inconscient's dust,\nl
A freak of living startled vacant Time,\nl
Ephemeral in a blank eternity,\nl
Infinitesimal in a dead Infinite.\nl
A subtler breath quickened dead Matter's forms;\nl
The world's set rhythm changed to a conscious cry;\nl
A serpent Power twinned the insensible Force.\nl
Islands of living dotted lifeless Space\nl
And germs of living formed in formless air.\nl
A Life was born that followed Matter's law,\nl
Ignorant of the motives of its steps;\nl
Ever inconstant, yet for ever the same,\nl
It repeated the paradox that gave it birth:\nl
Its restless and unstable stabilities\nl
Recurred incessantly in the flow of Time\nl
And purposeful movements in unthinking forms\nl
Page 156

Betrayed the heavings of an imprisoned Will.\nl
Waking and sleep lay locked in mutual arms;\nl
Helpless and indistinct came pleasure and pain\nl
Trembling with the first faint thrills of a World-Soul.\nl
A strength of life that could not cry or move,\nl
Yet broke into beauty signing some deep delight:\nl
An inarticulate sensibility,\nl
Throbs of the heart of an unknowing world,\nl
Ran through its somnolent torpor and there stirred\nl
A vague uncertain thrill, a wandering beat,\nl
A dim unclosing as of secret eyes.\nl
Infant self-feeling grew and birth was born.\nl
A godhead woke but lay with dreaming limbs;\nl
Her house refused to open its sealed doors.\nl
Insentient to our eyes that only see\nl
The form, the act and not the imprisoned God,\nl
Life hid in her pulse occult of growth and power\nl
A consciousness with mute stifled beats of sense,\nl
A mind suppressed that knew not yet of thought,\nl
An inert spirit that could only be.\nl
At first she raised no voice, no motion dared:\nl
Charged with world-power, instinct with living force,\nl
Only she clung with her roots to the safe earth,\nl
Thrilled dumbly to the shocks of ray and breeze\nl
And put out tendril fingers of desire;\nl
The strength in her yearning for sun and light\nl
Felt not the embrace that made her breathe and live;\nl
Absorbed she dreamed content with beauty and hue.\nl
At last the charmed Immensity looked forth:\nl
Astir, vibrant, hungering, she groped for mind;\nl
Then slowly sense quivered and thought peered out;\nl
She forced the reluctant mould to grow aware.\nl
The magic was chiselled of a conscious form;\nl
Its tranced vibrations rhythmed a quick response,\nl
And luminous stirrings prompted brain and nerve,\nl
Awoke in Matter spirit's identity\nl
Page 157

And in a body lit the miracle\nl
Of the heart's love and the soul's witness gaze.\nl
Impelled by an unseen Will there could break out\nl
Fragments of some vast impulse to become\nl
And vivid glimpses of a secret self,\nl
And the doubtful seeds and force of shapes to be\nl
Awoke from the inconscient swoon of things.\nl
An animal creation crept and ran\nl
And flew and called between the earth and sky,\nl
Hunted by death but hoping still to live\nl
And glad to breathe if only for a while.\nl
Then man was moulded from the original brute.\nl
A thinking mind had come to lift life's moods,\nl
The keen-edged tool of a Nature mixed and vague,\nl
An intelligence half-witness, half-machine.\nl
This seeming driver of her wheel of works\nl
Missioned to motive and record her drift\nl
And fix its law on her inconstant powers,\nl
This master-spring of a delicate enginery,\nl
Aspired to enlighten its user and refine\nl
Lifting to a vision of the indwelling Power\nl
The absorbed mechanic's crude initiative:\nl
He raised his eyes; Heaven-light mirrored a Face.\nl
Amazed at the works wrought in her mystic sleep,\nl
She looked upon the world that she had made:\nl
Wondering now seized the great automaton;\nl
She paused to understand her self and aim,\nl
Pondering she learned to act by conscious rule,\nl
A visioned measure guided her rhythmic steps;\nl
Thought bordered her instincts with a frame of will\nl
And lit with the idea her blinded urge.\nl
On her mass of impulses, her reflex acts,\nl
On the Inconscient's pushed or guided drift\nl
And mystery of unthinking accurate steps\nl
She stuck the specious image of a self,\nl
A living idol of disfigured spirit;\nl
Page 158

On Matter's acts she imposed a patterned law;\nl
She made a thinking body from chemic cells\nl
And moulded a being out of a driven force.\nl
To be what she was not inflamed her hope:\nl
She turned her dream towards some high Unknown;\nl
A breath was felt below of One supreme.\nl
An opening looked up to spheres above\nl
And coloured shadows limned on mortal ground\nl
The passing figures of immortal things;\nl
A quick celestial flash could sometimes come:\nl
The illumined soul-ray fell on heart and flesh\nl
And touched with semblances of ideal light\nl
The stuff of which our earthly dreams are made.\nl
A fragile human love that could not last,\nl
Ego's moth-wings to lift the seraph soul,\nl
Appeared, a surface glamour of brief date\nl
Extinguished by a scanty breath of Time;\nl
Joy that forgot mortality for a while\nl
Came, a rare visitor who left betimes,\nl
And made all things seem beautiful for an hour,\nl
Hopes that soon fade to drab realities\nl
And passions that crumble to ashes while they blaze\nl
Kindled the common earth with their brief flame.\nl
A creature insignificant and small\nl
Visited, uplifted by an unknown Power,\nl
Man laboured on his little patch of earth\nl
For means to last, to enjoy, to suffer and die.\nl
A spirit that perished not with the body and breath\nl
Was there like a shadow of the Unmanifest\nl
And stood behind the little personal form\nl
But claimed not yet this earthly embodiment.\nl
Assenting to Nature's long slow-moving toil,\nl
Watching the works of his own Ignorance,\nl
Unknown, unfelt the mighty Witness lives\nl
And nothing shows the Glory that is here.\nl
A Wisdom governing the mystic world,\nl
Page 159

A Silence listening to the cry of Life,\nl
It sees the hurrying crowd of moments stream\nl
Towards the still greatness of a distant hour.\nl

\spar This huge world unintelligibly turns\nl
In the shadow of a mused Inconscience;\nl
It hides a key to inner meanings missed,\nl
It locks in our hearts a voice we cannot hear.\nl
An enigmatic labour of the spirit,\nl
An exact machine of which none knows the use,\nl
An art and ingenuity without sense,\nl
This minute elaborate orchestrated life\nl
For ever plays its motiveless symphonies.\nl
The mind learns and knows not, turning its back to truth;\nl
It studies surface laws by surface thought,\nl
Life's steps surveys and Nature's process sees,\nl
Not seeing for what she acts or why we live;\nl
It marks her tireless care of just device,\nl
Her patient intricacy of fine detail,\nl
The ingenious spirit's brave inventive plan\nl
In her great futile mass of endless works,\nl
Adds purposeful figures to her purposeless sum,\nl
Its gabled storeys piles, its climbing roofs\nl
On the close-carved foundations she has laid,\nl
Imagined citadels reared in mythic air\nl
Or mounts a stair of dream to a mystic moon:\nl
Transient creations point and hit the sky:\nl
A world-conjecture's scheme is laboured out\nl
On the dim floor of mind's incertitude,\nl
Or painfully built a fragmentary whole.\nl
Impenetrable, a mystery recondite\nl
Is the vast plan of which we are a part;\nl
Its harmonies are discords to our view\nl
Because we know not the great theme they serve.\nl
Inscrutable work the cosmic agencies.\nl
Only the fringe of a wide surge we see;\nl
Page 160

Our instruments have not that greater light,\nl
Our will tunes not with the eternal Will,\nl
Our heart's sight is too blind and passionate.\nl
Impotent to share in Nature's mystic tact,\nl
Inapt to feel the pulse and core of things,\nl
Our reason cannot sound life's mighty sea\nl
And only counts its waves and scans its foam;\nl
It knows not whence these motions touch and pass,\nl
It sees not whither sweeps the hurrying flood:\nl
Only it strives to canalise its powers\nl
And hopes to turn its course to human ends:\nl
But all its means come from the Inconscient's store.\nl
Unseen here act dim huge world-energies\nl
And only trickles and currents are our share.\nl
Our mind lives far off from the authentic Light\nl
Catching at little fragments of the Truth\nl
In a small corner of infinity,\nl
Our lives are inlets of an ocean's force.\nl
Our conscious movements have sealed origins\nl
But with those shadowy seats no converse hold;\nl
No understanding binds our comrade parts;\nl
Our acts emerge from a crypt our minds ignore.\nl
Our deepest depths are ignorant of themselves;\nl
Even our body is a mystery shop;\nl
As our earth's roots lurk screened below our earth,\nl
So lie unseen our roots of mind and life.\nl
Our springs are kept close hid beneath, within;\nl
Our souls are moved by powers behind the wall.\nl
In the subterranean reaches of the spirit\nl
A puissance acts and recks not what it means;\nl
Using unthinking monitors and scribes,\nl
It is the cause of what we think and feel.\nl
The troglodytes of the subconscious Mind,\nl
Ill-trained slow stammering interpreters\nl
Only of their small task's routine aware\nl
And busy with the record in our cells,\nl
Page 161

Concealed in the subliminal secrecies\nl
Mid an obscure occult machinery,\nl
Capture the mystic Morse whose measured lilt\nl
Transmits the messages of the cosmic Force.\nl
A whisper falls into life's inner ear\nl
And echoes from the dun subconscient caves,\nl
Speech leaps, thought quivers, the heart vibrates, the will\nl
Answers and tissue and nerve obey the call.\nl
Our lives translate these subtle intimacies;\nl
All is the commerce of a secret Power.\nl
\sparn A thinking puppet is the mind of life:\nl
Its choice is the work of elemental strengths\nl
That know not their own birth and end and cause\nl
And glimpse not the immense intent they serve.\nl
In this nether life of man drab-hued and dull,\nl
Yet filled with poignant small ignoble things,\nl
The conscious Doll is pushed a hundred ways\nl
And feels the push but not the hands that drive.\nl
For none can see the masked ironic troupe\nl
To whom our figure-selves are marionettes,\nl
Our deeds unwitting movements in their grasp,\nl
Our passionate strife an entertainment's scene.\nl
Ignorant themselves of their own fount of strength\nl
They play their part in the enormous whole.\nl
Agents of darkness imitating light,\nl
Spirits obscure and moving things obscure,\nl
Unwillingly they serve a mightier Power.\nl
Ananke's engines organising Chance,\nl
Channels perverse of a stupendous Will,\nl
Tools of the Unknown who use us as their tools,\nl
Invested with power in Nature's nether state,\nl
Into the actions mortals think their own\nl
They bring the incoherencies of Fate,\nl
Or make a doom of Time's slipshod caprice\nl
And toss the lives of men from hand to hand\nl
In an inconsequent and devious game.\nl
Page 162

Against all higher truth their stuff rebels;\nl
Only to Titan force their will lies prone.\nl
Inordinate their hold on human hearts,\nl
In all our nature's turns they intervene.\nl
Insignificant architects of low-built lives\nl
And engineers of interest and desire,\nl
Out of crude earthiness and muddy thrills\nl
And coarse reactions of material nerve\nl
They build our huddled structures of self-will\nl
And the ill-lighted mansions of our thought,\nl
Or with the ego's factories and marts\nl
Surround the beautiful temple of the soul.\nl
Artists minute of the hues of littleness,\nl
They set the mosaic of our comedy\nl
Or plan the trivial tragedy of our days,\nl
Arrange the deed, combine the circumstance\nl
And the fantasia of the moods costume.\nl
These unwise prompters of man's ignorant heart\nl
And tutors of his stumbling speech and will,\nl
Movers of petty wraths and lusts and hates\nl
And changeful thoughts and shallow emotion's starts,\nl
These slight illusion-makers with their masks,\nl
Painters of the decor of a dull-hued stage\nl
And nimble scene-shifters of the human play,\nl
Ever are busy with this ill-lit scene.\nl
Ourselves incapable to build our fate\nl
Only as actors speak and strut our parts\nl
Until the piece is done and we pass off\nl
Into a brighter Time and subtler Space.\nl
Thus they inflict their little pigmy law\nl
And curb the mounting slow uprise of man,\nl
Then his too scanty walk with death they close.\nl

\spar This is the ephemeral creature's daily life.\nl
As long as the human animal is lord\nl
And a dense nether nature screens the soul,\nl
Page 163

As long as intellect's outward-gazing sight\nl
Serves earthy interest and creature joys,\nl
An incurable littleness pursues his days.\nl
Ever since consciousness was born on earth,\nl
Life is the same in insect, ape and man,\nl
Its stuff unchanged, its way the common route.\nl
If new designs, if richer details grow\nl
And thought is added and more tangled cares,\nl
If little by little it wears a brighter face,\nl
Still even in man the plot is mean and poor.\nl
A gross content prolongs his fallen state;\nl
His small successes are failures of the soul,\nl
His little pleasures punctuate frequent griefs:\nl
Hardship and toil are the heavy price he pays\nl
For the right to live and his last wages death.\nl
An inertia sunk towards inconscience,\nl
A sleep that imitates death is his repose.\nl
A puny splendour of creative force\nl
Is made his spur to fragile human works\nl
Which yet outlast their brief creator's breath.\nl
He dreams sometimes of the revels of the gods\nl
And sees the Dionysian gesture pass,—\nl
A leonine greatness that would tear his soul\nl
If through his failing limbs and fainting heart\nl
The sweet and joyful mighty madness swept:\nl
Trivial amusements stimulate and waste\nl
The energy given to him to grow and be.\nl
His little hour is spent in little things.\nl
A brief companionship with many jars,\nl
A little love and jealousy and hate,\nl
A touch of friendship mid indifferent crowds\nl
Draw his heart-plan on life's diminutive map.\nl
If something great awakes, too frail his pitch\nl
To reveal its zenith tension of delight,\nl
His thought to eternise its ephemeral soar,\nl
Art's brilliant gleam is a pastime for his eyes,\nl
Page 164

A thrill that smites the nerves is music's spell.\nl
Amidst his harassed toil and welter of cares,\nl
Pressed by the labour of his crowding thoughts,\nl
He draws sometimes around his aching brow\nl
Nature's calm mighty hands to heal his life-pain.\nl
He is saved by her silence from his rack of self;\nl
In her tranquil beauty is his purest bliss.\nl
A new life dawns, he looks out from vistas wide;\nl
The Spirit's breath moves him but soon retires:\nl
His strength was not made to hold that puissant guest.\nl
All dulls down to convention and routine\nl
Or a fierce excitement brings him vivid joys:\nl
His days are tinged with the red hue of strife\nl
And lust's hot glare and passion's crimson stain;\nl
Battle and murder are his tribal game.\nl
Time has he none to turn his eyes within\nl
And look for his lost self and his dead soul.\nl
His motion on too short an axis wheels;\nl
He cannot soar but creeps on his long road\nl
Or if, impatient of the trudge of Time,\nl
He would make a splendid haste on Fate's slow road,\nl
His heart that runs soon pants and tires and sinks;\nl
Or he walks ever on and finds no end.\nl
Hardly a few can climb to greater life.\nl
All tunes to a low scale and conscious pitch.\nl
His knowledge dwells in the house of Ignorance;\nl
His force nears not even once the Omnipotent,\nl
Rare are his visits of heavenly ecstasy.\nl
The bliss which sleeps in things and tries to wake,\nl
Breaks out in him in a small joy of life:\nl
This scanty grace is his persistent stay;\nl
It lightens the burden of his many ills\nl
And reconciles him to his little world.\nl
He is satisfied with his common average kind;\nl
Tomorrow's hopes and his old rounds of thought,\nl
His old familiar interests and desires\nl
Page 165

He has made into a thick and narrowing hedge\nl
Defending his small life from the Invisible;\nl
His being's kinship to infinity\nl
He has shut away from him into inmost self,\nl
Fenced off the greatnesses of hidden God.\nl
His being was formed to play a trivial part\nl
In a little drama on a petty stage;\nl
In a narrow plot he has pitched his tent of life\nl
Beneath the wide gaze of the starry Vast.\nl
He is the crown of all that has been done:\nl
Thus is creation's labour justified;\nl
This is the world's result, Nature's last poise!\nl
And if this were all and nothing more were meant,\nl
If what now seems were the whole of what must be,\nl
If this were not a stade through which we pass\nl
On our road from Matter to eternal Self,\nl
To the Light that made the worlds, the Cause of things,\nl
Well might interpret our mind's limited view\nl
Existence as an accident in Time,\nl
Illusion or phenomenon or freak,\nl
The paradox of a creative Thought\nl
Which moves between unreal opposites,\nl
Inanimate Force struggling to feel and know,\nl
Matter that chanced to read itself by Mind,\nl
Inconscience monstrously engendering soul.\nl
At times all looks unreal and remote:\nl
We seem to live in a fiction of our thoughts\nl
Pieced from sensation's fanciful traveller's tale,\nl
Or caught on the film of the recording brain,\nl
A figment or circumstance in cosmic sleep.\nl
A somnambulist walking under the moon,\nl
An image of ego treads through an ignorant dream\nl
Counting the moments of a spectral Time.\nl
In a false perspective of effect and cause,\nl
Trusting to a specious prospect of world-space,\nl
It drifts incessantly from scene to scene,\nl
Page 166

Whither it knows not, to what fabulous verge.\nl
All here is dreamed or doubtfully exists,\nl
But who the dreamer is and whence he looks\nl
Is still unknown or only a shadowy guess.\nl
Or the world is real but ourselves too small,\nl
Insufficient for the mightiness of our stage.\nl
A thin life-curve crosses the titan whirl\nl
Of the orbit of a soulless universe,\nl
And in the belly of the sparse rolling mass\nl
A mind looks out from a small casual globe\nl
And wonders what itself and all things are.\nl
And yet to some interned subjective sight\nl
That strangely has formed in Matter's sightless stuff,\nl
A pointillage minute of little self\nl
Takes figure as world-being's conscious base.\nl
Such is our scene in the half-light below.\nl
This is the sign of Matter's infinite,\nl
This the weird purport of the picture shown\nl
To Science the giantess, measurer of her field,\nl
As she pores on the record of her close survey\nl
And mathematises her huge external world,\nl
To Reason bound within the circle of sense,\nl
Or in Thought's broad impalpable Exchange\nl
A speculator in tenuous vast ideas,\nl
Abstractions in the void her currency\nl
We know not with what firm values for its base.\nl
Only religion in this bankruptcy\nl
Presents its dubious riches to our hearts\nl
Or signs unprovisioned cheques on the Beyond:\nl
Our poverty shall there have its revenge.\nl
Our spirits depart discarding a futile life\nl
Into the blank unknown or with them take\nl
Death's passport into immortality.\nl

\spar Yet was this only a provisional scheme,\nl
A false appearance sketched by limiting sense,\nl
Page 167

Mind's insufficient self-discovery,\nl
An early attempt, a first experiment.\nl
This was a toy to amuse the infant earth;\nl
But knowledge ends not in these surface powers\nl
That live upon a ledge in the Ignorance\nl
And dare not look into the dangerous depths\nl
Or to stare upward measuring the Unknown.\nl
There is a deeper seeing from within\nl
And, when we have left these small purlieus of mind,\nl
A greater vision meets us on the heights\nl
In the luminous wideness of the spirit's gaze.\nl
At last there wakes in us a witness Soul\nl
That looks at truths unseen and scans the Unknown;\nl
Then all assumes a new and marvellous face:\nl
The world quivers with a God-light at its core,\nl
In Time's deep heart high purposes move and live,\nl
Life's borders crumble and join infinity.\nl
This broad, confused, yet rigid scheme becomes\nl
A magnificent imbroglio of the Gods,\nl
A game, a work ambiguously divine.\nl
Our seekings are short-lived experiments\nl
Made by a wordless and inscrutable Power\nl
Testing its issues from inconscient Night\nl
To meet its luminous self of Truth and Bliss.\nl
It peers at the Real through the apparent form;\nl
It labours in our mortal mind and sense;\nl
Amid the figures of the Ignorance,\nl
In the symbol pictures drawn by word and thought,\nl
It seeks the truth to which all figures point;\nl
It looks for the source of Light with vision's lamp;\nl
It works to find the Doer of all works,\nl
The unfelt Self within who is the guide,\nl
The unknown Self above who is the goal.\nl
All is not here a blinded Nature's task:\nl
A Word, a Wisdom watches us from on high,\nl
A Witness sanctioning her will and works,\nl
Page 168

An Eye unseen in the unseeing vast;\nl
There is an Influence from a Light above,\nl
There are thoughts remote and sealed eternities;\nl
A mystic motive drives the stars and suns.\nl
In this passage from a deaf unknowing Force\nl
To struggling consciousness and transient breath\nl
A mighty Supernature waits on Time.\nl
The world is other than we now think and see,\nl
Our lives a deeper mystery than we have dreamed;\nl
Our minds are starters in the race to God,\nl
Our souls deputed selves of the Supreme.\nl
Across the cosmic field through narrow lanes\nl
Asking a scanty dole from Fortune's hands\nl
And garbed in beggar's robes there walks the One.\nl
Even in the theatre of these small lives\nl
Behind the act a secret sweetness breathes,\nl
An urge of miniature divinity.\nl
A mystic passion from the wells of God\nl
Flows through the guarded spaces of the soul;\nl
A force that helps supports the suffering earth,\nl
An unseen nearness and a hidden joy.\nl
There are muffled throbs of laughter's undertones,\nl
The murmur of an occult happiness,\nl
An exultation in the depths of sleep,\nl
A heart of bliss within a world of pain.\nl
An Infant nursed on Nature's covert breast,\nl
An Infant playing in the magic woods,\nl
Fluting to rapture by the spirit's streams,\nl
Awaits the hour when we shall turn to his call.\nl
In this investiture of fleshly life\nl
A soul that is a spark of God survives\nl
And sometimes it breaks through the sordid screen\nl
And kindles a fire that makes us half-divine.\nl
In our body's cells there sits a hidden Power\nl
That sees the unseen and plans eternity,\nl
Our smallest parts have room for deepest needs;\nl
Page 169

There too the golden Messengers can come:\nl
A door is cut in the mud wall of self;\nl
Across the lowly threshold with bowed heads\nl
Angels of ecstasy and self-giving pass,\nl
And lodged in an inner sanctuary of dream\nl
The makers of the image of deity live.\nl
Pity is there and fire-winged sacrifice,\nl
And flashes of sympathy and tenderness\nl
Cast heaven-lights from the heart's secluded shrine.\nl
A work is done in the deep silences;\nl
A glory and wonder of spiritual sense,\nl
A laughter in beauty's everlasting space\nl
Transforming world-experience into joy,\nl
Inhabit the mystery of the untouched gulfs;\nl
Lulled by Time's beats eternity sleeps in us.\nl
In the sealed hermetic heart, the happy core,\nl
Unmoved behind this outer shape of death\nl
The eternal Entity prepares within\nl
Its matter of divine felicity,\nl
Its reign of heavenly phenomenon.\nl
Even in our sceptic mind of ignorance\nl
A foresight comes of some immense release,\nl
Our will lifts towards it slow and shaping hands.\nl
Each part in us desires its absolute.\nl
Our thoughts covet the everlasting Light,\nl
Our strength derives from an omnipotent Force,\nl
And since from a veiled God-joy the worlds were made\nl
And since eternal Beauty asks for form\nl
Even here where all is made of being's dust,\nl
Our hearts are captured by ensnaring shapes,\nl
Our very senses blindly seek for bliss.\nl
Our error crucifies Reality\nl
To force its birth and divine body here,\nl
Compelling, incarnate in a human form\nl
And breathing in limbs that one can touch and clasp,\nl
Its Knowledge to rescue an ancient Ignorance,\nl
Page 170

Its saviour light the inconscient universe.\nl
And when that greater Self comes sea-like down\nl
To fill this image of our transience,\nl
All shall be captured by delight, transformed:\nl
In waves of undreamed ecstasy shall roll\nl
Our mind and life and sense and laugh in a light\nl
Other than this hard limited human day,\nl
The body's tissues thrill apotheosised,\nl
Its cells sustain bright metamorphosis.\nl
This little being of Time, this shadow soul,\nl
This living dwarf-figurehead of darkened spirit\nl
Out of its traffic in petty dreams shall rise.\nl
Its shape of person and its ego-face\nl
Divested of this mortal travesty,\nl
Like a clay troll kneaded into a god\nl
New-made in the image of the eternal Guest,\nl
It shall be caught to the breast of a white Force\nl
And, flaming with the paradisal touch\nl
In a rose-fire of sweet spiritual grace,\nl
In the red passion of its infinite change,\nl
Quiver, awake, and shudder with ecstasy.\nl
As if reversing a deformation's spell,\nl
Released from the black magic of the Night,\nl
Renouncing servitude to the dim Abyss,\nl
It shall learn at last who lived within unseen,\nl
And seized with marvel in the adoring heart\nl
To the enthroned Child-Godhead kneel aware,\nl
Trembling with beauty and delight and love.\nl
But first the spirit's ascent we must achieve\nl
Out of the chasm from which our nature rose.\nl
The soul must soar sovereign above the form\nl
And climb to summits beyond mind's half-sleep;\nl
Our hearts we must inform with heavenly strength,\nl
Surprise the animal with the occult god.\nl
Then kindling the gold tongue of sacrifice,\nl
Calling the powers of a bright hemisphere,\nl
Page 171

We shall shed the discredit of our mortal state,\nl
Make the abysm a road for Heaven's descent,\nl
Acquaint our depths with the supernal Ray\nl
And cleave the darkness with the mystic Fire.\nl

\spar Adventuring once more in the natal mist\nl
Across the dangerous haze, the pregnant stir,\nl
He through the astral chaos shore a way\nl
Mid the grey faces of its demon gods,\nl
Questioned by whispers of its flickering ghosts,\nl
Besieged by sorceries of its fluent force.\nl
As one who walks unguided through strange fields\nl
Tending he knows not where nor with what hope,\nl
He trod a soil that failed beneath his feet\nl
And journeyed in stone strength to a fugitive end.\nl
His trail behind him was a vanishing line\nl
Of glimmering points in a vague immensity;\nl
A bodiless murmur travelled at his side\nl
In the wounded gloom complaining against light.\nl
A huge obstruction its immobile heart,\nl
The watching opacity multiplied as he moved\nl
Its hostile mass of dead and staring eyes;\nl
The darkness glimmered like a dying torch.\nl
Around him an extinguished phantom glow\nl
Peopled with shadowy and misleading shapes\nl
The vague Inconscient's dark and measureless cave.\nl
His only sunlight was his spirit's flame.\nl

\sbigcap As one who between dim receding walls\nl
Towards the far gleam of a tunnel's mouth,\nl
Hoping for light, walks now with freer pace\nl
And feels approach a breath of wider air,\nl
So he escaped from that grey anarchy.\nl
Into an ineffectual world he came,\nl
A purposeless region of arrested birth\nl
Where being from non-being fled and dared\nl
To live but had no strength long to abide.\nl
Above there gleamed a pondering brow of sky\nl
Tormented, crossed by wings of doubtful haze\nl
Adventuring with a voice of roaming winds\nl
And crying for a direction in the void\nl
Like blind souls looking for the selves they lost\nl
And wandering through unfamiliar worlds;\nl
Wings of vague questioning met the query of Space.\nl
After denial dawned a dubious hope,\nl
A hope of self and form and leave to live\nl
And the birth of that which never yet could be,\nl
And joy of the mind's hazard, the heart's choice,\nl
Grace of the unknown and hands of sudden surprise\nl
And a touch of sure delight in unsure things:\nl
To a strange uncertain tract his journey came\nl
Where consciousness played with unconscious self\nl
And birth was an attempt or episode.\nl
A charm drew near that could not keep its spell,\nl
An eager Power that could not find its way,\nl
A Chance that chose a strange arithmetic\nl
But could not bind with it the forms it made,\nl
A multitude that could not guard its sum\nl
Which less than zero grew and more than one.\nl
Page 173

Arriving at a large and shadowy sense\nl
That cared not to define its fleeting drift,\nl
Life laboured in a strange and mythic air\nl
Denuded of her sweet magnificent suns.\nl
In worlds imagined, never yet made true,\nl
A lingering glimmer on creation's verge,\nl
One strayed and dreamed and never stopped to achieve:\nl
To achieve would have destroyed that magic Space.\nl
The marvels of a twilight wonderland\nl
Full of a beauty strangely, vainly made,\nl
A surge of fanciful realities,\nl
Dim tokens of a Splendour sealed above,\nl
Awoke the passion of the eyes' desire,\nl
Compelled belief on the enamoured thought\nl
And drew the heart but led it to no goal.\nl
A magic flowed as if of moving scenes\nl
That kept awhile their fugitive delicacy\nl
Of sparing lines limned by an abstract art\nl
In a rare scanted light with faint dream-brush\nl
On a silver background of incertitude.\nl
An infant glow of heavens near to morn,\nl
A fire intense conceived but never lit,\nl
Caressed the air with ardent hints of day.\nl
The perfect longing for imperfection's charm,\nl
The illumined caught by the snare of Ignorance,\nl
Ethereal creatures drawn by body's lure\nl
To that region of promise, beating invisible wings,\nl
Came hungry for the joy of finite life\nl
But too divine to tread created soil\nl
And share the fate of perishable things.\nl
The Children of the unembodied Gleam\nl
Arisen from a formless thought in the soul\nl
And chased by an imperishable desire,\nl
Traversed the field of the pursuing gaze.\nl
A Will that unpersisting failed, worked there:\nl
Life was a search but finding never came.\nl
Page 174

There nothing satisfied, but all allured,\nl
Things seemed to be that never wholly are,\nl
Images were seen that looked like living acts\nl
And symbols hid the sense they claimed to show,\nl
Pale dreams grew real to the dreamer's eyes.\nl
The souls came there that vainly strive for birth,\nl
And spirits entrapped might wander through all time,\nl
Yet never find the truth by which they live.\nl
All ran like hopes that hunt a lurking chance;\nl
Nothing was solid, nothing felt complete:\nl
All was unsafe, miraculous and half-true.\nl
It seemed a realm of lives that had no base.\nl

\spar Then dawned a greater seeking, broadened sky,\nl
A journey under wings of brooding Force.\nl
First came the kingdom of the morning star:\nl
A twilight beauty trembled under its spear\nl
And the throb of promise of a wider Life.\nl
Then slowly rose a great and doubting sun\nl
And in its light she made of self a world.\nl
A spirit was there that sought for its own deep self,\nl
Yet was content with fragments pushed in front\nl
And parts of living that belied the whole\nl
But, pieced together, might one day be true.\nl
Yet something seemed to be achieved at last.\nl
A growing volume of the will-to-be,\nl
A text of living and a graph of force,\nl
A script of acts, a song of conscious forms\nl
Burdened with meanings fugitive from thought's grasp\nl
And crowded with undertones of life's rhythmic cry,\nl
Could write itself on the hearts of living things.\nl
In an outbreak of the might of secret Spirit,\nl
In Life and Matter's answer of delight,\nl
Some face of deathless beauty could be caught\nl
That gave immortality to a moment's joy,\nl
Some word that could incarnate highest Truth\nl
Page 175

Leaped out from a chance tension of the soul,\nl
Some hue of the Absolute could fall on life,\nl
Some glory of knowledge and intuitive sight,\nl
Some passion of the rapturous heart of Love.\nl
A hierophant of the bodiless Secrecy\nl
Interned in an unseen spiritual sheath,\nl
The Will that pushes sense beyond its scope\nl
To feel the light and joy intangible,\nl
Half found its way into the Ineffable's peace,\nl
Half captured a sealed sweetness of desire\nl
That yearned from a bosom of mysterious Bliss,\nl
Half manifested veiled Reality.\nl
A soul not wrapped into its cloak of mind\nl
Could glimpse the true sense of a world of forms;\nl
Illumined by a vision in the thought,\nl
Upbuoyed by the heart's understanding flame,\nl
It could hold in the conscious ether of the spirit\nl
The divinity of a symbol universe.\nl
\sparn This realm inspires us with our vaster hopes;\nl
Its forces have made landings on our globe,\nl
Its signs have traced their pattern in our lives:\nl
It lends a sovereign movement to our fate,\nl
Its errant waves motive our life's high surge.\nl
All that we seek for is prefigured there\nl
And all we have not known nor ever sought\nl
Which yet one day must be born in human hearts\nl
That the Timeless may fulfil itself in things.\nl
Incarnate in the mystery of the days,\nl
Eternal in an unclosed Infinite,\nl
A mounting endless possibility\nl
Climbs high upon a topless ladder of dream\nl
For ever in the Being's conscious trance.\nl
All on that ladder mounts to an unseen end.\nl
An Energy of perpetual transience makes\nl
The journey from which no return is sure,\nl
The pilgrimage of Nature to the Unknown.\nl
Page 176

As if in her ascent to her lost source\nl
She hoped to unroll all that could ever be,\nl
Her high procession moves from stage to stage,\nl
A progress leap from sight to greater sight,\nl
A process march from form to ampler form,\nl
A caravan of the inexhaustible\nl
Formations of a boundless Thought and Force.\nl
Her timeless Power that lay once on the lap\nl
Of a beginningless and endless Calm,\nl
Now severed from the Spirit's immortal bliss,\nl
Erects the type of all the joys she has lost;\nl
Compelling transient substance into shape,\nl
She hopes by the creative act's release\nl
To o'erleap sometimes the gulf she cannot fill,\nl
To heal awhile the wound of severance,\nl
Escape from the moment's prison of littleness\nl
And meet the Eternal's wide sublimities\nl
In the uncertain time-field portioned here.\nl
Almost she nears what never can be attained;\nl
She shuts eternity into an hour\nl
And fills a little soul with the Infinite;\nl
The Immobile leans to the magic of her call;\nl
She stands on a shore in the Illimitable,\nl
Perceives the formless Dweller in all forms\nl
And feels around her infinity's embrace.\nl
Her task no ending knows; she serves no aim\nl
But labours driven by a nameless Will\nl
That came from some unknowable formless Vast.\nl
This is her secret and impossible task\nl
To catch the boundless in a net of birth,\nl
To cast the spirit into physical form,\nl
To lend speech and thought to the Ineffable;\nl
She is pushed to reveal the ever Unmanifest.\nl
Yet by her skill the impossible has been done:\nl
She follows her sublime irrational plan,\nl
Invents devices of her magic art\nl
Page 177

To find new bodies for the Infinite\nl
And images of the Unimaginable;\nl
She has lured the Eternal into the arms of Time.\nl
Even now herself she knows not what she has done.\nl
For all is wrought beneath a baffling mask:\nl
A semblance other than its hidden truth\nl
The aspect wears of an illusion's trick,\nl
A feigned time-driven unreality,\nl
The unfinished creation of a changing soul\nl
In a body changing with the inhabitant.\nl
Insignificant her means, infinite her work;\nl
On a great field of shapeless consciousness\nl
In little finite strokes of mind and sense\nl
An endless Truth she endlessly unfolds;\nl
A timeless mystery works out in Time.\nl
The greatness she has dreamed her acts have missed,\nl
Her labour is a passion and a pain,\nl
A rapture and pang, her glory and her curse;\nl
And yet she cannot choose but labours on;\nl
Her mighty heart forbids her to desist.\nl
As long as the world lasts her failure lives\nl
Astonishing and foiling Reason's gaze,\nl
A folly and a beauty unspeakable,\nl
A superb madness of the will to live,\nl
A daring, a delirium of delight.\nl
This is her being's law, its sole resource;\nl
She sates, though satisfaction never comes,\nl
Her hungry will to lavish everywhere\nl
Her many-imaged fictions of the Self\nl
And thousand fashions of one Reality.\nl
A world she made touched by truth's fleeing hem,\nl
A world cast into a dream of what it seeks,\nl
An icon of truth, a conscious mystery's shape.\nl
It lingered not like the earth-mind hemmed in\nl
In solid barriers of apparent fact;\nl
It dared to trust the dream-mind and the soul.\nl
Page 178

A hunter of spiritual verities\nl
Still only thought or guessed or held by faith,\nl
It seized in imagination and confined\nl
A painted bird of paradise in a cage.\nl
This greater life is enamoured of the Unseen;\nl
It calls to some highest Light beyond its reach,\nl
It can feel the Silence that absolves the soul;\nl
It feels a saviour touch, a ray divine:\nl
Beauty and good and truth its godheads are.\nl
It is near to heavenlier heavens than earth's eyes see,\nl
A direr darkness than man's life can bear:\nl
It has kinship with the demon and the god.\nl
A strange enthusiasm has moved its heart;\nl
It hungers for heights, it passions for the supreme.\nl
It hunts for the perfect word, the perfect shape,\nl
It leaps to the summit thought, the summit light.\nl
For by the form the Formless is brought close\nl
And all perfection fringes the Absolute.\nl
A child of heaven who never saw his home,\nl
Its impetus meets the eternal at a point:\nl
It can only near and touch, it cannot hold;\nl
It can only strain towards some bright extreme:\nl
Its greatness is to seek and to create.\nl
\sparn On every plane, this Greatness must create.\nl
On earth, in heaven, in hell she is the same;\nl
Of every fate she takes her mighty part.\nl
A guardian of the fire that lights the suns,\nl
She triumphs in her glory and her might:\nl
Opposed, oppressed she bears God's urge to be born:\nl
The spirit survives upon non-being's ground,\nl
World-force outlasts world-disillusion's shock:\nl
Dumb, she is still the Word, inert the Power.\nl
Here fallen, a slave of death and ignorance,\nl
To things deathless she is driven to aspire\nl
And moved to know even the Unknowable.\nl
Even nescient, null, her sleep creates a world.\nl
Page 179

When most unseen, most mightily she works;\nl
Housed in the atom, buried in the clod,\nl
Her quick creative passion cannot cease.\nl
Inconscience is her long gigantic pause,\nl
Her cosmic swoon is a stupendous phase:\nl
Time-born, she hides her immortality;\nl
In death, her bed, she waits the hour to rise.\nl
Even with the Light denied that sent her forth\nl
And the hope dead she needed for her task,\nl
Even when her brightest stars are quenched in Night,\nl
Nourished by hardship and calamity\nl
And with pain for her body's handmaid, masseuse, nurse,\nl
Her tortured invisible spirit continues still\nl
To toil though in darkness, to create though with pangs;\nl
She carries crucified God upon her breast.\nl
In chill insentient depths where joy is none,\nl
Immured, oppressed by the resisting Void\nl
Where nothing moves and nothing can become,\nl
Still she remembers, still invokes the skill\nl
The Wonder-worker gave her at her birth,\nl
Imparts to drowsy formlessness a shape,\nl
Reveals a world where nothing was before.\nl
In realms confined to a prone circle of death,\nl
To a dark eternity of Ignorance,\nl
A quiver in an inert inconscient mass,\nl
Or imprisoned in immobilised whorls of Force,\nl
By Matter's blind compulsion deaf and mute\nl
She refuses motionless in the dust to sleep.\nl
Then, for her rebel waking's punishment\nl
Given only hard mechanic Circumstance\nl
As the enginery of her magic craft,\nl
She fashions godlike marvels out of mud;\nl
In the plasm she sets her dumb immortal urge,\nl
Helps the live tissue to think, the closed sense to feel,\nl
Flashes through the frail nerves poignant messages,\nl
In a heart of flesh miraculously loves,\nl
Page 180

To brute bodies gives a soul, a will, a voice.\nl
Ever she summons as by a sorcerer's wand\nl
Beings and shapes and scenes innumerable,\nl
Torch-bearers of her pomps through Time and Space.\nl
This world is her long journey through the night,\nl
The suns and planets lamps to light her road,\nl
Our reason is the confidante of her thoughts,\nl
Our senses are her vibrant witnesses.\nl
There drawing her signs from things half true, half false,\nl
She labours to replace by realised dreams\nl
The memory of her lost eternity.\nl
\sparn These are her deeds in this huge world-ignorance:\nl
Till the veil is lifted, till the night is dead,\nl
In light or dark she keeps her tireless search;\nl
Time is her road of endless pilgrimage.\nl
One mighty passion motives all her works.\nl
Her eternal Lover is her action's cause;\nl
For him she leaped forth from the unseen Vasts\nl
To move here in a stark unconscious world.\nl
Its acts are her commerce with her hidden Guest,\nl
His moods she takes for her heart's passionate moulds;\nl
In beauty she treasures the sunlight of his smile.\nl
Ashamed of her rich cosmic poverty,\nl
She cajoles with her small gifts his mightiness,\nl
Holds with her scenes his look's fidelity\nl
And woos his large-eyed wandering thoughts to dwell\nl
In figures of her million-impulsed Force.\nl
Only to attract her veiled companion\nl
And keep him close to her breast in her world-cloak\nl
Lest from her arms he turn to his formless peace,\nl
Is her heart's business and her clinging care.\nl
Yet when he is most near, she feels him far.\nl
For contradiction is her nature's law.\nl
Although she is ever in him and he in her,\nl
As if unaware of the eternal tie,\nl
Her will is to shut God into her works\nl
Page 181

And keep him as her cherished prisoner\nl
That never they may part again in Time.\nl
A sumptuous chamber of the spirit's sleep\nl
At first she made, a deep interior room,\nl
Where he slumbers as if a forgotten guest.\nl
But now she turns to break the oblivious spell,\nl
Awakes the sleeper on the sculptured couch;\nl
She finds again the Presence in the form\nl
And in the light that wakes with him recovers\nl
A meaning in the hurry and trudge of Time,\nl
And through this mind that once obscured the soul\nl
Passes a glint of unseen deity.\nl
Across a luminous dream of spirit-space\nl
She builds creation like a rainbow bridge\nl
Between the original Silence and the Void.\nl
A net is made of the mobile universe;\nl
She weaves a snare for the conscious Infinite.\nl
A knowledge is with her that conceals its steps\nl
And seems a mute omnipotent Ignorance.\nl
A might is with her that makes wonders true;\nl
The incredible is her stuff of common fact.\nl
Her purposes, her workings riddles prove;\nl
Examined, they grow other than they were,\nl
Explained, they seem yet more inexplicable.\nl
Even in our world a mystery has reigned\nl
Earth's cunning screen of trivial plainness hides;\nl
Her larger levels are of sorceries made.\nl
There the enigma shows its splendid prism,\nl
There is no deep disguise of commonness;\nl
Occult, profound comes all experience,\nl
Marvel is ever new, miracle divine.\nl
There is a screened burden, a mysterious touch,\nl
There is a secrecy of hidden sense.\nl
Although no earthen mask weighs on her face,\nl
Into herself she flees from her own sight.\nl
All forms are tokens of some veiled idea\nl
Page 182

Whose covert purpose lurks from mind's pursuit,\nl
Yet is a womb of sovereign consequence.\nl
There every thought and feeling is an act,\nl
And every act a symbol and a sign,\nl
And every symbol hides a living power.\nl
A universe she builds from truths and myths,\nl
But what she needed most she cannot build;\nl
All shown is a figure or copy of the Truth,\nl
But the Real veils from her its mystic face.\nl
All else she finds, there lacks eternity;\nl
All is sought out, but missed the Infinite.\nl

\spar A consciousness lit by a Truth above\nl
Was felt; it saw the light but not the Truth:\nl
It caught the Idea and built from it a world;\nl
It made an Image there and called it God.\nl
Yet something true and inward harboured there.\nl
The beings of that world of greater life,\nl
Tenants of a larger air and freer space,\nl
Live not by the body or in outward things:\nl
A deeper living was their seat of self.\nl
In that intense domain of intimacy\nl
Objects dwell as companions of the soul;\nl
The body's actions are a minor script,\nl
The surface rendering of a life within.\nl
All forces are Life's retinue in that world\nl
And thought and body as her handmaids move.\nl
The universal widenesses give her room:\nl
All feel the cosmic movement in their acts\nl
And are the instruments of her cosmic might.\nl
Or their own self they make their universe.\nl
In all who have risen to a greater Life,\nl
A voice of unborn things whispers to the ear,\nl
To their eyes visited by some high sunlight\nl
Aspiration shows the image of a crown:\nl
To work out a seed that she has thrown within,\nl
Page 183

To achieve her power in them her creatures live.\nl
Each is a greatness growing towards the heights\nl
Or from his inner centre oceans out;\nl
In circling ripples of concentric power\nl
They swallow, glutted, their environment.\nl
Even of that largeness many a cabin make;\nl
In narrower breadths and briefer vistas pent\nl
They live content with some small greatness won.\nl
To rule the little empire of themselves,\nl
To be a figure in their private world\nl
And make the milieu's joys and griefs their own\nl
And satisfy their life-motives and life-wants\nl
Is charge enough and office for this strength,\nl
A steward of the Person and his fate.\nl
This was transition-line and starting-point,\nl
A first immigration into heavenliness,\nl
For all who cross into that brilliant sphere:\nl
These are the kinsmen of our earthly race;\nl
This region borders on our mortal state.\nl
\sparn This wider world our greater movements gives,\nl
Its strong formations build our growing selves;\nl
Its creatures are our brighter replicas,\nl
Complete the types we only initiate\nl
And are securely what we strive to be.\nl
As if thought-out eternal characters,\nl
Entire, not pulled as we by contrary tides,\nl
They follow the unseen leader in the heart,\nl
Their lives obey the inner nature's law.\nl
There is kept grandeur's store, the hero's mould;\nl
The soul is the watchful builder of its fate;\nl
None is a spirit indifferent and inert;\nl
They choose their side, they see the god they adore.\nl
A battle is joined between the true and false,\nl
A pilgrimage sets out to the divine Light.\nl
For even Ignorance there aspires to know\nl
And shines with the lustre of a distant star;\nl
Page 184

There is a knowledge in the heart of sleep\nl
And Nature comes to them as a conscious force.\nl
An ideal is their leader and their king:\nl
Aspiring to the monarchy of the sun\nl
They call in Truth for their high government,\nl
Hold her incarnate in their daily acts\nl
And fill their thoughts with her inspired voice\nl
And shape their lives into her breathing form,\nl
Till in her sun-gold godhead they too share.\nl
Or to the truth of Darkness they subscribe;\nl
Whether for Heaven or Hell they must wage war:\nl
Warriors of Good, they serve a shining cause\nl
Or are Evil's soldiers in the pay of Sin.\nl
For evil and good an equal tenure keep\nl
Wherever Knowledge is Ignorance's twin.\nl
All powers of Life towards their godhead tend\nl
In the wideness and the daring of that air,\nl
Each builds its temple and expands its cult,\nl
And Sin too there is a divinity.\nl
Affirming the beauty and splendour of her law\nl
She claims life as her natural domain,\nl
Assumes the world's throne or dons the papal robe:\nl
Her worshippers proclaim her sacred right.\nl
A red-tiaraed Falsehood they revere,\nl
Worship the shadow of a crooked God,\nl
Admit the black Idea that twists the brain\nl
Or lie with the harlot Power that slays the soul.\nl
A mastering virtue statuesques the pose,\nl
Or a Titan passion goads to a proud unrest:\nl
At Wisdom's altar they are kings and priests\nl
Or their life a sacrifice to an idol of Power.\nl
Or Beauty shines on them like a wandering star;\nl
Too far to reach, passionate they follow her light;\nl
In Art and life they catch the All-Beautiful's ray\nl
And make the world their radiant treasure house:\nl
Even common figures are with marvel robed;\nl
Page 185

A charm and greatness locked in every hour\nl
Awakes the joy which sleeps in all things made.\nl
A mighty victory or a mighty fall,\nl
A throne in heaven or a pit in hell,\nl
The dual Energy they have justified\nl
And marked their souls with her tremendous seal:\nl
Whatever Fate may do to them they have earned;\nl
Something they have done, something they have been, they live.\nl
There Matter is soul's result and not its cause.\nl
In a contrary balance to earth's truth of things\nl
The gross weighs less, the subtle counts for more;\nl
On inner values hangs the outer plan.\nl
As quivers with the thought the expressive word,\nl
As yearns the act with the passion of the soul\nl
This world's apparent sensible design\nl
Looks vibrant back to some interior might.\nl
A Mind not limited by external sense\nl
Gave figures to the spirit's imponderables,\nl
The world's impacts without channels registered\nl
And turned into the body's concrete thrill\nl
The vivid workings of a bodiless Force;\nl
Powers here subliminal that act unseen\nl
Or in ambush crouch waiting behind the wall\nl
Came out in front uncovering their face.\nl
The occult grew there overt, the obvious kept\nl
A covert turn and shouldered the unknown;\nl
The unseen was felt and jostled visible shapes.\nl
In the communion of two meeting minds\nl
Thought looked at thought and had no need of speech;\nl
Emotion clasped emotion in two hearts,\nl
They felt each other's thrill in the flesh and nerves\nl
Or melted each in each and grew immense\nl
As when two houses burn and fire joins fire:\nl
Hate grappled hate and love broke in on love,\nl
Will wrestled with will on mind's invisible ground;\nl
Others' sensations passing through like waves\nl
Page 186

Left quivering the subtle body's frame,\nl
Their anger rushed galloping in brute attack,\nl
A charge of trampling hooves on shaken soil;\nl
One felt another's grief invade the breast,\nl
Another's joy exulting ran through the blood:\nl
Hearts could draw close through distance, voices near\nl
That spoke upon the shore of alien seas.\nl
There beat a throb of living interchange:\nl
Being felt being even when afar\nl
And consciousness replied to consciousness.\nl
And yet the ultimate oneness was not there.\nl
There was a separateness of soul from soul:\nl
An inner wall of silence could be built,\nl
An armour of conscious might protect and shield;\nl
The being could be closed in and solitary;\nl
One could remain apart in self, alone.\nl
Identity was not yet nor union's peace.\nl
All was imperfect still, half-known, half-done:\nl
The miracle of Inconscience overpassed,\nl
The miracle of the Superconscient still,\nl
Unknown, self-wrapped, unfelt, unknowable,\nl
Looked down on them, origin of all they were.\nl
As forms they came of the formless Infinite,\nl
As names lived of a nameless Eternity.\nl
The beginning and the end were there occult;\nl
A middle term worked unexplained, abrupt:\nl
They were words that spoke to a vast wordless Truth,\nl
They were figures crowding an unfinished sum.\nl
None truly knew himself or knew the world\nl
Or the Reality living there enshrined:\nl
Only they knew what Mind could take and build\nl
Out of the secret Supermind's huge store.\nl
A darkness under them, a bright Void above,\nl
Uncertain they lived in a great climbing Space;\nl
By mysteries they explained a Mystery,\nl
A riddling answer met the riddle of things.\nl
Page 187

As he moved in this ether of ambiguous life,\nl
Himself was soon a riddle to himself;\nl
As symbols he saw all and sought their sense.\nl

\spar Across the leaping springs of death and birth\nl
And over shifting borders of soul-change,\nl
A hunter on the spirit's creative track,\nl
He followed in life's fine and mighty trails\nl
Pursuing her sealed formidable delight\nl
In a perilous adventure without close.\nl
At first no aim appeared in those large steps:\nl
Only the wide source he saw of all things here\nl
Looking towards a wider source beyond.\nl
For as she drew away from earthly lines,\nl
A tenser drag was felt from the Unknown,\nl
A higher context of delivering thought\nl
Drove her towards marvel and discovery;\nl
There came a high release from pettier cares,\nl
A mightier image of desire and hope,\nl
A vaster formula, a greater scene.\nl
Ever she circled towards some far-off Light:\nl
Her signs still covered more than they revealed;\nl
But tied to some immediate sight and will\nl
They lost their purport in the joy of use,\nl
Till stripped of their infinite meaning they became\nl
A cipher gleaming with unreal sense.\nl
Armed with a magical and haunted bow\nl
She aimed at a target kept invisible\nl
And ever deemed remote though always near.\nl
As one who spells illumined characters,\nl
The key-book of a crabbed magician text,\nl
He scanned her subtle tangled weird designs\nl
And the screened difficult theorem of her clues,\nl
Traced in the monstrous sands of desert Time\nl
The thread beginnings of her titan works,\nl
Watched her charade of action for some hint,\nl
Page 188

Read the N\=o-gestures of her silhouettes,\nl
And strove to capture in their burdened drift\nl
The dance-fantasia of her sequences\nl
Escaping into rhythmic mystery,\nl
A glimmer of fugitive feet on fleeing soil.\nl
In the labyrinth pattern of her thoughts and hopes\nl
And the byways of her intimate desires,\nl
In the complex corners crowded with her dreams\nl
And rounds crossed by an intrigue of irrelevant rounds,\nl
A wanderer straying amid fugitive scenes,\nl
He lost its signs and chased each failing guess.\nl
Ever he met key-words, ignorant of their key.\nl
A sun that dazzled its own eye of sight,\nl
A luminous enigma's brilliant hood\nl
Lit the dense purple barrier of thought's sky:\nl
A dim large trance showed to the night her stars.\nl
As if sitting near an open window's gap,\nl
He read by lightning-flash on crowding flash\nl
Chapters of her metaphysical romance\nl
Of the soul's search for lost Reality\nl
And her fictions drawn from spirit's authentic fact,\nl
Her caprices and conceits and meanings locked,\nl
Her rash unseizable freaks and mysteried turns.\nl
The magnificent wrappings of her secrecy\nl
That fold her desirable body out of sight,\nl
The strange significant forms woven on her robe,\nl
Her meaningful outlines of the souls of things\nl
He saw, her false transparencies of thought-hue,\nl
Her rich brocades with imaged fancies sewn\nl
And mutable masks and broideries of disguise.\nl
A thousand baffling faces of the Truth\nl
Looked at him from her forms with unknown eyes\nl
And wordless mouths unrecognisable,\nl
Spoke from the figures of her masquerade,\nl
Or peered from the recondite magnificence\nl
And subtle splendour of her draperies.\nl
Page 189

In sudden scintillations of the Unknown,\nl
Inexpressive sounds became veridical,\nl
Ideas that seemed unmeaning flashed out truth;\nl
Voices that came from unseen waiting worlds\nl
Uttered the syllables of the Unmanifest\nl
To clothe the body of the mystic Word,\nl
And wizard diagrams of the occult Law\nl
Sealed some precise unreadable harmony,\nl
Or used hue and figure to reconstitute\nl
The herald blazon of Time's secret things.\nl
In her green wildernesses and lurking depths,\nl
In her thickets of joy where danger clasps delight,\nl
He glimpsed the hidden wings of her songster hopes,\nl
A glimmer of blue and gold and scarlet fire.\nl
In her covert lanes, bordering her chance field-paths\nl
And by her singing rivulets and calm lakes\nl
He found the glow of her golden fruits of bliss\nl
And the beauty of her flowers of dream and muse.\nl
As if a miracle of heart's change by joy\nl
He watched in the alchemist radiance of her suns\nl
The crimson outburst of one secular flower\nl
On the tree-of-sacrifice of spiritual love.\nl
In the sleepy splendour of her noons he saw,\nl
A perpetual repetition through the hours,\nl
Thought's dance of dragonflies on mystery's stream\nl
That skim but never test its murmurs' race,\nl
And heard the laughter of her rose desires\nl
Running as if to escape from longed-for hands,\nl
Jingling sweet anklet-bells of fantasy.\nl
Amidst live symbols of her occult power\nl
He moved and felt them as close real forms:\nl
In that life more concrete than the lives of men\nl
Throbbed heart-beats of the hidden reality:\nl
Embodied was there what we but think and feel,\nl
Self-framed what here takes outward borrowed shapes.\nl
A comrade of Silence on her austere heights\nl
Page 190

Accepted by her mighty loneliness,\nl
He stood with her on meditating peaks\nl
Where life and being are a sacrament\nl
Offered to the Reality beyond,\nl
And saw her loose into infinity\nl
Her hooded eagles of significance,\nl
Messengers of Thought to the Unknowable.\nl
Identified in soul-vision and soul-sense,\nl
Entering into her depths as into a house,\nl
All he became that she was or longed to be,\nl
He thought with her thoughts and journeyed with her steps,\nl
Lived with her breath and scanned all with her eyes\nl
That so he might learn the secret of her soul.\nl
A witness overmastered by his scene,\nl
He admired her splendid front of pomp and play\nl
And the marvels of her rich and delicate craft,\nl
And thrilled to the insistence of her cry;\nl
Impassioned he bore the sorceries of her might,\nl
Felt laid on him her abrupt mysterious will,\nl
Her hands that knead fate in their violent grasp,\nl
Her touch that moves, her powers that seize and drive.\nl
But this too he saw, her soul that wept within,\nl
Her seekings vain that clutch at fleeing truth,\nl
Her hopes whose sombre gaze mates with despair,\nl
The passion that possessed her longing limbs,\nl
The trouble and rapture of her yearning breasts,\nl
Her mind that toils unsatisfied with its fruits,\nl
Her heart that captures not the one Beloved.\nl
Always he met a veiled and seeking Force,\nl
An exiled goddess building mimic heavens,\nl
A Sphinx whose eyes look up to a hidden Sun.\nl

\spar Ever he felt near a spirit in her forms:\nl
Its passive presence was her nature's strength;\nl
This sole is real in apparent things,\nl
Even upon earth the spirit is life's key,\nl
Page 191

But her solid outsides nowhere bear its trace.\nl
Its stamp on her acts is undiscoverable.\nl
A pathos of lost heights is its appeal.\nl
Only sometimes is caught a shadowy line\nl
That seems a hint of veiled reality.\nl
Life stared at him with vague confused outlines\nl
Offering a picture the eyes could not keep,\nl
A story that was yet not written there.\nl
As in a fragmentary half-lost design\nl
Life's meanings fled from the pursuing eye.\nl
Life's visage hides life's real self from sight;\nl
Life's secret sense is written within, above.\nl
The thought that gives it sense lives far beyond;\nl
It is not seen in its half-finished design.\nl
In vain we hope to read the baffling signs\nl
Or find the word of the half-played charade.\nl
Only in that greater life a cryptic thought\nl
Is found, is hinted some interpreting word\nl
That makes the earth-myth a tale intelligible.\nl
Something was seen at last that looked like truth.\nl
In a half-lit air of hazardous mystery\nl
The eye that looks at the dark half of truth\nl
Made out an image mid a vivid blur\nl
And peering through a mist of subtle tints\nl
He saw a half-blind chained divinity\nl
Bewildered by the world in which he moved,\nl
Yet conscious of some light prompting his soul.\nl
Attracted to strange far-off shimmerings,\nl
Led by the fluting of a distant Player\nl
He sought his way amid life's laughter and call\nl
And the index chaos of her myriad steps\nl
Towards some total deep infinitude.\nl
Around crowded the forest of her signs:\nl
At hazard he read by arrow-leaps of Thought\nl
That hit the mark by guess or luminous chance,\nl
Her changing coloured road-lights of idea\nl
Page 192

And her signals of uncertain swift event,\nl
The hieroglyphs of her symbol pageantries\nl
And her landmarks in the tangled paths of Time.\nl
In her mazes of approach and of retreat\nl
To every side she draws him and repels,\nl
But drawn too near escapes from his embrace;\nl
All ways she leads him but no way is sure.\nl
Allured by the many-toned marvel of her chant,\nl
Attracted by the witchcraft of her moods\nl
And moved by her casual touch to joy and grief,\nl
He loses himself in her but wins her not.\nl
A fugitive paradise smiles at him from her eyes:\nl
He dreams of her beauty made for ever his,\nl
He dreams of his mastery her limbs shall bear,\nl
He dreams of the magic of her breasts of bliss.\nl
In her illumined script, her fanciful\nl
Translation of God's pure original text,\nl
He thinks to read the Scripture Wonderful,\nl
Hieratic key to unknown beatitudes.\nl
But the Word of Life is hidden in its script,\nl
The chant of Life has lost its divine note.\nl
Unseen, a captive in a house of sound,\nl
The spirit lost in the splendour of a dream\nl
Listens to a thousand-voiced illusion's ode.\nl
A delicate weft of sorcery steals the heart\nl
Or a fiery magic tints her tones and hues,\nl
Yet they but wake a thrill of transient grace;\nl
A vagrant march struck by the wanderer Time,\nl
They call to a brief unsatisfied delight\nl
Or wallow in ravishments of mind and sense,\nl
But miss the luminous answer of the soul.\nl
A blind heart-throb that reaches joy through tears,\nl
A yearning towards peaks for ever unreached,\nl
An ecstasy of unfulfilled desire\nl
Track the last heavenward climbings of her voice.\nl
Transmuted are past suffering's memories\nl
Page 193

Into an old sadness's sweet escaping trail:\nl
Turned are her tears to gems of diamond pain,\nl
Her sorrow into a magic crown of song.\nl
Brief are her snatches of felicity\nl
That touch the surface, then escape or die:\nl
A lost remembrance echoes in her depths,\nl
A deathless longing is hers, a veiled self's call;\nl
A prisoner in the mortal's limiting world,\nl
A spirit wounded by life sobs in her breast;\nl
A cherished suffering is her deepest cry.\nl
A wanderer on forlorn despairing routes,\nl
Along the roads of sound a frustrate voice\nl
Forsaken cries to a forgotten bliss.\nl
Astray in the echo caverns of Desire,\nl
It guards the phantoms of a soul's dead hopes\nl
And keeps alive the voice of perished things\nl
Or lingers upon sweet and errant notes\nl
Hunting for pleasure in the heart of pain.\nl
A fateful hand has touched the cosmic chords\nl
And the intrusion of a troubled strain\nl
Covers the inner music's hidden key\nl
That guides unheard the surface cadences.\nl
Yet is it joy to live and to create\nl
And joy to love and labour though all fails,\nl
And joy to seek though all we find deceives\nl
And all on which we lean betrays our trust;\nl
Yet something in its depths was worth the pain,\nl
A passionate memory haunts with ecstasy's fire.\nl
Even grief has joy hidden beneath its roots:\nl
For nothing is truly vain the One has made:\nl
In our defeated hearts God's strength survives\nl
And victory's star still lights our desperate road;\nl
Our death is made a passage to new worlds.\nl
This to Life's music gives its anthem swell.\nl
To all she lends the glory of her voice;\nl
Heaven's raptures whisper to her heart and pass,\nl
Page 194

Earth's transient yearnings cry from her lips and fade.\nl
Alone the God-given hymn escapes her art\nl
That came with her from her spiritual home\nl
But stopped half-way and failed, a silent word\nl
Awake in some deep pause of waiting worlds,\nl
A murmur suspended in eternity's hush:\nl
But no breath comes from the supernal peace:\nl
A sumptuous interlude occupies the ear\nl
And the heart listens and the soul consents;\nl
An evanescent music it repeats\nl
Wasting on transience Time's eternity.\nl
A tremolo of the voices of the hours\nl
Oblivious screens the high intended theme\nl
The self-embodying spirit came to play\nl
On the vast clavichord of Nature-Force.\nl
Only a mighty murmur here and there\nl
Of the eternal Word, the blissful Voice\nl
Or Beauty's touch transfiguring heart and sense,\nl
A wandering splendour and a mystic cry,\nl
Recalls the strength and sweetness heard no more.\nl

\spar Here is the gap, here stops or sinks life's force;\nl
This deficit paupers the magician's skill:\nl
This want makes all the rest seem thin and bare.\nl
A half-sight draws the horizon of her acts:\nl
Her depths remember what she came to do,\nl
But the mind has forgotten or the heart mistakes:\nl
In Nature's endless lines is lost the God.\nl
In knowledge to sum up omniscience,\nl
In action to erect the Omnipotent,\nl
To create her Creator here was her heart's conceit,\nl
To invade the cosmic scene with utter God.\nl
Toiling to transform the still far Absolute\nl
Into an all-fulfilling epiphany,\nl
Into an utterance of the Ineffable,\nl
She would bring the glory here of the Absolute's force,\nl
Page 195

Change poise into creation's rhythmic swing,\nl
Marry with a sky of calm a sea of bliss.\nl
A fire to call eternity into Time,\nl
Make body's joy as vivid as the soul's,\nl
Earth she would lift to neighbourhood with heaven,\nl
Labours life to equate with the Supreme\nl
And reconcile the Eternal and the Abyss.\nl
Her pragmatism of the transcendent Truth\nl
Fills silence with the voices of the gods,\nl
But in the cry the single Voice is lost.\nl
For Nature's vision climbs beyond her acts.\nl
A life of gods in heaven she sees above,\nl
A demigod emerging from an ape\nl
Is all she can in our mortal element.\nl
Here the half-god, the half-titan are her peak:\nl
This greater life wavers twixt earth and sky.\nl
A poignant paradox pursues her dreams:\nl
Her hooded energy moves an ignorant world\nl
To look for a joy her own strong clasp puts off:\nl
In her embrace it cannot turn to its source.\nl
Immense her power, endless her act's vast drive,\nl
Astray is its significance and lost.\nl
Although she carries in her secret breast\nl
The law and journeying curve of all things born\nl
Her knowledge partial seems, her purpose small;\nl
On a soil of yearning tread her sumptuous hours.\nl
A leaden Nescience weighs the wings of Thought,\nl
Her power oppresses the being with its garbs,\nl
Her actions prison its immortal gaze.\nl
A sense of limit haunts her masteries\nl
And nowhere is assured content or peace:\nl
For all the depth and beauty of her work\nl
A wisdom lacks that sets the spirit free.\nl
An old and faded charm had now her face\nl
And palled for him her quick and curious lore;\nl
His wide soul asked a deeper joy than hers.\nl
Page 196

Out of her daedal lines he sought escape;\nl
But neither gate of horn nor ivory\nl
He found nor postern of spiritual sight,\nl
There was no issue from that dreamlike space.\nl
Our being must move eternally through Time;\nl
Death helps us not, vain is the hope to cease;\nl
A secret Will compels us to endure.\nl
Our life's repose is in the Infinite;\nl
It cannot end, its end is Life supreme.\nl
Death is a passage, not the goal of our walk:\nl
Some ancient deep impulsion labours on:\nl
Our souls are dragged as with a hidden leash,\nl
Carried from birth to birth, from world to world,\nl
Our acts prolong after the body's fall\nl
The old perpetual journey without pause.\nl
No silent peak is found where Time can rest.\nl
This was a magic stream that reached no sea.\nl
However far he went, wherever turned,\nl
The wheel of works ran with him and outstripped;\nl
Always a farther task was left to do.\nl
A beat of action and a cry of search\nl
For ever grew in that unquiet world;\nl
A busy murmur filled the heart of Time.\nl
All was contrivance and unceasing stir.\nl
A hundred ways to live were tried in vain:\nl
A sameness that assumed a thousand forms\nl
Strove to escape from its long monotone\nl
And made new things that soon were like the old.\nl
A curious decoration lured the eye\nl
And novel values furbished ancient themes\nl
To cheat the mind with the idea of change.\nl
A different picture that was still the same\nl
Appeared upon the cosmic vague background.\nl
Only another labyrinthine house\nl
Of creatures and their doings and events,\nl
A city of the traffic of bound souls,\nl
Page 197

A market of creation and her wares,\nl
Was offered to the labouring mind and heart.\nl
A circuit ending where it first began\nl
Is dubbed the forward and eternal march\nl
Of progress on perfection's unknown road.\nl
Each final scheme leads to a sequel plan.\nl
Yet every new departure seems the last,\nl
Inspired evangel, theory's ultimate peak,\nl
Proclaiming a panacea for all Time's ills\nl
Or carrying thought in its ultimate zenith flight\nl
And trumpeting supreme discovery;\nl
Each brief idea, a structure perishable,\nl
Publishes the immortality of its rule,\nl
Its claim to be the perfect form of things,\nl
Truth's last epitome, Time's golden best.\nl
But nothing has been achieved of infinite worth:\nl
A world made ever anew, never complete,\nl
Piled always half-attempts on lost attempts\nl
And saw a fragment as the eternal Whole.\nl
In the aimless mounting total of things done\nl
Existence seemed a vain necessity's act,\nl
A wrestle of eternal opposites\nl
In a clasped antagonism's close-locked embrace,\nl
A play without denouement or idea,\nl
A hunger march of lives without a goal,\nl
Or, written on a bare blackboard of Space,\nl
A futile and recurring sum of souls,\nl
A hope that failed, a light that never shone,\nl
The labour of an unaccomplished Force\nl
Tied to its acts in a dim eternity.\nl
There is no end or none can yet be seen:\nl
Although defeated, life must struggle on;\nl
Always she sees a crown she cannot grasp;\nl
Her eyes are fixed beyond her fallen state.\nl
There quivers still within her breast and ours\nl
A glory that was once and is no more,\nl
Page 198

Or there calls to us from some unfulfilled beyond\nl
A greatness yet unreached by the halting world.\nl
In a memory behind our mortal sense\nl
A dream persists of larger happier air\nl
Breathing around free hearts of joy and love,\nl
Forgotten by us, immortal in lost Time.\nl
A ghost of bliss pursues her haunted depths;\nl
For she remembers still, though now so far,\nl
Her realm of golden ease and glad desire\nl
And the beauty and strength and happiness that were hers\nl
In the sweetness of her glowing paradise,\nl
In her kingdom of immortal ecstasy\nl
Half-way between God's silence and the Abyss.\nl
This knowledge in our hidden parts we keep;\nl
Awake to a vague mystery's appeal,\nl
We meet a deep unseen Reality\nl
Far truer than the world's face of present truth:\nl
We are chased by a self we cannot now recall\nl
And moved by a Spirit we must still become.\nl
As one who has lost the kingdom of his soul,\nl
We look back to some god-phase of our birth\nl
Other than this imperfect creature here\nl
And hope in this or a diviner world\nl
To recover yet from Heaven's patient guard\nl
What by our mind's forgetfulness we miss,\nl
Our being's natural felicity,\nl
Our heart's delight we have exchanged for grief,\nl
The body's thrill we bartered for mere pain,\nl
The bliss for which our mortal nature yearns\nl
As yearns an obscure moth to blazing Light.\nl
Our life is a march to a victory never won.\nl
This wave of being longing for delight,\nl
This eager turmoil of unsatisfied strengths,\nl
These long far files of forward-striving hopes\nl
Lift worshipping eyes to the blue Void called heaven\nl
Looking for the golden Hand that never came,\nl
Page 199

The advent for which all creation waits,\nl
The beautiful visage of Eternity\nl
That shall appear upon the roads of Time.\nl
Yet still to ourselves we say rekindling faith,\nl
“Oh, surely one day he shall come to our cry,\nl
One day he shall create our life anew\nl
And utter the magic formula of peace\nl
And bring perfection to the scheme of things.\nl
One day he shall descend to life and earth,\nl
Leaving the secrecy of the eternal doors,\nl
Into a world that cries to him for help,\nl
And bring the truth that sets the spirit free,\nl
The joy that is the baptism of the soul,\nl
The strength that is the outstretched arm of Love.\nl
One day he shall lift his beauty's dreadful veil,\nl
Impose delight on the world's beating heart\nl
And bare his secret body of light and bliss.”\nl
But now we strain to reach an unknown goal:\nl
There is no end of seeking and of birth,\nl
There is no end of dying and return;\nl
The life that wins its aim asks greater aims,\nl
The life that fails and dies must live again;\nl
Till it has found itself it cannot cease.\nl
All must be done for which life and death were made.\nl
But who shall say that even then is rest?\nl
Or there repose and action are the same\nl
In the deep breast of God's supreme delight.\nl
In a high state where ignorance is no more,\nl
Each movement is a wave of peace and bliss,\nl
Repose God's motionless creative force,\nl
Action a ripple in the Infinite\nl
And birth a gesture of Eternity.\nl
A sun of transfiguration still can shine\nl
And Night can bare its core of mystic light;\nl
The self-cancelling, self-afflicting paradox\nl
Into a self-luminous mystery might change,\nl
Page 200

The imbroglio into a joyful miracle.\nl
Then God could be visible here, here take a shape;\nl
Disclosed would be the spirit's identity;\nl
Life would reveal her true immortal face.\nl
But now a termless labour is her fate:\nl
In its recurrent decimal of events\nl
Birth, death are a ceaseless iteration's points;\nl
The old question-mark margins each finished page,\nl
Each volume of her effort's history.\nl
A limping Yes through the aeons journeys still\nl
Accompanied by an eternal No.\nl
All seems in vain, yet endless is the game.\nl
Impassive turns the ever-circling Wheel,\nl
Life has no issue, death brings no release.\nl
A prisoner of itself the being lives\nl
And keeps its futile immortality;\nl
Extinction is denied, its sole escape.\nl
An error of the gods has made the world.\nl
Or indifferent the Eternal watches Time.\nl

\ht Canto Seven: The Descent into Night
\par
\sbigcap A mind absolved from life, made calm to know,\nl
A heart divorced from the blindness and the pang,\nl
The seal of tears, the bond of ignorance,\nl
He turned to find that wide world-failure's cause.\nl
Away he looked from Nature's visible face\nl
And sent his gaze into the viewless Vast,\nl
The formidable unknown Infinity,\nl
Asleep behind the endless coil of things,\nl
That carries the universe in its timeless breadths\nl
And the ripples of its being are our lives.\nl
The worlds are built by its unconscious Breath\nl
And Matter and Mind are its figures or its powers,\nl
Our waking thoughts the output of its dreams.\nl
The veil was rent that covers Nature's depths:\nl
He saw the fount of the world's lasting pain\nl
And the mouth of the black pit of Ignorance;\nl
The evil guarded at the roots of life\nl
Raised up its head and looked into his eyes.\nl
On a dim bank where dies subjective Space,\nl
From a stark ridge overlooking all that is,\nl
A tenebrous awakened Nescience,\nl
Her wide blank eyes wondering at Time and Form,\nl
Stared at the inventions of the living Void\nl
And the Abyss whence our beginnings rose.\nl
Behind appeared a grey carved mask of Night\nl
Watching the birth of all created things.\nl
A hidden Puissance conscious of its force,\nl
A vague and lurking Presence everywhere,\nl
A contrary Doom that threatens all things made,\nl
A Death figuring as the dark seed of life,\nl
Seemed to engender and to slay the world.\nl
Page 202

Then from the sombre mystery of the gulfs\nl
And from the hollow bosom of the Mask\nl
Something crept forth that seemed a shapeless Thought.\nl
A fatal Influence upon creatures stole\nl
Whose lethal touch pursued the immortal spirit,\nl
On life was laid the haunting finger of death\nl
And overcast with error, grief and pain\nl
The soul's native will for truth and joy and light.\nl
A deformation coiled that claimed to be\nl
The being's very turn, Nature's true drive.\nl
A hostile and perverting Mind at work\nl
In every corner ensconced of conscious life\nl
Corrupted Truth with her own formulas;\nl
Interceptor of the listening of the soul,\nl
Afflicting knowledge with the hue of doubt\nl
It captured the oracles of the occult gods,\nl
Effaced the signposts of Life's pilgrimage,\nl
Cancelled the firm rock-edicts graved by Time,\nl
And on the foundations of the cosmic Law\nl
Erected its bronze pylons of misrule.\nl
Even Light and Love by that cloaked danger's spell\nl
Turned from the brilliant nature of the gods\nl
To fallen angels and misleading suns,\nl
Became themselves a danger and a charm,\nl
A perverse sweetness, heaven-born malefice:\nl
Its power could deform divinest things.\nl
A wind of sorrow breathed upon the world;\nl
All thought with falsehood was besieged, all act\nl
Stamped with defect or with frustration's sign,\nl
All high attempt with failure or vain success,\nl
But none could know the reason of his fall.\nl
The grey Mask whispered and, though no sound was heard,\nl
Yet in the ignorant heart a seed was sown\nl
That bore black fruit of suffering, death and bale.\nl
Out of the chill steppes of a bleak Unseen\nl
Invisible, wearing the Night's grey mask,\nl
Page 203

Arrived the shadowy dreadful messengers,\nl
Invaders from a dangerous world of power,\nl
Ambassadors of evil's absolute.\nl
In silence the inaudible voices spoke,\nl
Hands that none saw planted the fatal grain,\nl
No form was seen, yet a dire work was done,\nl
An iron decree in crooked uncials written\nl
Imposed a law of sin and adverse fate.\nl
Life looked at him with changed and sombre eyes:\nl
Her beauty he saw and the yearning heart in things\nl
That with a little happiness is content,\nl
Answering to a small ray of truth or love;\nl
He saw her gold sunlight and her far blue sky,\nl
Her green of leaves and hue and scent of flowers\nl
And the charm of children and the love of friends\nl
And the beauty of women and kindly hearts of men,\nl
But saw too the dreadful Powers that drive her moods\nl
And the anguish she has strewn upon her ways,\nl
Fate waiting on the unseen steps of men\nl
And her evil and sorrow and last gift of death.\nl
A breath of disillusion and decadence\nl
Corrupting watched for Life's maturity\nl
And made to rot the full grain of the soul:\nl
Progress became a purveyor of Death.\nl
A world that clung to the law of a slain Light\nl
Cherished the putrid corpses of dead truths,\nl
Hailed twisted forms as things free, new and true,\nl
Beauty from ugliness and evil drank\nl
Feeling themselves guests at a banquet of the gods\nl
And tasted corruption like a high-spiced food.\nl
A darkness settled on the heavy air;\nl
It hunted the bright smile from Nature's lips\nl
And slew the native confidence in her heart\nl
And put fear's crooked look into her eyes.\nl
The lust that warps the spirit's natural good\nl
Replaced by a manufactured virtue and vice\nl
Page 204

The frank spontaneous impulse of the soul:\nl
Afflicting Nature with the dual's lie,\nl
Their twin values whetted a forbidden zest,\nl
Made evil a relief from spurious good,\nl
The ego battened on righteousness and sin\nl
And each became an instrument of Hell.\nl
In rejected heaps by a monotonous road\nl
The old simple delights were left to lie\nl
On the wasteland of life's descent to Night.\nl
All glory of life was dimmed, tarnished with doubt;\nl
All beauty ended in an aging face;\nl
All power was dubbed a tyranny cursed by God\nl
And Truth a fiction needed by the mind:\nl
The chase of joy was now a tired hunt;\nl
All knowledge was left a questioning Ignorance.\nl

\spar As from a womb obscure he saw emerge\nl
The body and visage of a dark Unseen\nl
Hidden behind the fair outsides of life.\nl
Its dangerous commerce is our suffering's cause.\nl
Its breath is a subtle poison in men's hearts;\nl
All evil starts from that ambiguous face.\nl
A peril haunted now the common air;\nl
The world grew full of menacing Energies,\nl
And wherever turned for help or hope his eyes,\nl
In field and house, in street and camp and mart\nl
He met the prowl and stealthy come and go\nl
Of armed disquieting bodied Influences.\nl
A march of goddess figures dark and nude\nl
Alarmed the air with grandiose unease;\nl
Appalling footsteps drew invisibly near,\nl
Shapes that were threats invaded the dream-light,\nl
And ominous beings passed him on the road\nl
Whose very gaze was a calamity:\nl
A charm and sweetness sudden and formidable,\nl
Faces that raised alluring lips and eyes\nl
Page 205

Approached him armed with beauty like a snare,\nl
But hid a fatal meaning in each line\nl
And could in a moment dangerously change.\nl
But he alone discerned that screened attack.\nl
A veil upon the inner vision lay,\nl
A force was there that hid its dreadful steps;\nl
All was belied, yet thought itself the truth;\nl
All were beset but knew not of the siege:\nl
For none could see the authors of their fall.\nl
\sparn Aware of some dark wisdom still withheld\nl
That was the seal and warrant of this strength,\nl
He followed the track of dim tremendous steps\nl
Returning to the night from which they came.\nl
A tract he reached unbuilt and owned by none:\nl
There all could enter but none stay for long.\nl
It was a no man's land of evil air,\nl
A crowded neighbourhood without one home,\nl
A borderland between the world and hell.\nl
There unreality was Nature's lord:\nl
It was a space where nothing could be true,\nl
For nothing was what it had claimed to be:\nl
A high appearance wrapped a specious void.\nl
Yet nothing would confess its own pretence\nl
Even to itself in the ambiguous heart:\nl
A vast deception was the law of things;\nl
Only by that deception they could live.\nl
An unsubstantial Nihil guaranteed\nl
The falsehood of the forms this Nature took\nl
And made them seem awhile to be and live.\nl
A borrowed magic drew them from the Void;\nl
They took a shape and stuff that was not theirs\nl
And showed a colour that they could not keep,\nl
Mirrors to a phantasm of reality.\nl
Each rainbow brilliance was a splendid lie;\nl
A beauty unreal graced a glamour face.\nl
Nothing could be relied on to remain:\nl
Page 206

Joy nurtured tears and good an evil proved,\nl
But never out of evil one plucked good:\nl
Love ended early in hate, delight killed with pain,\nl
Truth into falsity grew and death ruled life.\nl
A Power that laughed at the mischiefs of the world,\nl
An irony that joined the world's contraries\nl
And flung them into each other's arms to strive,\nl
Put a sardonic rictus on God's face.\nl
Aloof, its influence entered everywhere\nl
And left a cloven hoof-mark on the breast;\nl
A twisted heart and a strange sombre smile\nl
Mocked at the sinister comedy of life.\nl
Announcing the advent of a perilous Form\nl
An ominous tread softened its dire footfall\nl
That none might understand or be on guard;\nl
None heard until a dreadful grasp was close.\nl
Or else all augured a divine approach,\nl
An air of prophecy felt, a heavenly hope,\nl
Listened for a gospel, watched for a new star.\nl
The Fiend was visible but cloaked in light;\nl
He seemed a helping angel from the skies:\nl
He armed untruth with Scripture and the Law;\nl
He deceived with wisdom, with virtue slew the soul\nl
And led to perdition by the heavenward path.\nl
A lavish sense he gave of power and joy,\nl
And, when arose the warning from within,\nl
He reassured the ear with dulcet tones\nl
Or took the mind captive in its own net;\nl
His rigorous logic made the false seem true.\nl
Amazing the elect with holy lore\nl
He spoke as with the very voice of God.\nl
The air was full of treachery and ruse;\nl
Truth-speaking was a stratagem in that place;\nl
Ambush lurked in a smile and peril made\nl
Safety its cover, trust its entry's gate:\nl
Falsehood came laughing with the eyes of truth;\nl
Page 207

Each friend might turn an enemy or spy,\nl
The hand one clasped ensleeved a dagger's stab\nl
And an embrace could be Doom's iron cage.\nl
Agony and danger stalked their trembling prey\nl
And softly spoke as to a timid friend:\nl
Attack sprang suddenly vehement and unseen;\nl
Fear leaped upon the heart at every turn\nl
And cried out with an anguished dreadful voice;\nl
It called for one to save but none came near.\nl
All warily walked, for death was ever close;\nl
Yet caution seemed a vain expense of care,\nl
For all that guarded proved a deadly net,\nl
And when after long suspense salvation came\nl
And brought a glad relief disarming strength,\nl
It served as a smiling passage to worse fate.\nl
There was no truce and no safe place to rest;\nl
One dared not slumber or put off one's arms:\nl
It was a world of battle and surprise.\nl
All who were there lived for themselves alone;\nl
All warred against all, but with a common hate\nl
Turned on the mind that sought some higher good;\nl
Truth was exiled lest she should dare to speak\nl
And hurt the heart of darkness with her light\nl
Or bring her pride of knowledge to blaspheme\nl
The settled anarchy of established things.\nl

\spar Then the scene changed, but kept its dreadful core:\nl
Altering its form the life remained the same.\nl
A capital was there without a State:\nl
It had no ruler, only groups that strove.\nl
He saw a city of ancient Ignorance\nl
Founded upon a soil that knew not Light.\nl
There each in his own darkness walked alone:\nl
Only they agreed to differ in Evil's paths,\nl
To live in their own way for their own selves\nl
Or to enforce a common lie and wrong;\nl
Page 208

There Ego was lord upon his peacock seat\nl
And Falsehood sat by him, his mate and queen:\nl
The world turned to them as Heaven to Truth and God.\nl
Injustice justified by firm decrees\nl
The sovereign weights of Error's legalised trade,\nl
But all the weights were false and none the same;\nl
Ever she watched with her balance and a sword,\nl
Lest any sacrilegious word expose\nl
The sanctified formulas of her old misrule.\nl
In high professions wrapped self-will walked wide\nl
And licence stalked prating of order and right:\nl
There was no altar raised to Liberty;\nl
True freedom was abhorred and hunted down:\nl
Harmony and tolerance nowhere could be seen;\nl
Each group proclaimed its dire and naked Law.\nl
A frame of ethics knobbed with scriptural rules\nl
Or a theory passionately believed and praised\nl
A table seemed of high Heaven's sacred code.\nl
A formal practice mailed and iron-shod\nl
Gave to a rude and ruthless warrior kind\nl
Drawn from the savage bowels of the earth\nl
A proud stern poise of harsh nobility,\nl
A civic posture rigid and formidable.\nl
But all their private acts belied the pose:\nl
Power and utility were their Truth and Right,\nl
An eagle rapacity clawed its coveted good,\nl
Beaks pecked and talons tore all weaker prey.\nl
In their sweet secrecy of pleasant sins\nl
Nature they obeyed and not a moralist God.\nl
Inconscient traders in bundles of contraries,\nl
They did what in others they would persecute;\nl
When their eyes looked upon their fellow's vice,\nl
An indignation flamed, a virtuous wrath;\nl
Oblivious of their own deep-hid offence,\nl
Moblike they stoned a neighbour caught in sin.\nl
A pragmatist judge within passed false decrees,\nl
Page 209

Posed worst iniquities on equity's base,\nl
Reasoned ill actions just, sanctioned the scale\nl
Of the merchant ego's interest and desire.\nl
Thus was a balance kept, the world could live.\nl
A zealot fervour pushed their ruthless cults,\nl
All faith not theirs bled scourged as heresy;\nl
They questioned, captived, tortured, burned or smote\nl
And forced the soul to abandon right or die.\nl
Amid her clashing creeds and warring sects\nl
Religion sat upon a blood-stained throne.\nl
A hundred tyrannies oppressed and slew\nl
And founded unity upon fraud and force.\nl
Only what seemed was prized as real there:\nl
The ideal was a cynic ridicule's butt;\nl
Hooted by the crowd, mocked by enlightened wits,\nl
Spiritual seeking wandered outcasted,—\nl
A dreamer's self-deceiving web of thought\nl
Or mad chimaera deemed or hypocrite's fake,\nl
Its passionate instinct trailed through minds obscure\nl
Lost in the circuits of the Ignorance.\nl
A lie was there the truth and truth a lie.\nl
Here must the traveller of the upward Way—\nl
For daring Hell's kingdoms winds the heavenly route—\nl
Pause or pass slowly through that perilous space,\nl
A prayer upon his lips and the great Name.\nl
If probed not all discernment's keen spear-point,\nl
He might stumble into falsity's endless net.\nl
Over his shoulder often he must look back\nl
Like one who feels on his neck an enemy's breath;\nl
Else stealing up behind a treasonous blow\nl
Might prostrate cast and pin to unholy soil,\nl
Pierced through his back by Evil's poignant stake.\nl
So might one fall on the Eternal's road\nl
Forfeiting the spirit's lonely chance in Time\nl
And no news of him reach the waiting gods,\nl
Marked “missing” in the register of souls,\nl
Page 210

His name the index of a failing hope,\nl
The position of a dead remembered star.\nl
Only were safe who kept God in their hearts:\nl
Courage their armour, faith their sword, they must walk,\nl
The hand ready to smite, the eye to scout,\nl
Casting a javelin regard in front,\nl
Heroes and soldiers of the army of Light.\nl
Hardly even so, the grisly danger past,\nl
Released into a calmer purer air,\nl
They dared at length to breathe and smile once more.\nl
Once more they moved beneath a real sun.\nl
Though Hell claimed rule, the spirit still had power.\nl
This No-man's-land he passed without debate;\nl
Him the heights missioned, him the Abyss desired:\nl
None stood across his way, no voice forbade.\nl
For swift and easy is the downward path,\nl
And now towards the Night was turned his face.\nl

\spar A greater darkness waited, a worse reign,\nl
If worse can be where all is evil's extreme;\nl
Yet to the cloaked the uncloaked is naked worst.\nl
There God and Truth and the supernal Light\nl
Had never been or else had power no more.\nl
As when one slips in a deep moment's trance\nl
Over mind's border into another world,\nl
He crossed a boundary whose stealthy trace\nl
Eye could not see but only the soul feel.\nl
Into an armoured fierce domain he came\nl
And saw himself wandering like a lost soul\nl
Amid grimed walls and savage slums of Night.\nl
Around him crowded grey and squalid huts\nl
Neighbouring proud palaces of perverted Power,\nl
Inhuman quarters and demoniac wards.\nl
A pride in evil hugged its wretchedness;\nl
A misery haunting splendour pressed those fell\nl
Dun suburbs of the cities of dream-life.\nl
Page 211

There Life displayed to the spectator soul\nl
The shadow depths of her strange miracle.\nl
A strong and fallen goddess without hope,\nl
Obscured, deformed by some dire Gorgon spell,\nl
As might a harlot empress in a bouge,\nl
Nude, unashamed, exulting she upraised\nl
Her evil face of perilous beauty and charm\nl
And, drawing panic to a shuddering kiss\nl
Twixt the magnificence of her fatal breasts,\nl
Allured to their abyss the spirit's fall.\nl
Across his field of sight she multiplied\nl
As on a scenic film or moving plate\nl
The implacable splendour of her nightmare pomps.\nl
On the dark background of a soulless world\nl
She staged between a lurid light and shade\nl
Her dramas of the sorrow of the depths\nl
Written on the agonised nerves of living things:\nl
Epics of horror and grim majesty,\nl
Wry statues spat and stiffened in life's mud,\nl
A glut of hideous forms and hideous deeds\nl
Paralysed pity in the hardened breast.\nl
In booths of sin and night-repairs of vice\nl
Styled infamies of the body's concupiscence\nl
And sordid imaginations etched in flesh,\nl
Turned lust into a decorative art:\nl
Abusing Nature's gift her pervert skill\nl
Immortalised the sown grain of living death,\nl
In a mud goblet poured the bacchic wine,\nl
To a satyr gave the thyrsus of a god.\nl
Impure, sadistic, with grimacing mouths,\nl
Grey foul inventions gruesome and macabre\nl
Came televisioned from the gulfs of Night.\nl
Her craft ingenious in monstrosity,\nl
Impatient of all natural shape and poise,\nl
A gape of nude exaggerated lines,\nl
Gave caricature a stark reality,\nl
Page 212

And art-parades of weird distorted forms,\nl
And gargoyle masques obscene and terrible\nl
Trampled to tormented postures the torn sense.\nl
An inexorable evil's worshipper,\nl
She made vileness great and sublimated filth;\nl
A dragon power of reptile energies\nl
And strange epiphanies of grovelling Force\nl
And serpent grandeurs couching in the mire\nl
Drew adoration to a gleam of slime.\nl
All Nature pulled out of her frame and base\nl
Was twisted into an unnatural pose:\nl
Repulsion stimulated inert desire;\nl
Agony was made a red-spiced food for bliss,\nl
Hatred was trusted with the work of lust\nl
And torture took the form of an embrace;\nl
A ritual anguish consecrated death;\nl
Worship was offered to the Undivine.\nl
A new aesthesis of Inferno's art\nl
That trained the mind to love what the soul hates,\nl
Imposed allegiance on the quivering nerves\nl
And forced the unwilling body to vibrate.\nl
Too sweet and too harmonious to excite\nl
In this regime that soiled the being's core,\nl
Beauty was banned, the heart's feeling dulled to sleep\nl
And cherished in their place sensation's thrills;\nl
The world was probed for jets of sense-appeal.\nl
Here cold material intellect was the judge\nl
And needed sensual prick and jog and lash\nl
That its hard dryness and dead nerves might feel\nl
Some passion and power and acrid point of life.\nl
A new philosophy theorised evil's rights,\nl
Gloried in the shimmering rot of decadence,\nl
Or gave to a python Force persuasive speech\nl
And armed with knowledge the primaeval brute.\nl
Over life and Matter only brooding bowed,\nl
Mind changed to the image of a rampant beast;\nl
Page 213

It scrambled into the pit to dig for truth\nl
And lighted its search with the subconscient's flares.\nl
Thence bubbling rose sullying the upper air,\nl
The filth and festering secrets of the Abyss:\nl
This it called positive fact and real life.\nl
This now composed the fetid atmosphere.\nl
A wild-beast passion crept from secret Night\nl
To watch its prey with fascinating eyes:\nl
Around him like a fire with sputtering tongues\nl
There lolled and laughed a bestial ecstasy;\nl
The air was packed with longings brute and fierce;\nl
Crowding and stinging in a monstrous swarm\nl
Pressed with a noxious hum into his mind\nl
Thoughts that could poison Nature's heavenliest breath,\nl
Forcing reluctant lids assailed the sight\nl
Acts that revealed the mystery of Hell.\nl
All that was there was on this pattern made.\nl

\spar A race possessed inhabited those parts.\nl
A force demoniac lurking in man's depths\nl
That heaves suppressed by the heart's human law,\nl
Awed by the calm and sovereign eyes of Thought,\nl
Can in a fire and earthquake of the soul\nl
Arise and, calling to its native night,\nl
Overthrow the reason, occupy the life\nl
And stamp its hoof on Nature's shaking ground:\nl
This was for them their being's flaming core.\nl
A mighty energy, a monster god,\nl
Hard to the strong, implacable to the weak,\nl
It stared at the harsh unpitying world it made\nl
With the stony eyelids of its fixed idea.\nl
Its heart was drunk with a dire hunger's wine,\nl
In others' suffering felt a thrilled delight\nl
And of death and ruin the grandiose music heard.\nl
To have power, to be master, was sole virtue and good:\nl
It claimed the whole world for Evil's living room,\nl
Page 214

Its party's grim totalitarian reign\nl
The cruel destiny of breathing things.\nl
All on one plan was shaped and standardised\nl
Under a dark dictatorship's breathless weight.\nl
In street and house, in councils and in courts\nl
Beings he met who looked like living men\nl
And climbed in speech upon high wings of thought\nl
But harboured all that is subhuman, vile\nl
And lower than the lowest reptile's crawl.\nl
The reason meant for nearness to the gods\nl
And uplift to heavenly scale by the touch of mind\nl
Only enhanced by its enlightening ray\nl
Their inborn nature's wry monstrosity.\nl
Often, a familiar visage studying\nl
Joyfully encountered at some dangerous turn,\nl
Hoping to recognise a look of light,\nl
His vision warned by the spirit's inward eye\nl
Discovered suddenly Hell's trademark there,\nl
Or saw with the inner sense that cannot err,\nl
In the semblance of a fair or virile form\nl
The demon and the goblin and the ghoul.\nl
An insolence reigned of cold stone-hearted strength\nl
Mighty, obeyed, approved by the Titan's law,\nl
The huge laughter of a giant cruelty\nl
And fierce glad deeds of ogre violence.\nl
In that wide cynic den of thinking beasts\nl
One looked in vain for a trace of pity or love;\nl
There was no touch of sweetness anywhere,\nl
But only Force and its acolytes, greed and hate:\nl
There was no help for suffering, none to save,\nl
None dared resist or speak a noble word.\nl
Armed with the aegis of tyrannic Power,\nl
Signing the edicts of her dreadful rule\nl
And using blood and torture as a seal,\nl
Darkness proclaimed her slogans to the world.\nl
A servile blinkered silence hushed the mind\nl
Page 215

Or only it repeated lessons taught,\nl
While mitred, holding the good shepherd's staff,\nl
Falsehood enthroned on awed and prostrate hearts\nl
The cults and creeds that organise living death\nl
And slay the soul on the altar of a lie.\nl
All were deceived or served their own deceit;\nl
Truth in that stifling atmosphere could not live.\nl
There wretchedness believed in its own joy\nl
And fear and weakness hugged their abject depths;\nl
All that is low and sordid-thoughted, base,\nl
All that is drab and poor and miserable,\nl
Breathed in a lax content its natural air\nl
And felt no yearning of divine release:\nl
Arrogant, gibing at more luminous states\nl
The people of the gulfs despised the sun.\nl
A barriered autarchy excluded light;\nl
Fixed in its will to be its own grey self,\nl
It vaunted its norm unique and splendid type:\nl
It soothed its hunger with a plunderer's dream;\nl
Flaunting its cross of servitude like a crown,\nl
It clung to its dismal harsh autonomy.\nl
A bull-throat bellowed with its brazen tongue;\nl
Its hard and shameless clamour filling Space\nl
And threatening all who dared to listen to truth\nl
Claimed the monopoly of the battered ear;\nl
A deafened acquiescence gave its vote,\nl
And braggart dogmas shouted in the night\nl
Kept for the fallen soul once deemed a god\nl
The pride of its abysmal absolute.\nl

\spar A lone discoverer in these menacing realms\nl
Guarded like termite cities from the sun,\nl
Oppressed mid crowd and tramp and noise and flare,\nl
Passing from dusk to deeper dangerous dusk,\nl
He wrestled with powers that snatched from mind its light\nl
And smote from him their clinging influences.\nl
Page 216

Soon he emerged in a dim wall-less space.\nl
For now the peopled tracts were left behind;\nl
He walked between wide banks of failing eve.\nl
Around him grew a gaunt spiritual blank,\nl
A threatening waste, a sinister loneliness\nl
That left mind bare to an unseen assault,\nl
An empty page on which all that willed could write\nl
Stark monstrous messages without control.\nl
A travelling dot on downward roads of Dusk\nl
Mid barren fields and barns and straggling huts\nl
And a few crooked and phantasmal trees,\nl
He faced a sense of death and conscious void.\nl
But still a hostile Life unseen was there\nl
Whose deathlike poise resisting light and truth\nl
Made living a bleak gap in nullity.\nl
He heard the grisly voices that deny;\nl
Assailed by thoughts that swarmed like spectral hordes,\nl
A prey to the staring phantoms of the gloom\nl
And terror approaching with its lethal mouth,\nl
Driven by a strange will down ever down,\nl
The sky above a communiqu\'e of Doom,\nl
He strove to shield his spirit from despair,\nl
But felt the horror of the growing Night\nl
And the Abyss rising to claim his soul.\nl
Then ceased the abodes of creatures and their forms\nl
And solitude wrapped him in its voiceless folds.\nl
All vanished suddenly like a thought expunged;\nl
His spirit became an empty listening gulf\nl
Void of the dead illusion of a world:\nl
Nothing was left, not even an evil face.\nl
He was alone with the grey python Night.\nl
A dense and nameless Nothing conscious, mute,\nl
Which seemed alive but without body or mind,\nl
Lusted all beings to annihilate\nl
That it might be for ever nude and sole.\nl
As in a shapeless beast's intangible jaws,\nl
Page 217

Gripped, strangled by that lusting viscous blot,\nl
Attracted to some black and giant mouth\nl
And swallowing throat and a huge belly of doom,\nl
His being from its own vision disappeared\nl
Drawn towards depths that hungered for its fall.\nl
A formless void oppressed his struggling brain,\nl
A darkness grim and cold benumbed his flesh,\nl
A whispered grey suggestion chilled his heart;\nl
Haled by a serpent-force from its warm home\nl
And dragged to extinction in bleak vacancy\nl
Life clung to its seat with cords of gasping breath;\nl
Lapped was his body by a tenebrous tongue.\nl
Existence smothered travailed to survive;\nl
Hope strangled perished in his empty soul,\nl
Belief and memory abolished died\nl
And all that helps the spirit in its course.\nl
There crawled through every tense and aching nerve\nl
Leaving behind its poignant quaking trail\nl
A nameless and unutterable fear.\nl
As a sea nears a victim bound and still,\nl
The approach alarmed his mind for ever dumb\nl
Of an implacable eternity\nl
Of pain inhuman and intolerable.\nl
This he must bear, his hope of heaven estranged;\nl
He must ever exist without extinction's peace\nl
In a slow suffering Time and tortured Space,\nl
An anguished nothingness his endless state.\nl
A lifeless vacancy was now his breast,\nl
And in the place where once was luminous thought,\nl
Only remained like a pale motionless ghost\nl
An incapacity for faith and hope\nl
And the dread conviction of a vanquished soul\nl
Immortal still but with its godhead lost,\nl
Self lost and God and touch of happier worlds.\nl
But he endured, stilled the vain terror, bore\nl
The smothering coils of agony and affright;\nl
Page 218

Then peace returned and the soul's sovereign gaze.\nl
To the blank horror a calm Light replied:\nl
Immutable, undying and unborn,\nl
Mighty and mute the Godhead in him woke\nl
And faced the pain and danger of the world.\nl
He mastered the tides of Nature with a look:\nl
He met with his bare spirit naked Hell.\nl

\sbigcap Then could he see the hidden heart of Night:\nl
The labour of its stark unconsciousness\nl
Revealed the endless terrible Inane.\nl
A spiritless blank Infinity was there;\nl
A Nature that denied the eternal Truth\nl
In the vain braggart freedom of its thought\nl
Hoped to abolish God and reign alone.\nl
There was no sovereign Guest, no witness Light;\nl
Unhelped it would create its own bleak world.\nl
Its large blind eyes looked out on demon acts,\nl
Its deaf ears heard the untruth its dumb lips spoke;\nl
Its huge misguided fancy took vast shapes,\nl
Its mindless sentience quivered with fierce conceits;\nl
Engendering a brute principle of life\nl
Evil and pain begot a monstrous soul.\nl
The Anarchs of the formless depths arose,\nl
Great Titan beings and demoniac powers,\nl
World-egos racked with lust and thought and will,\nl
Vast minds and lives without a spirit within:\nl
Impatient architects of error's house,\nl
Leaders of the cosmic ignorance and unrest\nl
And sponsors of sorrow and mortality\nl
Embodied the dark Ideas of the Abyss.\nl
A shadow substance into emptiness came,\nl
Dim forms were born in the unthinking Void\nl
And eddies met and made an adverse Space\nl
In whose black folds Being imagined Hell.\nl
His eyes piercing the triple-plated gloom\nl
Identified their sight with its blind stare:\nl
Accustomed to the unnatural dark, they saw\nl
Page 220

Unreality made real and conscious Night.\nl
A violent, fierce and formidable world,\nl
An ancient womb of huge calamitous dreams,\nl
Coiled like a larva in the obscurity\nl
That keeps it from the spear-points of Heaven's stars.\nl
It was the gate of a false Infinite,\nl
An eternity of disastrous absolutes,\nl
An immense negation of spiritual things.\nl
All once self-luminous in the spirit's sphere\nl
Turned now into their own dark contraries:\nl
Being collapsed into a pointless void\nl
That yet was a zero parent of the worlds;\nl
Inconscience swallowing up the cosmic Mind\nl
Produced a universe from its lethal sleep;\nl
Bliss into black coma fallen, insensible,\nl
Coiled back to itself and God's eternal joy\nl
Through a false poignant figure of grief and pain\nl
Still dolorously nailed upon a cross\nl
Fixed in the soil of a dumb insentient world\nl
Where birth was a pang and death an agony,\nl
Lest all too soon should change again to bliss.\nl
Thought sat, a priestess of Perversity,\nl
On her black tripod of the triune Snake\nl
Reading by opposite signs the eternal script,\nl
A sorceress reversing life's God-frame.\nl
In darkling aisles with evil eyes for lamps\nl
And fatal voices chanting from the apse,\nl
In strange infernal dim basilicas\nl
Intoning the magic of the unholy Word,\nl
The ominous profound Initiate\nl
Performed the ritual of her Mysteries.\nl
There suffering was Nature's daily food\nl
Alluring to the anguished heart and flesh,\nl
And torture was the formula of delight,\nl
Pain mimicked the celestial ecstasy.\nl
There Good, a faithless gardener of God,\nl
Page 221

Watered with virtue the world's upas-tree\nl
And, careful of the outward word and act,\nl
Engrafted his hypocrite blooms on native ill.\nl
All high things served their nether opposite:\nl
The forms of Gods sustained a demon cult;\nl
Heaven's face became a mask and snare of Hell.\nl
There in the heart of vain phenomenon,\nl
In an enormous action's writhen core\nl
He saw a Shape illimitable and vague\nl
Sitting on Death who swallows all things born.\nl
A chill fixed face with dire and motionless eyes,\nl
Her dreadful trident in her shadowy hand\nl
Outstretched, she pierced all creatures with one fate.\nl

\spar When nothing was save Matter without soul\nl
And a spiritless hollow was the heart of Time,\nl
Then Life first touched the insensible Abyss;\nl
Awaking the stark Void to hope and grief\nl
Her pallid beam smote the unfathomed Night\nl
In which God hid himself from his own view.\nl
In all things she sought their slumbering mystic truth,\nl
The unspoken Word that inspires unconscious forms;\nl
She groped in his deeps for an invisible Law,\nl
Fumbled in the dim subconscient for his mind\nl
And strove to find a way for spirit to be.\nl
But from the Night another answer came.\nl
A seed was in that nether matrix cast,\nl
A dumb unprobed husk of perverted truth,\nl
A cell of an insentient infinite.\nl
A monstrous birth prepared its cosmic form\nl
In Nature's titan embryo, Ignorance.\nl
Then in a fatal and stupendous hour\nl
Something that sprang from the stark Inconscient's sleep\nl
Unwillingly begotten by the mute Void,\nl
Lifted its ominous head against the stars;\nl
Overshadowing earth with its huge body of Doom\nl
Page 222

It chilled the heavens with the menace of a face.\nl
A nameless Power, a shadowy Will arose\nl
Immense and alien to our universe.\nl
In the inconceivable Purpose none can gauge\nl
A vast Non-Being robed itself with shape,\nl
The boundless Nescience of the unconscious depths\nl
Covered eternity with nothingness.\nl
A seeking Mind replaced the seeing Soul:\nl
Life grew into a huge and hungry death,\nl
The Spirit's bliss was changed to cosmic pain.\nl
Assuring God's self-cowled neutrality\nl
A mighty opposition conquered Space.\nl
A sovereign ruling falsehood, death and grief,\nl
It pressed its fierce hegemony on the earth;\nl
Disharmonising the original style\nl
Of the architecture of her fate's design,\nl
It falsified the primal cosmic Will\nl
And bound to struggle and dread vicissitudes\nl
The long slow process of the patient Power.\nl
Implanting error in the stuff of things\nl
It made an Ignorance of the all-wise Law;\nl
It baffled the sure touch of life's hid sense,\nl
Kept dumb the intuitive guide in Matter's sleep,\nl
Deformed the insect's instinct and the brute's,\nl
Disfigured man's thought-born humanity.\nl
A shadow fell across the simple Ray:\nl
Obscured was the Truth-light in the cavern heart\nl
That burns unwitnessed in the altar crypt\nl
Behind the still velamen's secrecy\nl
Companioning the Godhead of the shrine.\nl
Thus was the dire antagonist Energy born\nl
Who mimes the eternal Mother's mighty shape\nl
And mocks her luminous infinity\nl
With a grey distorted silhouette in the Night.\nl
Arresting the passion of the climbing soul,\nl
She forced on life a slow and faltering pace;\nl
Page 223

Her hand's deflecting and retarding weight\nl
Is laid on the mystic evolution's curve:\nl
The tortuous line of her deceiving mind\nl
The Gods see not and man is impotent;\nl
Oppressing the God-spark within the soul\nl
She forces back to the beast the human fall.\nl
Yet in her formidable instinctive mind\nl
She feels the One grow in the heart of Time\nl
And sees the Immortal shine through the human mould.\nl
Alarmed for her rule and full of fear and rage\nl
She prowls around each light that gleams through the dark\nl
Casting its ray from the spirit's lonely tent,\nl
Hoping to enter with fierce stealthy tread\nl
And in the cradle slay the divine Child.\nl
Incalculable are her strength and ruse;\nl
Her touch is a fascination and a death;\nl
She kills her victim with his own delight;\nl
Even Good she makes a hook to drag to Hell.\nl
For her the world runs to its agony.\nl
Often the pilgrim on the Eternal's road\nl
Ill-lit from clouds by the pale moon of Mind,\nl
Or in devious byways wandering alone,\nl
Or lost in deserts where no path is seen,\nl
Falls overpowered by her lion leap,\nl
A conquered captive under her dreadful paws.\nl
Intoxicated by a burning breath\nl
And amorous grown of a destroying mouth,\nl
Once a companion of the sacred Fire,\nl
The mortal perishes to God and Light,\nl
An Adversary governs heart and brain,\nl
A Nature hostile to the Mother-Force.\nl
The self of life yields up its instruments\nl
To Titan and demoniac agencies\nl
That aggrandise earth-nature and disframe:\nl
A cowled fifth-columnist is now thought's guide;\nl
His subtle defeatist murmur slays the faith\nl
Page 224

And, lodged in the breast or whispering from outside,\nl
A lying inspiration fell and dark\nl
A new order substitutes for the divine.\nl
A silence falls upon the spirit's heights,\nl
From the veiled sanctuary the God retires,\nl
Empty and cold is the chamber of the Bride;\nl
The golden Nimbus now is seen no more,\nl
No longer burns the white spiritual ray\nl
And hushed for ever is the secret Voice.\nl
Then by the Angel of the Vigil Tower\nl
A name is struck from the recording book;\nl
A flame that sang in Heaven sinks quenched and mute;\nl
In ruin ends the epic of a soul.\nl
This is the tragedy of the inner death\nl
When forfeited is the divine element\nl
And only a mind and body live to die.\nl

\spar For terrible agencies the Spirit allows\nl
And there are subtle and enormous Powers\nl
That shield themselves with the covering Ignorance.\nl
Offspring of the gulfs, agents of the shadowy Force,\nl
Haters of light, intolerant of peace,\nl
Aping to the thought the shining Friend and Guide,\nl
Opposing in the heart the eternal Will,\nl
They veil the occult uplifting Harmonist.\nl
His wisdom's oracles are made our bonds;\nl
The doors of God they have locked with keys of creed\nl
And shut out by the Law his tireless Grace.\nl
Along all Nature's lines they have set their posts\nl
And intercept the caravans of Light;\nl
Wherever the Gods act, they intervene.\nl
A yoke is laid upon the world's dim heart;\nl
Masked are its beats from the supernal Bliss,\nl
And the closed peripheries of brilliant Mind\nl
Block the fine entries of celestial Fire.\nl
Always the dark Adventurers seem to win;\nl
Page 225

Nature they fill with evil's institutes,\nl
Turn into defeats the victories of Truth,\nl
Proclaim as falsehoods the eternal laws,\nl
And load the dice of Doom with wizard lies;\nl
The world's shrines they have occupied, usurped its thrones.\nl
In scorn of the dwindling chances of the Gods\nl
They claim creation as their conquered fief\nl
And crown themselves the iron Lords of Time.\nl
Adepts of the illusion and the mask,\nl
The artificers of Nature's fall and pain\nl
Have built their altars of triumphant Night\nl
In the clay temple of terrestrial life.\nl
In the vacant precincts of the sacred Fire,\nl
In front of the reredos in the mystic rite\nl
Facing the dim velamen none can pierce,\nl
Intones his solemn hymn the mitred priest\nl
Invoking their dreadful presence in his breast:\nl
Attributing to them the awful Name\nl
He chants the syllables of the magic text\nl
And summons the unseen communion's act,\nl
While twixt the incense and the muttered prayer\nl
All the fierce bale with which the world is racked\nl
Is mixed in the foaming chalice of man's heart\nl
And poured to them like sacramental wine.\nl
Assuming names divine they guide and rule.\nl
Opponents of the Highest they have come\nl
Out of their world of soulless thought and power\nl
To serve by enmity the cosmic scheme.\nl
Night is their refuge and strategic base.\nl
Against the sword of Flame, the luminous Eye,\nl
Bastioned they live in massive forts of gloom,\nl
Calm and secure in sunless privacy:\nl
No wandering ray of Heaven can enter there.\nl
Armoured, protected by their lethal masks,\nl
As in a studio of creative Death\nl
The giant sons of Darkness sit and plan\nl
Page 226

The drama of the earth, their tragic stage.\nl
All who would raise the fallen world must come\nl
Under the dangerous arches of their power;\nl
For even the radiant children of the gods\nl
To darken their privilege is and dreadful right.\nl
None can reach heaven who has not passed through hell.\nl

\spar This too the traveller of the worlds must dare.\nl
A warrior in the dateless duel's strife,\nl
He entered into dumb despairing Night\nl
Challenging the darkness with his luminous soul.\nl
Alarming with his steps the threshold gloom\nl
He came into a fierce and dolorous realm\nl
Peopled by souls who never had tasted bliss;\nl
Ignorant like men born blind who know not light,\nl
They could equate worst ill with highest good,\nl
Virtue was to their eyes a face of sin\nl
And evil and misery were their natural state.\nl
A dire administration's penal code\nl
Making of grief and pain the common law,\nl
Decreeing universal joylessness\nl
Had changed life into a stoic sacrament\nl
And torture into a daily festival.\nl
An act was passed to chastise happiness;\nl
Laughter and pleasure were banned as deadly sins:\nl
A questionless mind was ranked as wise content,\nl
A dull heart's silent apathy as peace:\nl
Sleep was not there, torpor was the sole rest,\nl
Death came but neither respite gave nor end;\nl
Always the soul lived on and suffered more.\nl
Ever he deeper probed that kingdom of pain;\nl
Around him grew the terror of a world\nl
Of agony followed by worse agony,\nl
And in the terror a great wicked joy\nl
Glad of one's own and others' calamity.\nl
There thought and life were a long punishment,\nl
Page 227

The breath a burden and all hope a scourge,\nl
The body a field of torment, a massed unease;\nl
Repose was a waiting between pang and pang.\nl
This was the law of things none dreamed to change:\nl
A hard sombre heart, a harsh unsmiling mind\nl
Rejected happiness like a cloying sweet;\nl
Tranquillity was a tedium and ennui:\nl
Only by suffering life grew colourful;\nl
It needed the spice of pain, the salt of tears.\nl
If one could cease to be, all would be well;\nl
Else only fierce sensations gave some zest:\nl
A fury of jealousy burning the gnawed heart,\nl
The sting of murderous spite and hate and lust,\nl
The whisper that lures to the pit and treachery's stroke\nl
Threw vivid spots on the dull aching hours.\nl
To watch the drama of infelicity,\nl
The writhing of creatures under the harrow of doom\nl
And sorrow's tragic gaze into the night\nl
And horror and the hammering heart of fear\nl
Were the ingredients in Time's heavy cup\nl
That pleased and helped to enjoy its bitter taste.\nl
Of such fierce stuff was made up life's long hell:\nl
These were the threads of the dark spider's-web\nl
In which the soul was caught, quivering and rapt;\nl
This was religion, this was Nature's rule.\nl
In a fell chapel of iniquity\nl
To worship a black pitiless image of Power\nl
Kneeling one must cross hard-hearted stony courts,\nl
A pavement like a floor of evil fate.\nl
Each stone was a keen edge of ruthless force\nl
And glued with the chilled blood from tortured breasts;\nl
The dry gnarled trees stood up like dying men\nl
Stiffened into a pose of agony,\nl
And from each window peered an ominous priest\nl
Chanting Te Deums for slaughter's crowning grace,\nl
Uprooted cities, blasted human homes,\nl
Burned writhen bodies, the bombshell's massacre.\nl
Page 228

“Our enemies are fallen, are fallen,” they sang,\nl
“All who once stayed our will are smitten and dead;\nl
How great we are, how merciful art Thou.”\nl
Thus thought they to reach God's impassive throne\nl
And Him command whom all their acts opposed,\nl
Magnifying their deeds to touch his skies,\nl
And make him an accomplice of their crimes.\nl
There no relenting pity could have place,\nl
But ruthless strength and iron moods had sway,\nl
A dateless sovereignty of terror and gloom:\nl
This took the figure of a darkened God\nl
Revered by the racked wretchedness he had made,\nl
Who held in thrall a miserable world,\nl
And helpless hearts nailed to unceasing woe\nl
Adored the feet that trampled them into mire.\nl
It was a world of sorrow and of hate,\nl
Sorrow with hatred for its lonely joy,\nl
Hatred with others' sorrow as its feast;\nl
A bitter rictus curled the suffering mouth;\nl
A tragic cruelty saw its ominous chance.\nl
Hate was the black archangel of that realm;\nl
It glowed, a sombre jewel in the heart\nl
Burning the soul with its malignant rays,\nl
And wallowed in its fell abysm of might.\nl
These passions even objects seemed to exude,—\nl
For mind overflowed into the inanimate\nl
That answered with the wickedness it received,—\nl
Against their users used malignant powers,\nl
Hurt without hands and strangely, suddenly slew,\nl
Appointed as instruments of an unseen doom.\nl
Or they made themselves a fateful prison wall\nl
Where men condemned wake through the creeping hours\nl
Counted by the tollings of an ominous bell.\nl
An evil environment worsened evil souls:\nl
All things were conscious there and all perverse.\nl
In this infernal realm he dared to press\nl
Even into its deepest pit and darkest core,\nl
Page 229

Perturbed its tenebrous base, dared to contest\nl
Its ancient privileged right and absolute force:\nl
In Night he plunged to know her dreadful heart,\nl
In Hell he sought the root and cause of Hell.\nl
Its anguished gulfs opened in his own breast;\nl
He listened to clamours of its crowded pain,\nl
The heart-beats of its fatal loneliness.\nl
Above was a chill deaf eternity.\nl
In vague tremendous passages of Doom\nl
He heard the goblin Voice that guides to slay,\nl
And faced the enchantments of the demon Sign,\nl
And traversed the ambush of the opponent Snake.\nl
In menacing tracts, in tortured solitudes\nl
Companionless he roamed through desolate ways\nl
Where the red Wolf waits by the fordless stream\nl
And Death's black eagles scream to the precipice,\nl
And met the hounds of bale who hunt men's hearts\nl
Baying across the veldts of Destiny,\nl
In footless battlefields of the Abyss\nl
Fought shadowy combats in mute eyeless depths,\nl
Assaults of Hell endured and Titan strokes\nl
And bore the fierce inner wounds that are slow to heal.\nl
A prisoner of a hooded magic Force,\nl
Captured and trailed in Falsehood's lethal net\nl
And often strangled in the noose of grief,\nl
Or cast in the grim morass of swallowing doubt,\nl
Or shut into pits of error and despair,\nl
He drank her poison draughts till none was left.\nl
In a world where neither hope nor joy could come\nl
The ordeal he suffered of evil's absolute reign,\nl
Yet kept intact his spirit's radiant truth.\nl
Incapable of motion or of force,\nl
In Matter's blank denial gaoled and blind,\nl
Pinned to the black inertia of our base\nl
He treasured between his hands his flickering soul.\nl
His being ventured into mindless Void,\nl
Intolerant gulfs that knew not thought nor sense;\nl
Page 230

Thought ceased, sense failed, his soul still saw and knew.\nl
In atomic parcellings of the Infinite\nl
Near to the dumb beginnings of lost Self,\nl
He felt the curious small futility\nl
Of the creation of material things.\nl
Or, stifled in the Inconscient's hollow dusk,\nl
He sounded the mystery dark and bottomless\nl
Of the enormous and unmeaning deeps\nl
Whence struggling life in a dead universe rose.\nl
There in the stark identity lost by mind\nl
He felt the sealed sense of the insensible world\nl
And a mute wisdom in the unknowing Night.\nl
Into the abysmal secrecy he came\nl
Where darkness peers from her mattress, grey and nude,\nl
And stood on the last locked subconscient's floor\nl
Where Being slept unconscious of its thoughts\nl
And built the world not knowing what it built.\nl
There waiting its hour the future lay unknown,\nl
There is the record of the vanished stars.\nl
There in the slumber of the cosmic Will\nl
He saw the secret key of Nature's change.\nl
A light was with him, an invisible hand\nl
Was laid upon the error and the pain\nl
Till it became a quivering ecstasy,\nl
The shock of sweetness of an arm's embrace.\nl
He saw in Night the Eternal's shadowy veil,\nl
Knew death for a cellar of the house of life,\nl
In destruction felt creation's hasty pace,\nl
Knew loss as the price of a celestial gain\nl
And hell as a short cut to heaven's gates.\nl
Then in Illusion's occult factory\nl
And in the Inconscient's magic printing-house\nl
Torn were the formats of the primal Night\nl
And shattered the stereotypes of Ignorance.\nl
Alive, breathing a deep spiritual breath,\nl
Nature expunged her stiff mechanical code\nl
And the articles of the bound soul's contract,\nl
Page 231

Falsehood gave back to Truth her tortured shape.\nl
Annulled were the tables of the law of Pain,\nl
And in their place grew luminous characters.\nl
The skilful Penman's unseen finger wrote\nl
His swift intuitive calligraphy;\nl
Earth's forms were made his divine documents,\nl
The wisdom embodied mind could not reveal,\nl
Inconscience chased from the world's voiceless breast;\nl
Transfigured were the fixed schemes of reasoning Thought.\nl
Arousing consciousness in things inert,\nl
He imposed upon dark atom and dumb mass\nl
The diamond script of the Imperishable,\nl
Inscribed on the dim heart of fallen things\nl
A paean-song of the free Infinite\nl
And the Name, foundation of eternity,\nl
And traced on the awake exultant cells\nl
In the ideographs of the Ineffable\nl
The lyric of the love that waits through Time\nl
And the mystic volume of the Book of Bliss\nl
And the message of the superconscient Fire.\nl
Then life beat pure in the corporeal frame;\nl
The infernal Gleam died and could slay no more.\nl
Hell split across its huge abrupt fa\c{c}ade\nl
As if a magic building were undone,\nl
Night opened and vanished like a gulf of dream.\nl
Into being's gap scooped out as empty Space\nl
In which she had filled the place of absent God,\nl
There poured a wide intimate and blissful Dawn;\nl
Healed were all things that Time's torn heart had made\nl
And sorrow could live no more in Nature's breast:\nl
Division ceased to be, for God was there.\nl
The soul lit the conscious body with its ray,\nl
Matter and spirit mingled and were one.\nl

\sbigcap Around him shone a great felicitous Day.\nl
A lustre of some rapturous Infinite,\nl
It held in the splendour of its golden laugh\nl
Regions of the heart's happiness set free,\nl
Intoxicated with the wine of God,\nl
Immersed in light, perpetually divine.\nl
A favourite and intimate of the Gods\nl
Obeying the divine command to joy,\nl
It was the sovereign of its own delight\nl
And master of the kingdoms of its force.\nl
Assured of the bliss for which all forms were made,\nl
Unmoved by fear and grief and the shocks of Fate\nl
And unalarmed by the breath of fleeting Time\nl
And unbesieged by adverse circumstance,\nl
It breathed in a sweet secure unguarded ease\nl
Free from our body's frailty inviting death,\nl
Far from our danger-zone of stumbling Will.\nl
It needed not to curb its passionate beats;\nl
Thrilled by the clasp of the warm satisfied sense\nl
And the swift wonder-rush and flame and cry\nl
Of the life-impulses' red magnificent race,\nl
It lived in a jewel-rhythm of the laughter of God\nl
And lay on the breast of universal love.\nl
Immune the unfettered Spirit of Delight\nl
Pastured his gleaming sun-herds and moon-flocks\nl
Along the lyric speed of griefless streams\nl
In fragrance of the unearthly asphodel.\nl
A silence of felicity wrapped the heavens,\nl
A careless radiance smiled upon the heights;\nl
A murmur of inarticulate ravishment\nl
Trembled in the winds and touched the enchanted soil;\nl
Page 233

Incessant in the arms of ecstasy\nl
Repeating its sweet involuntary note\nl
A sob of rapture flowed along the hours.\nl
Advancing under an arch of glory and peace,\nl
Traveller on plateau and on musing ridge,\nl
As one who sees in the World-Magician's glass\nl
A miracled imagery of soul-scapes flee\nl
He traversed scenes of an immortal joy\nl
And gazed into abysms of beauty and bliss.\nl
Around him was a light of conscious suns\nl
And a brooding gladness of great symbol things;\nl
To meet him crowded plains of brilliant calm,\nl
Mountains and violet valleys of the Blest,\nl
Deep glens of joy and crooning waterfalls\nl
And woods of quivering purple solitude;\nl
Below him lay like gleaming jewelled thoughts\nl
Rapt dreaming cities of Gandharva kings.\nl
Across the vibrant secrecies of Space\nl
A dim and happy music sweetly stole,\nl
Smitten by unseen hands he heard heart-close\nl
The harps' cry of the heavenly minstrels pass,\nl
And voices of unearthly melody\nl
Chanted the glory of eternal love\nl
In the white-blue-moonbeam air of Paradise.\nl
A summit and core of all that marvellous world,\nl
Apart stood high Elysian nameless hills,\nl
Burning like sunsets in a trance of eve.\nl
As if to some new unsearched profundity,\nl
Into a joyful stillness plunged their base;\nl
Their slopes through a hurry of laughter and voices sank,\nl
Crossed by a throng of singing rivulets,\nl
Adoring blue heaven with their happy hymn,\nl
Down into woods of shadowy secrecy:\nl
Lifted into wide voiceless mystery\nl
Their peaks climbed towards a greatness beyond life.\nl
The shining Edens of the vital gods\nl
Page 234

Received him in their deathless harmonies.\nl
All things were perfect there that flower in Time;\nl
Beauty was there creation's native mould,\nl
Peace was a thrilled voluptuous purity.\nl
There Love fulfilled her gold and roseate dreams\nl
And Strength her crowned and mighty reveries;\nl
Desire climbed up, a swift omnipotent flame,\nl
And Pleasure had the stature of the gods;\nl
Dream walked along the highways of the stars;\nl
Sweet common things turned into miracles:\nl
Overtaken by the spirit's sudden spell,\nl
Smitten by a divine passion's alchemy,\nl
Pain's self compelled transformed to potent joy\nl
Curing the antithesis twixt heaven and hell.\nl
All life's high visions are embodied there,\nl
Her wandering hopes achieved, her aureate combs\nl
Caught by the honey-eater's darting tongue,\nl
Her burning guesses changed to ecstasied truths,\nl
Her mighty pantings stilled in deathless calm\nl
And liberated her immense desires.\nl
In that paradise of perfect heart and sense\nl
No lower note could break the endless charm\nl
Of her sweetness ardent and immaculate;\nl
Her steps are sure of their intuitive fall.\nl
After the anguish of the soul's long strife\nl
At length were found calm and celestial rest\nl
And, lapped in a magic flood of sorrowless hours,\nl
Healed were his warrior nature's wounded limbs\nl
In the encircling arms of Energies\nl
That brooked no stain and feared not their own bliss.\nl
In scenes forbidden to our pallid sense\nl
Amid miraculous scents and wonder-hues\nl
He met the forms that divinise the sight,\nl
To music that can immortalise the mind\nl
And make the heart wide as infinity\nl
Listened, and captured the inaudible\nl
Page 235

Cadences that awake the occult ear:\nl
Out of the ineffable hush it hears them come\nl
Trembling with the beauty of a wordless speech,\nl
And thoughts too great and deep to find a voice,\nl
Thoughts whose desire new-makes the universe.\nl
A scale of sense that climbed with fiery feet\nl
To heights of unimagined happiness,\nl
Recast his being's aura in joy-glow,\nl
His body glimmered like a skiey shell;\nl
His gates to the world were swept with seas of light.\nl
His earth, dowered with celestial competence,\nl
Harboured a power that needed now no more\nl
To cross the closed customs-line of mind and flesh\nl
And smuggle godhead into humanity.\nl
It shrank no more from the supreme demand\nl
Of an untired capacity for bliss,\nl
A might that could explore its own infinite\nl
And beauty and passion and the depths' reply\nl
Nor feared the swoon of glad identity\nl
Where spirit and flesh in inner ecstasy join\nl
Annulling the quarrel between self and shape.\nl
It drew from sight and sound spiritual power,\nl
Made sense a road to reach the intangible:\nl
It thrilled with the supernal influences\nl
That build the substance of life's deeper soul.\nl
Earth-nature stood reborn, comrade of heaven.\nl
A fit companion of the timeless Kings,\nl
Equalled with the godheads of the living Suns,\nl
He mixed in the radiant pastimes of the Unborn,\nl
Heard whispers of the Player never seen\nl
And listened to his voice that steals the heart\nl
And draws it to the breast of God's desire,\nl
And felt its honey of felicity\nl
Flow through his veins like the rivers of Paradise,\nl
Made body a nectar-cup of the Absolute.\nl
In sudden moments of revealing flame,\nl
Page 236

In passionate responses half-unveiled\nl
He reached the rim of ecstasies unknown;\nl
A touch supreme surprised his hurrying heart,\nl
The clasp was remembered of the Wonderful,\nl
And hints leaped down of white beatitudes.\nl
Eternity drew close disguised as Love\nl
And laid its hand upon the body of Time.\nl
A little gift comes from the Immensitudes,\nl
But measureless to life its gain of joy;\nl
All the untold Beyond is mirrored there.\nl
A giant drop of the Bliss unknowable\nl
Overwhelmed his limbs and round his soul became\nl
A fiery ocean of felicity;\nl
He foundered drowned in sweet and burning vasts:\nl
The dire delight that could shatter mortal flesh,\nl
The rapture that the gods sustain he bore.\nl
Immortal pleasure cleansed him in its waves\nl
And turned his strength into undying power.\nl
Immortality captured Time and carried Life.\nl

\sbigcap This too must now be overpassed and left,\nl
As all must be until the Highest is gained\nl
In whom the world and self grow true and one:\nl
Till That is reached our journeying cannot cease.\nl
Always a nameless goal beckons beyond,\nl
Always ascends the zigzag of the gods\nl
And upward points the spirit's climbing Fire.\nl
This breath of hundred-hued felicity\nl
And its pure heightened figure of Time's joy,\nl
Tossed upon waves of flawless happiness,\nl
Hammered into single beats of ecstasy,\nl
This fraction of the spirit's integer\nl
Caught into a passionate greatness of extremes,\nl
This limited being lifted to zenith bliss,\nl
Happy to enjoy one touch of things supreme,\nl
Packed into its sealed small infinity,\nl
Its endless time-made world outfacing Time,\nl
A little output of God's vast delight.\nl
The moments stretched towards the eternal Now,\nl
The hours discovered immortality,\nl
But, satisfied with their sublime contents,\nl
On peaks they ceased whose tops half-way to Heaven\nl
Pointed to an apex they could never mount,\nl
To a grandeur in whose air they could not live.\nl
Inviting to their high and exquisite sphere,\nl
To their secure and fine extremities\nl
This creature who hugs his limits to feel safe,\nl
These heights declined a greater adventure's call.\nl
A glory and sweetness of satisfied desire\nl
Tied up the spirit to golden posts of bliss.\nl
It could not house the wideness of a soul\nl
Page 238

Which needed all infinity for its home.\nl
A memory soft as grass and faint as sleep,\nl
The beauty and call receding sank behind\nl
Like a sweet song heard fading far away\nl
Upon the long high road to Timelessness.\nl
Above was an ardent white tranquillity.\nl
A musing spirit looked out on the worlds\nl
And like a brilliant clambering of skies\nl
Passing through clarity to an unseen Light\nl
Large lucent realms of Mind from stillness shone.\nl
But first he met a silver-grey expanse\nl
Where Day and Night had wedded and were one:\nl
It was a tract of dim and shifting rays\nl
Parting Life's sentient flow from Thought's self-poise.\nl
A coalition of uncertainties\nl
There exercised uneasy government\nl
On a ground reserved for doubt and reasoned guess,\nl
A rendezvous of Knowledge with Ignorance.\nl
At its low extremity held difficult sway\nl
A mind that hardly saw and slowly found;\nl
Its nature to our earthly nature close\nl
And kin to our precarious mortal thought\nl
That looks from soil to sky and sky to soil\nl
But knows not the below nor the beyond,\nl
It only sensed itself and outward things.\nl
This was the first means of our slow ascent\nl
From the half-conscience of the animal soul\nl
Living in a crowded press of shape-events\nl
In a realm it cannot understand nor change;\nl
Only it sees and acts in a given scene\nl
And feels and joys and sorrows for a while.\nl
The ideas that drive the obscure embodied spirit\nl
Along the roads of suffering and desire\nl
In a world that struggles to discover Truth,\nl
Found here their power to be and Nature-force.\nl
Here are devised the forms of an ignorant life\nl
Page 239

That sees the empiric fact as settled law,\nl
Labours for the hour and not for eternity\nl
And trades its gains to meet the moment's call:\nl
The slow process of a material mind\nl
Which serves the body it should rule and use\nl
And needs to lean upon an erring sense,\nl
Was born in that luminous obscurity.\nl
Advancing tardily from a limping start,\nl
Crutching hypothesis on argument,\nl
Throning its theories as certitudes,\nl
It reasons from the half-known to the unknown,\nl
Ever constructing its frail house of thought,\nl
Ever undoing the web that it has spun.\nl
A twilight sage whose shadow seems to him self,\nl
Moving from minute to brief minute lives;\nl
A king dependent on his satellites\nl
Signs the decrees of ignorant ministers,\nl
A judge in half-possession of his proofs,\nl
A voice clamant of uncertainty's postulates,\nl
An architect of knowledge, not its source.\nl
This powerful bondslave of his instruments\nl
Thinks his low station Nature's highest top,\nl
Oblivious of his share in all things made\nl
And haughtily humble in his own conceit\nl
Believes himself a spawn of Matter's mud\nl
And takes his own creations for his cause.\nl
To eternal light and knowledge meant to rise,\nl
Up from man's bare beginning is our climb;\nl
Out of earth's heavy smallness we must break,\nl
We must search our nature with spiritual fire:\nl
An insect crawl preludes our glorious flight;\nl
Our human state cradles the future god,\nl
Our mortal frailty an immortal force.\nl

He came into a realm of early Light\nl
And the regency of a half-risen sun.\nl
Out of its rays our mind's full orb was born.\nl
Appointed by the Spirit of the Worlds\nl
To mediate with the unknowing depths,\nl
A prototypal deft Intelligence\nl
Half-poised on equal wings of thought and doubt\nl
Toiled ceaselessly twixt being's hidden ends.\nl
A Secrecy breathed in life's moving act;\nl
A covert nurse of Nature's miracles,\nl
It shaped life's wonders out of Matter's mud:\nl
It cut the pattern of the shapes of things,\nl
It pitched mind's tent in the vague ignorant Vast.\nl
A master Magician of measure and device\nl
Has made an eternity from recurring forms\nl
And to the wandering spectator thought\nl
Assigned a seat on the inconscient stage.\nl
On earth by the will of this Arch-Intelligence\nl
A bodiless energy put on Matter's robe;\nl
Proton and photon served the imager Eye\nl
To change things subtle into a physical world\nl
And the invisible appeared as shape\nl
And the impalpable was felt as mass:\nl
Magic of percept joined with concept's art\nl
And lent to each object an interpreting name:\nl
Idea was disguised in a body's artistry,\nl
And by a strange atomic law's mystique\nl
A frame was made in which the sense could put\nl
Its symbol picture of the universe.\nl
Even a greater miracle was done.\nl
The mediating light linked body's power,\nl
The sleep and dreaming of the tree and plant,\nl
The animal's vibrant sense, the thought in man,\nl

Its skill endorsing Matter's right to think\nl

A mummified mnemonic alphabet,\nl
It helped the unseeing Force to read her works.\nl
A buried consciousness arose in her\nl
And now she dreams herself human and awake.\nl
But all was still a mobile Ignorance;\nl
Still Knowledge could not come and firmly grasp\nl
This huge invention seen as a universe.\nl
A specialist of logic's hard machine\nl
Imposed its rigid artifice on the soul;\nl
An aide of the inventor intellect,\nl
It cut Truth into manageable bits\nl
That each might have his ration of thought-food,\nl
Then new-built Truth's slain body by its art:\nl
A robot exact and serviceable and false\nl
Displaced the spirit's finer view of things:\nl
A polished engine did the work of a god.\nl
None the true body found, its soul seemed dead:\nl
None had the inner look which sees Truth's whole;\nl
All glorified the glittering substitute.\nl
Then from the secret heights a wave swept down,\nl
A brilliant chaos of rebel light arose;\nl
It looked above and saw the dazzling peaks,\nl
It looked within and woke the sleeping god.\nl
Imagination called her shining squads\nl
That venture into undiscovered scenes\nl
Where all the marvels lurk none yet has known:\nl
Lifting her beautiful and miraculous head,\nl
She conspired with inspiration's sister brood\nl
To fill thought's skies with glimmering nebulae.\nl
A bright Error fringed the mystery-altar's frieze;\nl
Darkness grew nurse to wisdom's occult sun,\nl
Myth suckled knowledge with her lustrous milk;\nl
Page 242

The infant passed from dim to radiant breasts.\nl
Thus worked the Power upon the growing world;\nl
Its subtle craft withheld the full-orbed blaze,\nl
Cherished the soul's childhood and on fictions fed\nl
Far richer in their sweet and nectarous sap\nl
Nourishing its immature divinity\nl
Than the staple or dry straw of Reason's tilth,\nl
Its heaped fodder of innumerable facts,\nl
Plebeian fare on which today we thrive.\nl
Thus streamed down from the realm of early Light\nl
Ethereal thinkings into Matter's world;\nl
Its gold-horned herds trooped into earth's cave-heart.\nl
Its morning rays illume our twilight's eyes,\nl
Its young formations move the mind of earth\nl
To labour and to dream and new-create,\nl
To feel beauty's touch and know the world and self:\nl
The Golden Child began to think and see.\nl

\spar In those bright realms are Mind's first forward steps.\nl
Ignorant of all but eager to know all,\nl
Its curious slow enquiry there begins;\nl
Ever its searching grasps at shapes around,\nl
Ever it hopes to find out greater things.\nl
Ardent and golden-gleamed with sunrise fires,\nl
Alert it lives upon invention's verge.\nl
Yet all it does is on an infant's scale,\nl
As if the cosmos were a nursery game,\nl
Mind, life the playthings of a Titan's babe.\nl
As one it works who builds a mimic fort\nl
Miraculously stable for a while,\nl
Made of the sands upon a bank of Time\nl
Mid an occult eternity's shoreless sea.\nl
A small keen instrument the great Puissance chose,\nl
An arduous pastime passionately pursues;\nl
To teach the Ignorance is her difficult charge,\nl
Her thought starts from an original nescient Void\nl
Page 243

And what she teaches she herself must learn\nl
Arousing knowledge from its sleepy lair.\nl
For knowledge comes not to us as a guest\nl
Called into our chamber from the outer world;\nl
A friend and inmate of our secret self,\nl
It hid behind our minds and fell asleep\nl
And slowly wakes beneath the blows of life;\nl
The mighty daemon lies unshaped within,\nl
To evoke, to give it form is Nature's task.\nl
All was a chaos of the true and false,\nl
Mind sought amid deep mists of Nescience;\nl
It looked within itself but saw not God.\nl
A material interim diplomacy\nl
Denied the Truth that transient truths might live\nl
And hid the Deity in creed and guess\nl
That the World-Ignorance might grow slowly wise.\nl
This was the imbroglio made by sovereign Mind\nl
Looking from a gleam-ridge into the Night\nl
In her first tamperings with Inconscience:\nl
Its alien dusk baffles her luminous eyes;\nl
Her rapid hands must learn a cautious zeal;\nl
Only a slow advance the earth can bear.\nl
Yet was her strength unlike the unseeing earth's\nl
Compelled to handle makeshift instruments\nl
Invented by the life-force and the flesh.\nl
Earth all perceives through doubtful images,\nl
All she conceives in hazardous jets of sight,\nl
Small lights kindled by touches of groping thought.\nl
Incapable of the soul's direct inlook\nl
She sees by spasms and solders knowledge-scrap,\nl
Makes Truth the slave-girl of her indigence,\nl
Expelling Nature's mystic unity\nl
Cuts into quantum and mass the moving All;\nl
She takes for measuring-rod her ignorance.\nl
In her own domain a pontiff and a seer,\nl
That greater Power with her half-risen sun\nl
Page 244

Wrought within limits but possessed her field;\nl
She knew by a privilege of thinking force\nl
And claimed an infant sovereignty of sight.\nl
In her eyes however darkly fringed was lit\nl
The Archangel's gaze who knows inspired his acts\nl
And shapes a world in its far-seeing flame.\nl
In her own realm she stumbles not nor fails,\nl
But moves in boundaries of subtle power\nl
Across which mind can step towards the sun.\nl
A candidate for a higher suzerainty,\nl
A passage she cut through from Night to Light,\nl
And searched for an ungrasped Omniscience.\nl

\spar A dwarf three-bodied trinity was her serf.\nl
First, smallest of the three, but strong of limb,\nl
A low-brow with a square and heavy jowl,\nl
A pigmy Thought needing to live in bounds\nl
For ever stooped to hammer fact and form.\nl
Absorbed and cabined in external sight,\nl
It takes its stand on Nature's solid base.\nl
A technician admirable, a thinker crude,\nl
A riveter of Life to habit's grooves,\nl
Obedient to gross Matter's tyranny,\nl
A prisoner of the moulds in which it works,\nl
It binds itself by what itself creates.\nl
A slave of a fixed mass of absolute rules,\nl
It sees as Law the habits of the world,\nl
It sees as Truth the habits of the mind.\nl
In its realm of concrete images and events\nl
Turning in a worn circle of ideas\nl
And ever repeating old familiar acts,\nl
It lives content with the common and the known.\nl
It loves the old ground that was its dwelling-place:\nl
Abhorring change as an audacious sin,\nl
Distrustful of each new discovery\nl
Only it advances step by careful step\nl
Page 245

And fears as if a deadly abyss the unknown.\nl
A prudent treasurer of its ignorance,\nl
It shrinks from adventure, blinks at glorious hope,\nl
Preferring a safe foothold upon things\nl
To the dangerous joy of wideness and of height.\nl
The world's slow impressions on its labouring mind,\nl
Tardy imprints almost indelible,\nl
Increase their value by their poverty;\nl
The old sure memories are its capital stock:\nl
Only what sense can grasp seems absolute:\nl
External fact it figures as sole truth,\nl
Wisdom identifies with the earthward look,\nl
And things long known and actions always done\nl
Are to its clinging hold a balustrade\nl
Of safety on the perilous stair of Time.\nl
Heaven's trust to it are the established ancient ways,\nl
Immutable laws man has no right to change,\nl
A sacred legacy from the great dead past\nl
Or the one road that God has made for life,\nl
A firm shape of Nature never to be changed,\nl
Part of the huge routine of the universe.\nl
A smile from the Preserver of the Worlds\nl
Sent down of old this guardian Mind to earth\nl
That all might stand in their fixed changeless type\nl
And from their secular posture never move.\nl
One sees it circling faithful to its task,\nl
Tireless in an assigned tradition's round;\nl
In decayed and crumbling offices of Time\nl
It keeps close guard in front of custom's wall,\nl
Or in an ancient Night's dim environs\nl
It dozes on a little courtyard's stones\nl
And barks at every unfamiliar light\nl
As at a foe who would break up its home,\nl
A watch-dog of the spirit's sense-railed house\nl
Against intruders from the Invisible,\nl
Nourished on scraps of life and Matter's bones\nl
Page 246

In its kennel of objective certitude.\nl
And yet behind it stands a cosmic might:\nl
A measured Greatness keeps its vaster plan,\nl
A fathomless sameness rhythms the tread of life;\nl
The stars' changeless orbits furrow inert Space,\nl
A million species follow one mute Law.\nl
A huge inertness is the world's defence,\nl
Even in change is treasured changelessness;\nl
Into inertia revolution sinks,\nl
In a new dress the old resumes its role;\nl
The Energy acts, the stable is its seal:\nl
On Shiva's breast is stayed the enormous dance.\nl
\sparn A fiery spirit came, next of the three.\nl
A hunchback rider of the red Wild-Ass,\nl
A rash Intelligence leaped down lion-maned\nl
From the great mystic Flame that rings the worlds\nl
And with its dire edge eats at being's heart.\nl
Thence sprang the burning vision of Desire.\nl
A thousand shapes it wore, took numberless names:\nl
A need of multitude and uncertainty\nl
Pricks it for ever to pursue the One\nl
On countless roads across the vasts of Time\nl
Through circuits of unending difference.\nl
It burns all breasts with an ambiguous fire.\nl
A radiance gleaming on a murky stream,\nl
It flamed towards heaven, then sank, engulfed, towards hell;\nl
It climbed to drag down Truth into the mire\nl
And used for muddy ends its brilliant Force;\nl
A huge chameleon gold and blue and red\nl
Turning to black and grey and lurid brown,\nl
Hungry it stared from a mottled bough of life\nl
To snap up insect joys, its favourite food,\nl
The dingy sustenance of a sumptuous frame\nl
Nursing the splendid passion of its hues.\nl
A snake of flame with a dull cloud for tail,\nl
Followed by a dream-brood of glittering thoughts,\nl
Page 247

A lifted head with many-tinged flickering crests,\nl
It licked at knowledge with a smoky tongue.\nl
A whirlpool sucking in an empty air,\nl
It based on vacancy stupendous claims,\nl
In Nothingness born to Nothingness returned,\nl
Yet all the time unwittingly it drove\nl
Towards the hidden Something that is All.\nl
Ardent to find, incapable to retain,\nl
A brilliant instability was its mark,\nl
To err its inborn trend, its native cue.\nl
At once to an unreflecting credence prone,\nl
It thought all true that flattered its own hopes;\nl
It cherished golden nothings born of wish,\nl
It snatched at the unreal for provender.\nl
In darkness it discovered luminous shapes;\nl
Peering into a shadow-hung half-light\nl
It saw hued images scrawled on Fancy's cave;\nl
Or it swept in circles through conjecture's night\nl
And caught in imagination's camera\nl
Bright scenes of promise held by transient flares,\nl
Fixed in life's air the feet of hurrying dreams,\nl
Kept prints of passing Forms and hooded Powers\nl
And flash-images of half-seen verities.\nl
An eager spring to seize and to possess\nl
Unguided by reason or the seeing soul\nl
Was its first natural motion and its last,\nl
It squandered life's force to achieve the impossible:\nl
It scorned the straight road and ran on wandering curves\nl
And left what it had won for untried things;\nl
It saw unrealised aims as instant fate\nl
And chose the precipice for its leap to heaven.\nl
Adventure its system in the gamble of life,\nl
It took fortuitous gains as safe results;\nl
Error discouraged not its confident view\nl
Ignorant of the deep law of being's ways\nl
And failure could not slow its fiery clutch;\nl
Page 248

One chance made true warranted all the rest.\nl
Attempt, not victory, was the charm of life.\nl
An uncertain winner of uncertain stakes,\nl
Instinct its dam and the life-mind its sire,\nl
It ran its race and came in first or last.\nl
Yet were its works nor small and vain nor null;\nl
It nursed a portion of infinity's strength\nl
And could create the high things its fancy willed;\nl
Its passion caught what calm intelligence missed.\nl
Insight of impulse laid its leaping grasp\nl
On heavens high Thought had hidden in dazzling mist,\nl
Caught glimmers that revealed a lurking sun:\nl
It probed the void and found a treasure there.\nl
A half-intuition purpled in its sense;\nl
It threw the lightning's fork and hit the unseen.\nl
It saw in the dark and vaguely blinked in the light,\nl
Ignorance was its field, the unknown its prize.\nl
\sparn Of all these Powers the greatest was the last.\nl
Arriving late from a far plane of thought\nl
Into a packed irrational world of Chance\nl
Where all was grossly felt and blindly done,\nl
Yet the haphazard seemed the inevitable,\nl
Came Reason, the squat godhead artisan,\nl
To her narrow house upon a ridge in Time.\nl
Adept of clear contrivance and design,\nl
A pensive face and close and peering eyes,\nl
She took her firm and irremovable seat,\nl
The strongest, wisest of the troll-like Three.\nl
Armed with her lens and measuring-rod and probe,\nl
She looked upon an object universe\nl
And the multitudes that in it live and die\nl
And the body of Space and the fleeing soul of Time,\nl
And took the earth and stars into her hands\nl
To try what she could make of these strange things.\nl
In her strong purposeful laborious mind,\nl
Inventing her scheme-lines of reality\nl
Page 249

And the geometric curves of her time-plan,\nl
She multiplied her slow half-cuts at Truth:\nl
Impatient of enigma and the unknown,\nl
Intolerant of the lawless and the unique,\nl
Imposing reflection on the march of Force,\nl
Imposing clarity on the unfathomable,\nl
She strove to reduce to rules the mystic world.\nl
Nothing she knew but all things hoped to know.\nl
In dark inconscient realms once void of thought,\nl
Missioned by a supreme Intelligence\nl
To throw its ray upon the obscure Vast,\nl
An imperfect light leading an erring mass\nl
By the power of sense and the idea and word,\nl
She ferrets out Nature's process, substance, cause.\nl
All life to harmonise by thought's control,\nl
She with the huge imbroglio struggles still;\nl
Ignorant of all but her own seeking mind\nl
To save the world from Ignorance she came.\nl
A sovereign worker through the centuries\nl
Observing and remoulding all that is,\nl
Confident she took up her stupendous charge.\nl
There the low bent and mighty figure sits\nl
Bowed under the arc-lamps of her factory home\nl
Amid the clatter and ringing of her tools.\nl
A rigorous stare in her creative eyes\nl
Coercing the plastic stuff of cosmic Mind,\nl
She sets the hard inventions of her brain\nl
In a pattern of eternal fixity:\nl
Indifferent to the cosmic dumb demand,\nl
Unconscious of too close realities,\nl
Of the unspoken thought, the voiceless heart,\nl
She leans to forge her credos and iron codes\nl
And metal structures to imprison life\nl
And mechanic models of all things that are.\nl
For the world seen she weaves a world conceived:\nl
She spins in stiff but unsubstantial lines\nl
Page 250

Her gossamer word-webs of abstract thought,\nl
Her segment systems of the Infinite,\nl
Her theodicies and cosmogonic charts\nl
And myths by which she explains the inexplicable.\nl
At will she spaces in thin air of mind\nl
Like maps in the school-house of intellect hung,\nl
Forcing wide Truth into a narrow scheme,\nl
Her numberless warring strict philosophies;\nl
Out of Nature's body of phenomenon\nl
She carves with Thought's keen edge in rigid lines,\nl
Like rails for the World-Magician's power to run,\nl
Her sciences precise and absolute.\nl
On the huge bare walls of human nescience\nl
Written round Nature's deep dumb hieroglyphs\nl
She pens in clear demotic characters\nl
The vast encyclopaedia of her thoughts;\nl
An algebra of her mathematics' signs,\nl
Her numbers and unerring formulas\nl
She builds to clinch her summary of things.\nl
On all sides runs as if in a cosmic mosque\nl
Tracing the scriptural verses of her laws\nl
The daedal of her patterned arabesques,\nl
Art of her wisdom, artifice of her lore.\nl
This art, this artifice are her only stock.\nl
In her high works of pure intelligence,\nl
In her withdrawal from the senses' trap,\nl
There comes no breaking of the walls of mind,\nl
There leaps no rending flash of absolute power,\nl
There dawns no light of heavenly certitude.\nl
A million faces wears her knowledge here\nl
And every face is turbaned with a doubt.\nl
All now is questioned, all reduced to nought.\nl
Once monumental in their massive craft\nl
Her old great mythic writings disappear\nl
And into their place start strict ephemeral signs;\nl
This constant change spells progress to her eyes:\nl
Page 251

Her thought is an endless march without a goal.\nl
There is no summit on which she can stand\nl
And see in a single glance the Infinite's whole.\nl
\sparn An inconclusive play is Reason's toil.\nl
Each strong idea can use her as its tool;\nl
Accepting every brief she pleads her case.\nl
Open to every thought, she cannot know.\nl
The eternal Advocate seated as judge\nl
Armours in logic's invulnerable mail\nl
A thousand combatants for Truth's veiled throne\nl
And sets on a high horse-back of argument\nl
To tilt for ever with a wordy lance\nl
In a mock tournament where none can win.\nl
Assaying thought's values with her rigid tests\nl
Balanced she sits on wide and empty air,\nl
Aloof and pure in her impartial poise.\nl
Absolute her judgments seem but none is sure;\nl
Time cancels all her verdicts in appeal.\nl
Although like sunbeams to our glow-worm mind\nl
Her knowledge feigns to fall from a clear heaven,\nl
Its rays are a lantern's lustres in the Night;\nl
She throws a glittering robe on Ignorance.\nl
But now is lost her ancient sovereign claim\nl
To rule mind's high realm in her absolute right,\nl
Bind thought with logic's forged infallible chain\nl
Or see truth nude in a bright abstract haze.\nl
A master and slave of stark phenomenon,\nl
She travels on the roads of erring sight\nl
Or looks upon a set mechanical world\nl
Constructed for her by her instruments.\nl
A bullock yoked in the cart of proven fact,\nl
She drags huge knowledge-bales through Matter's dust\nl
To reach utility's immense bazaar.\nl
Apprentice she has grown to her old drudge;\nl
An aided sense is her seeking's arbiter.\nl
This now she uses as the assayer's stone.\nl
Page 252

As if she knew not facts are husks of truth,\nl
The husks she keeps, the kernel throws aside.\nl
An ancient wisdom fades into the past,\nl
The ages' faith becomes an idle tale,\nl
God passes out of the awakened thought,\nl
An old discarded dream needed no more:\nl
Only she seeks mechanic Nature's keys.\nl
Interpreting stone-laws inevitable\nl
She digs into Matter's hard concealing soil,\nl
To unearth the processes of all things done.\nl
A loaded huge self-worked machine appears\nl
To her eye's eager and admiring stare,\nl
An intricate and meaningless enginery\nl
Of ordered fateful and unfailing Chance:\nl
Ingenious and meticulous and minute,\nl
Its brute unconscious accurate device\nl
Unrolls an unerring march, maps a sure road;\nl
It plans without thinking, acts without a will,\nl
A million purposes serves with purpose none\nl
And builds a rational world without a mind.\nl
It has no mover, no maker, no idea:\nl
Its vast self-action toils without a cause;\nl
A lifeless Energy irresistibly driven,\nl
Death's head on the body of Necessity,\nl
Engenders life and fathers consciousness,\nl
Then wonders why all was and whence it came.\nl
Our thoughts are parts of the immense machine,\nl
Our ponderings but a freak of Matter's law,\nl
The mystic's lore was a fancy or a blind;\nl
Of soul or spirit we have now no need:\nl
Matter is the admirable Reality,\nl
The patent unescapable miracle,\nl
The hard truth of things, simple, eternal, sole.\nl
A suicidal rash expenditure\nl
Creating the world by a mystery of self-loss\nl
Has poured its scattered works on empty Space;\nl
Page 253

Late shall the self-disintegrating Force\nl
Contract the immense expansion it has made:\nl
Then ends this mighty and unmeaning toil,\nl
The Void is left bare, vacant as before.\nl
Thus vindicated, crowned, the grand new Thought\nl
Explained the world and mastered all its laws,\nl
Touched the dumb roots, woke veiled tremendous powers;\nl
It bound to service the unconscious djinns\nl
That sleep unused in Matter's ignorant trance.\nl
All was precise, rigid, indubitable.\nl
But when on Matter's rock of ages based\nl
A whole stood up firm and clear-cut and safe,\nl
All staggered back into a sea of doubt;\nl
This solid scheme melted in endless flux:\nl
She had met the formless Power inventor of forms;\nl
Suddenly she stumbled upon things unseen:\nl
A lightning from the undiscovered Truth\nl
Startled her eyes with its perplexing glare\nl
And dug a gulf between the Real and Known\nl
Till all her knowledge seemed an ignorance.\nl
Once more the world was made a wonder-web,\nl
A magic's process in a magical space,\nl
An unintelligible miracle's depths\nl
Whose source is lost in the Ineffable.\nl
Once more we face the blank Unknowable.\nl
In a crash of values, in a huge doom-crack,\nl
In the sputter and scatter of her breaking work\nl
She lost her clear conserved constructed world.\nl
A quantum dance remained, a sprawl of chance\nl
In Energy's stupendous tripping whirl:\nl
A ceaseless motion in the unbounded Void\nl
Invented forms without a thought or aim:\nl
Necessity and Cause were shapeless ghosts;\nl
Matter was an incident in being's flow,\nl
Law but a clock-work habit of blind force.\nl
Ideals, ethics, systems had no base\nl
Page 254

And soon collapsed or without sanction lived;\nl
All grew a chaos, a heave and clash and strife.\nl
Ideas warring and fierce leaped upon life;\nl
A hard compression held down anarchy\nl
And liberty was only a phantom's name:\nl
Creation and destruction waltzed inarmed\nl
On the bosom of a torn and quaking earth;\nl
All reeled into a world of Kali's dance.\nl
Thus tumbled, sinking, sprawling in the Void,\nl
Clutching for props, a soil on which to stand,\nl
She only saw a thin atomic Vast,\nl
The rare-point sparse substratum universe\nl
On which floats a solid world's phenomenal face.\nl
Alone a process of events was there\nl
And Nature's plastic and protean change\nl
And, strong by death to slay or to create,\nl
The riven invisible atom's omnipotent force.\nl
One chance remained that here might be a power\nl
To liberate man from the old inadequate means\nl
And leave him sovereign of the earthly scene.\nl
For Reason then might grasp the original Force\nl
To drive her car upon the roads of Time.\nl
All then might serve the need of the thinking race,\nl
An absolute State found order's absolute,\nl
To a standardised perfection cut all things,\nl
In society build a just exact machine.\nl
Then science and reason careless of the soul\nl
Could iron out a tranquil uniform world,\nl
Aeonic seekings glut with outward truths\nl
And a single-patterned thinking force on mind,\nl
Inflicting Matter's logic on Spirit's dreams\nl
A reasonable animal make of man\nl
And a symmetrical fabric of his life.\nl
This would be Nature's peak on an obscure globe,\nl
The grand result of the long ages' toil,\nl
Earth's evolution crowned, her mission done.\nl
Page 255

So might it be if the spirit fell asleep;\nl
Man then might rest content and live in peace,\nl
Master of Nature who once her bondslave worked,\nl
The world's disorder hardening into Law,—\nl
If Life's dire heart arose not in revolt,\nl
If God within could find no greater plan.\nl
But many-visaged is the cosmic Soul;\nl
A touch can alter the fixed front of Fate.\nl
A sudden turn can come, a road appear.\nl
A greater Mind may see a greater Truth,\nl
Or we may find when all the rest has failed\nl
Hid in ourselves the key of perfect change.\nl
Ascending from the soil where creep our days,\nl
Earth's consciousness may marry with the Sun,\nl
Our mortal life ride on the spirit's wings,\nl
Our finite thoughts commune with the Infinite.\nl
\sparn In the bright kingdoms of the rising Sun\nl
All is a birth into a power of light:\nl
All here deformed guards there its happy shape,\nl
Here all is mixed and marred, there pure and whole;\nl
Yet each is a passing step, a moment's phase.\nl
Awake to a greater Truth beyond her acts,\nl
The mediatrix sat and saw her works\nl
And felt the marvel in them and the force\nl
But knew the power behind the face of Time:\nl
She did the task, obeyed the knowledge given,\nl
Her deep heart yearned towards great ideal things\nl
And from the light looked out to wider light:\nl
A brilliant hedge drawn round her narrowed her power;\nl
Faithful to her limited sphere she toiled, but knew\nl
Its highest, widest seeing was a half-search,\nl
Its mightiest acts a passage or a stage.\nl
For not by Reason was creation made\nl
And not by Reason can the Truth be seen\nl
Which through the veils of thought, the screens of sense\nl
Hardly the spirit's vision can descry\nl
Page 256

Dimmed by the imperfection of its means:\nl
The little Mind is tied to little things:\nl
Its sense is but the spirit's outward touch,\nl
Half-waked in a world of dark Inconscience;\nl
It feels out for its beings and its forms\nl
Like one left fumbling in the ignorant Night.\nl
In this small mould of infant mind and sense\nl
Desire is a child-heart's cry crying for bliss,\nl
Our reason only a toys' artificer,\nl
A rule-maker in a strange stumbling game.\nl
But she her dwarf aides knew whose confident sight\nl
A bounded prospect took for the far goal.\nl
The world she has made is an interim report\nl
Of a traveller towards the half-found truth in things\nl
Moving twixt nescience and nescience.\nl
For nothing is known while aught remains concealed;\nl
The Truth is known only when all is seen.\nl
Attracted by the All that is the One,\nl
She yearns towards a higher light than hers;\nl
Hid by her cults and creeds she has glimpsed God's face:\nl
She knows she has but found a form, a robe,\nl
But ever she hopes to see him in her heart\nl
And feel the body of his reality.\nl
As yet a mask is there and not a brow,\nl
Although sometimes two hidden eyes appear:\nl
Reason cannot tear off that glimmering mask,\nl
Her efforts only make it glimmer more;\nl
In packets she ties up the Indivisible;\nl
Finding her hands too small to hold vast Truth\nl
She breaks up knowledge into alien parts\nl
Or peers through cloud-rack for a vanished sun:\nl
She sees, not understanding what she has seen,\nl
Through the locked visages of finite things\nl
The myriad aspects of infinity.\nl
One day the Face must burn out through the mask.\nl
Our ignorance is Wisdom's chrysalis,\nl
Page 257

Our error weds new knowledge on its way,\nl
Its darkness is a blackened knot of light;\nl
Thought dances hand in hand with Nescience\nl
On the grey road that winds towards the Sun.\nl
Even while her fingers fumble at the knots\nl
Which bind them to their strange companionship,\nl
Into the moments of their married strife\nl
Sometimes break flashes of the enlightening Fire.\nl
Even now great thoughts are here that walk alone:\nl
Armed they have come with the infallible word\nl
In an investiture of intuitive light\nl
That is a sanction from the eyes of God;\nl
Announcers of a distant Truth they flame\nl
Arriving from the rim of eternity.\nl
A fire shall come out of the infinitudes,\nl
A greater Gnosis shall regard the world\nl
Crossing out of some far omniscience\nl
On lustrous seas from the still rapt Alone\nl
To illumine the deep heart of self and things.\nl
A timeless knowledge it shall bring to Mind,\nl
Its aim to life, to Ignorance its close.\nl

\spar Above in a high breathless stratosphere,\nl
Overshadowing the dwarfish trinity,\nl
Lived, aspirants to a limitless Beyond,\nl
Captives of Space, walled by the limiting heavens,\nl
In the unceasing circuit of the hours\nl
Yearning for the straight paths of eternity,\nl
And from their high station looked down on this world\nl
Two sun-gaze Daemons witnessing all that is.\nl
A power to uplift the laggard world,\nl
Imperious rode a huge high-winged Life-Thought\nl
Unwont to tread the firm unchanging soil:\nl
Accustomed to a blue infinity,\nl
It planed in sunlit sky and starlit air;\nl
It saw afar the unreached Immortal's home\nl
Page 258

And heard afar the voices of the Gods.\nl
Iconoclast and shatterer of Time's forts,\nl
Overleaping limit and exceeding norm,\nl
It lit the thoughts that glow through the centuries\nl
And moved to acts of superhuman force.\nl
As far as its self-winged air-planes could fly,\nl
Visiting the future in great brilliant raids\nl
It reconnoitred vistas of dream-fate.\nl
Apt to conceive, unable to attain,\nl
It drew its concept-maps and vision-plans\nl
Too large for the architecture of mortal Space.\nl
Beyond in wideness where no footing is,\nl
An imagist of bodiless Ideas,\nl
Impassive to the cry of life and sense,\nl
A pure Thought-Mind surveyed the cosmic act.\nl
Archangel of a white transcending realm,\nl
It saw the world from solitary heights\nl
Luminous in a remote and empty air.\nl

\par
\sbigcap There ceased the limits of the labouring Power.\nl
But being and creation cease not there.\nl
For Thought transcends the circles of mortal mind,\nl
It is greater than its earthly instrument:\nl
The godhead crammed into mind's narrow space\nl
Escapes on every side into some vast\nl
That is a passage to infinity.\nl
It moves eternal in the spirit's field,\nl
A runner towards the far spiritual light,\nl
A child and servant of the spirit's force.\nl
But mind too falls back from a nameless peak.\nl
His being stretched beyond the sight of Thought.\nl
For the spirit is eternal and unmade\nl
And not by thinking was its greatness born,\nl
And not by thinking can its knowledge come.\nl
It knows itself and in itself it lives,\nl
It moves where no thought is nor any form.\nl
Its feet are steadied upon finite things,\nl
Its wings can dare to cross the Infinite.\nl
Arriving into his ken a wonder space\nl
Of great and marvellous meetings called his steps,\nl
Where Thought leaned on a Vision beyond thought\nl
And shaped a world from the Unthinkable.\nl
On peaks imagination cannot tread,\nl
In the horizons of a tireless sight,\nl
Under a blue veil of eternity\nl
The splendours of ideal Mind were seen\nl
Outstretched across the boundaries of things known.\nl
Origin of the little that we are,\nl
Instinct with the endless more that we must be,\nl
A prop of all that human strength enacts,\nl
Page 260

Creator of hopes by earth unrealised,\nl
It spreads beyond the expanding universe;\nl
It wings beyond the boundaries of Dream,\nl
It overtops the ceiling of life's soar.\nl
Awake in a luminous sphere unbound by Thought,\nl
Exposed to omniscient immensities,\nl
It casts on our world its great crowned influences,\nl
Its speed that outstrips the ambling of the hours,\nl
Its force that strides invincibly through Time,\nl
Its mights that bridge the gulf twixt man and God,\nl
Its lights that combat Ignorance and Death.\nl
In its vast ambit of ideal Space\nl
Where beauty and mightiness walk hand in hand,\nl
The Spirit's truths take form as living Gods\nl
And each can build a world in its own right.\nl
In an air which doubt and error cannot mark\nl
With the stigmata of their deformity,\nl
In communion with the musing privacy\nl
Of a truth that sees in an unerring light\nl
Where the sight falters not nor wanders thought,\nl
Exempt from our world's exorbitant tax of tears,\nl
Dreaming its luminous creations gaze\nl
On the Ideas that people eternity.\nl
In a sun-blaze of joy and absolute power\nl
Above the Masters of the Ideal throne\nl
In sessions of secure felicity,\nl
In regions of illumined certitude.\nl
Far are those realms from our labour and yearning and call,\nl
Perfection's reign and hallowed sanctuary\nl
Closed to the uncertain thoughts of human mind,\nl
Remote from the turbid tread of mortal life.\nl
But since our secret selves are next of kin,\nl
A breath of unattained divinity\nl
Visits the imperfect earth on which we toil;\nl
Across a gleaming ether's golden laugh\nl
A light falls on our vexed unsatisfied lives,\nl
Page 261

A thought comes down from the ideal worlds\nl
And moves us to new-model even here\nl
Some image of their greatness and appeal\nl
And wonder beyond the ken of mortal hope.\nl
Amid the heavy sameness of the days\nl
And contradicted by the human law,\nl
A faith in things that are not and must be\nl
Lives comrade of this world's delight and pain,\nl
The child of the secret soul's forbidden desire\nl
Born of its amour with eternity.\nl
Our spirits break free from their environment;\nl
The future brings its face of miracle near,\nl
Its godhead looks at us with present eyes;\nl
Acts deemed impossible grow natural;\nl
We feel the hero's immortality;\nl
The courage and the strength death cannot touch\nl
Awake in limbs that are mortal, hearts that fail;\nl
We move by the rapid impulse of a will\nl
That scorns the tardy trudge of mortal time.\nl
These promptings come not from an alien sphere:\nl
Ourselves are citizens of that mother State,\nl
Adventurers, we have colonised Matter's night.\nl
But now our rights are barred, our passports void;\nl
We live self-exiled from our heavenlier home.\nl
An errant ray from the immortal Mind\nl
Accepted the earth's blindness and became\nl
Our human thought, servant of Ignorance.\nl
An exile, labourer on this unsure globe\nl
Captured and driven in Life's nescient grasp,\nl
Hampered by obscure cell and treacherous nerve,\nl
It dreams of happier states and nobler powers,\nl
The natural privilege of unfallen gods,\nl
Recalling still its old lost sovereignty.\nl
Amidst earth's mist and fog and mud and stone\nl
It still remembers its exalted sphere\nl
And the high city of its splendid birth.\nl
Page 262

A memory steals in from lost heavens of Truth,\nl
A wide release comes near, a Glory calls,\nl
A might looks out, an estranged felicity.\nl
In glamorous passages of half-veiled light\nl
Wandering, a brilliant shadow of itself,\nl
This quick uncertain leader of blind gods,\nl
This tender of small lamps, this minister serf\nl
Hired by a mind and body for earth-use\nl
Forgets its work mid crude realities;\nl
It recovers its renounced imperial right,\nl
It wears once more a purple robe of thought\nl
And knows itself the Ideal's seer and king,\nl
Communicant and prophet of the Unborn,\nl
Heir to delight and immortality.\nl
All things are real that here are only dreams,\nl
In our unknown depths sleeps their reserve of truth,\nl
On our unreached heights they reign and come to us\nl
In thought and muse trailing their robes of light.\nl
But our dwarf will and cold pragmatic sense\nl
Admit not the celestial visitants:\nl
Awaiting us on the Ideal's peaks\nl
Or guarded in our secret self unseen\nl
Yet flashed sometimes across the awakened soul,\nl
Hide from our lives their greatness, beauty, power.\nl
Our present feels sometimes their regal touch,\nl
Our future strives towards their luminous thrones:\nl
Out of spiritual secrecy they gaze,\nl
Immortal footfalls in mind's corridors sound:\nl
Our souls can climb into the shining planes,\nl
The breadths from which they came can be our home.\nl
His privilege regained of shadowless sight\nl
The Thinker entered the immortals' air\nl
And drank again his pure and mighty source.\nl
Immutable in rhythmic calm and joy\nl
He saw, sovereignly free in limitless light,\nl
The unfallen planes, the thought-created worlds\nl
Page 263

Where Knowledge is the leader of the act\nl
And Matter is of thinking substance made,\nl
Feeling, a heaven-bird poised on dreaming wings,\nl
Answers Truth's call as to a parent's voice,\nl
Form luminous leaps from the all-shaping beam\nl
And Will is a conscious chariot of the Gods,\nl
And Life, a splendour stream of musing Force,\nl
Carries the voices of the mystic Suns.\nl
A happiness it brings of whispered truth;\nl
There runs in its flow honeying the bosom of Space\nl
A laughter from the immortal heart of Bliss,\nl
And the unfathomed Joy of timelessness,\nl
The sound of Wisdom's murmur in the Unknown\nl
And the breath of an unseen Infinity.\nl
In gleaming clarities of amethyst air\nl
The chainless and omnipotent Spirit of Mind\nl
Brooded on the blue lotus of the Idea.\nl
A gold supernal sun of timeless Truth\nl
Poured down the mystery of the eternal Ray\nl
Through a silence quivering with the word of Light\nl
On an endless ocean of discovery.\nl
Far-off he saw the joining hemispheres.\nl
On meditation's mounting edge of trance\nl
Great stairs of thought climbed up to unborn heights\nl
Where Time's last ridges touch eternity's skies\nl
And Nature speaks to the spirit's absolute.\nl

\spar A triple realm of ordered thought came first,\nl
A small beginning of immense ascent:\nl
Above were bright ethereal skies of mind,\nl
A packed and endless soar as if sky pressed sky\nl
Buttressed against the Void on bastioned light;\nl
The highest strove to neighbour eternity,\nl
The largest widened into the infinite.\nl
But though immortal, mighty and divine,\nl
The first realms were close and kin to human mind;\nl
Page 264

Their deities shape our greater thinking's roads,\nl
A fragment of their puissance can be ours:\nl
These breadths were not too broad for our souls to range,\nl
These heights were not too high for human hope.\nl
A triple flight led to this triple world.\nl
Although abrupt for common strengths to tread,\nl
Its upward slope looks down on our earth-poise:\nl
On a slant not too precipitously steep\nl
One could turn back travelling deep descending lines\nl
To commune with the mortal's universe.\nl
The mighty wardens of the ascending stair\nl
Who intercede with the all-creating Word,\nl
There waited for the pilgrim heaven-bound soul;\nl
Holding the thousand keys of the Beyond\nl
They proffered their knowledge to the climbing mind\nl
And filled the life with Thought's immensities.\nl
The prophet hierophants of the occult Law,\nl
The flame-bright hierarchs of the divine Truth,\nl
Interpreters between man's mind and God's,\nl
They bring the immortal fire to mortal men.\nl
Iridescent, bodying the invisible,\nl
The guardians of the Eternal's bright degrees\nl
Fronted the Sun in radiant phalanxes.\nl
Afar they seemed a symbol imagery,\nl
Illumined originals of the shadowy script\nl
In which our sight transcribes the ideal Ray,\nl
Or icons figuring a mystic Truth,\nl
But, nearer, Gods and living Presences.\nl
A march of friezes marked the lowest steps;\nl
Fantastically ornate and richly small,\nl
They had room for the whole meaning of a world,\nl
Symbols minute of its perfection's joy,\nl
Strange beasts that were Nature's forces made alive\nl
And, wakened to the wonder of his role,\nl
Man grown an image undefaced of God\nl
And objects the fine coin of Beauty's reign;\nl
Page 265

But wide the terrains were those levels serve.\nl
In front of the ascending epiphany\nl
World-Time's enjoyers, favourites of World-Bliss,\nl
The Masters of things actual, lords of the hours,\nl
Playmates of youthful Nature and child God,\nl
Creators of Matter by hid stress of Mind\nl
Whose subtle thoughts support unconscious Life\nl
And guide the fantasy of brute events,\nl
Stood there, a race of young keen-visioned gods,\nl
King-children born on Wisdom's early plane,\nl
Taught in her school world-making's mystic play.\nl
Archmasons of the eternal Thaumaturge,\nl
Moulders and measurers of fragmented Space,\nl
They have made their plan of the concealed and known\nl
A dwelling-house for the invisible king.\nl
Obeying the Eternal's deep command\nl
They have built in the material front of things\nl
This wide world-kindergarten of young souls\nl
Where the infant spirit learns through mind and sense\nl
To read the letters of the cosmic script\nl
And study the body of the cosmic self\nl
And search for the secret meaning of the whole.\nl
To all that Spirit conceives they give a mould;\nl
Persuading Nature into visible moods\nl
They lend a finite shape to infinite things.\nl
Each power that leaps from the Unmanifest\nl
Leaving the largeness of the Eternal's peace\nl
They seized and held by their precisian eye\nl
And made a figurante in the cosmic dance.\nl
Its free caprice they bound by rhythmic laws\nl
And compelled to accept its posture and its line\nl
In the wizardry of an ordered universe.\nl
The All-containing was contained in form,\nl
Oneness was carved into units measurable,\nl
The limitless built into a cosmic sum:\nl
Unending Space was beaten into a curve,\nl
Page 266

Indivisible Time into small minutes cut,\nl
The infinitesimal massed to keep secure\nl
The mystery of the Formless cast into form.\nl
Invincibly their craft devised for use\nl
The magic of sequent number and sign's spell,\nl
Design's miraculous potency was caught\nl
Laden with beauty and significance\nl
And by the determining mandate of their gaze\nl
Figure and quality equating joined\nl
In an inextricable identity.\nl
On each event they stamped its curves of law\nl
And its trust and charge of burdened circumstance;\nl
A free and divine incident no more\nl
At each moment willed or adventure of the soul,\nl
It lengthened a fate-bound mysterious chain,\nl
A line foreseen of an immutable plan,\nl
One step more in Necessity's long march.\nl
A term was set for every eager Power\nl
Restraining its will to monopolise the world,\nl
A groove of bronze prescribed for force and act\nl
And shown to each moment its appointed place\nl
Forewilled inalterably in the spiral\nl
Huge Time-loop fugitive from eternity.\nl
Inevitable their thoughts like links of Fate\nl
Imposed on the leap and lightning race of mind\nl
And on the frail fortuitous flux of life\nl
And on the liberty of atomic things\nl
Immutable cause and adamant consequence.\nl
Idea gave up the plastic infinity\nl
To which it was born and now traced out instead\nl
Small separate steps of chain-work in a plot:\nl
Immortal once, now tied to birth and end,\nl
Torn from its immediacy of errorless sight,\nl
Knowledge was rebuilt from cells of inference\nl
Into a fixed body flasque and perishable;\nl
Thus bound it grew, but could not last and broke\nl
Page 267

And to a new thinking's body left its place.\nl
A cage for the Infinite's great-eyed seraphim Thoughts\nl
Was closed with a criss-cross of world-laws for bars\nl
And hedged into a curt horizon's arc\nl
The irised vision of the Ineffable.\nl
A timeless Spirit was made the slave of the hours;\nl
The Unbound was cast into a prison of birth\nl
To make a world that Mind could grasp and rule.\nl
On an earth which looked towards a thousand suns,\nl
That the created might grow Nature's lord\nl
And Matter's depths be illumined with a soul\nl
They tied to date and norm and finite scope\nl
The million-mysteried movement of the One.\nl
\sparn Above stood ranked a subtle archangel race\nl
With larger lids and looks that searched the unseen.\nl
A light of liberating knowledge shone\nl
Across the gulfs of silence in their eyes;\nl
They lived in the mind and knew truth from within;\nl
A sight withdrawn in the concentrated heart\nl
Could pierce behind the screen of Time's results\nl
And the rigid cast and shape of visible things.\nl
All that escaped conception's narrow noose\nl
Vision descried and gripped; their seeing thoughts\nl
Filled in the blanks left by the seeking sense.\nl
High architects of possibility\nl
And engineers of the impossible,\nl
Mathematicians of the infinitudes\nl
And theoricians of unknowable truths,\nl
They formulate enigma's postulates\nl
And join the unknown to the apparent worlds.\nl
Acolytes they wait upon the timeless Power,\nl
The cycle of her works investigate;\nl
Passing her fence of wordless privacy\nl
Their mind could penetrate her occult mind\nl
And draw the diagram of her secret thoughts;\nl
They read the codes and ciphers she had sealed,\nl
Page 268

Copies they made of all her guarded plans,\nl
For every turn of her mysterious course\nl
Assigned a reason and unchanging rule.\nl
The unseen grew visible to student eyes,\nl
Explained was the immense Inconscient's scheme,\nl
Audacious lines were traced upon the Void;\nl
The Infinite was reduced to square and cube.\nl
Arranging symbol and significance,\nl
Tracing the curve of a transcendent Power,\nl
They framed the cabbala of the cosmic Law,\nl
The balancing line discovered of Life's technique\nl
And structured her magic and her mystery.\nl
Imposing schemes of knowledge on the Vast\nl
They clamped to syllogisms of finite thought\nl
The free logic of an infinite Consciousness,\nl
Grammared the hidden rhythms of Nature's dance,\nl
Critiqued the plot of the drama of the worlds,\nl
Made figure and number a key to all that is:\nl
The psycho-analysis of cosmic Self\nl
Was traced, its secrets hunted down, and read\nl
The unknown pathology of the Unique.\nl
Assessed was the system of the probable,\nl
The hazard of fleeing possibilities,\nl
To account for the Actual's unaccountable sum,\nl
Necessity's logarithmic tables drawn,\nl
Cast into a scheme the triple act of the One.\nl
Unveiled, the abrupt invisible multitude\nl
Of forces whirling from the hands of Chance\nl
Seemed to obey some vast imperative:\nl
Their tangled motives worked out unity.\nl
A wisdom read their mind to themselves unknown,\nl
Their anarchy rammed into a formula\nl
And from their giant randomness of Force,\nl
Following the habit of their million paths,\nl
Distinguishing each faintest line and stroke\nl
Of a concealed unalterable design,\nl
Page 269

Out of the chaos of the Invisible's moods\nl
Derived the calculus of Destiny.\nl
In its bright pride of universal lore\nl
Mind's knowledge overtopped the Omniscient's power:\nl
The Eternal's winging eagle puissances\nl
Surprised in their untracked empyrean\nl
Stooped from their gyres to obey the beck of Thought:\nl
Each mysteried God forced to revealing form,\nl
Assigned his settled moves in Nature's game,\nl
Zigzagged at the gesture of a chess-player Will\nl
Across the chequerboard of cosmic Fate.\nl
In the wide sequence of Necessity's steps\nl
Predicted, every act and thought of God,\nl
Its values weighed by the accountant Mind,\nl
Checked in his mathematised omnipotence,\nl
Lost its divine aspect of miracle\nl
And was a figure in a cosmic sum.\nl
The mighty Mother's whims and lightning moods\nl
Arisen from her all-wise unruled delight\nl
In the freedom of her sweet and passionate breast,\nl
Robbed of their wonder were chained to a cause and aim;\nl
An idol of bronze replaced her mystic shape\nl
That captures the movements of the cosmic vasts,\nl
In the sketch precise of an ideal face\nl
Forgotten was her eyelashes' dream-print\nl
Carrying on their curve infinity's dreams,\nl
Lost the alluring marvel of her eyes;\nl
The surging wave-throbs of her vast sea-heart\nl
They bound to a theorem of ordered beats:\nl
Her deep designs which from herself she had veiled\nl
Bowed self-revealed in their confessional.\nl
For the birth and death of the worlds they fixed a date,\nl
The diameter of infinity was drawn,\nl
Measured the distant arc of the unseen heights\nl
And visualised the plumbless viewless depths,\nl
Till all seemed known that in all time could be.\nl
Page 270

All was coerced by number, name and form;\nl
Nothing was left untold, incalculable.\nl
Yet was their wisdom circled with a nought:\nl
Truths they could find and hold but not the one Truth:\nl
The Highest was to them unknowable.\nl
By knowing too much they missed the whole to be known:\nl
The fathomless heart of the world was left unguessed\nl
And the Transcendent kept its secrecy.\nl
\sparn In a sublimer and more daring soar\nl
To the wide summit of the triple stairs\nl
Bare steps climbed up like flaming rocks of gold\nl
Burning their way to a pure absolute sky.\nl
August and few the sovereign Kings of Thought\nl
Have made of Space their wide all-seeing gaze\nl
Surveying the enormous work of Time:\nl
A breadth of all-containing Consciousness\nl
Supported Being in a still embrace.\nl
Intercessors with a luminous Unseen,\nl
They capt in the long passage to the world\nl
The imperatives of the creator Self\nl
Obeyed by unknowing earth, by conscious heaven;\nl
Their thoughts are partners in its vast control.\nl
A great all-ruling Consciousness is there\nl
And Mind unwitting serves a higher Power;\nl
It is a channel, not the source of all.\nl
The cosmos is no accident in Time;\nl
There is a meaning in each play of Chance,\nl
There is a freedom in each face of Fate.\nl
A Wisdom knows and guides the mysteried world;\nl
A Truth-gaze shapes its beings and events;\nl
A Word self-born upon creation's heights,\nl
Voice of the Eternal in the temporal spheres,\nl
Prophet of the seeings of the Absolute,\nl
Sows the Idea's significance in Form\nl
And from that seed the growths of Time arise.\nl
On peaks beyond our ken the All-Wisdom sits:\nl
Page 271

A single and infallible look comes down,\nl
A silent touch from the supernal's air\nl
Awakes to ignorant knowledge in its acts\nl
The secret power in the inconscient depths,\nl
Compelling the blinded Godhead to emerge,\nl
Determining Necessity's nude dance\nl
As she passes through the circuit of the hours\nl
And vanishes from the chase of finite eyes\nl
Down circling vistas of aeonic Time.\nl
The unseizable forces of the cosmic whirl\nl
Bear in their bacchant limbs the fixity\nl
Of an original foresight that is Fate.\nl
Even Nature's ignorance is Truth's instrument;\nl
Our struggling ego cannot change her course:\nl
Yet is it a conscious power that moves in us,\nl
A seed-idea is parent of our acts\nl
And destiny the unrecognised child of Will.\nl
Infallibly by Truth's directing gaze\nl
All creatures here their secret self disclose,\nl
Forced to become what in themselves they hide.\nl
For He who Is grows manifest in the years\nl
And the slow Godhead shut within the cell\nl
Climbs from the plasm to immortality.\nl
But hidden, but denied to mortal grasp,\nl
Mystic, ineffable is the spirit's truth,\nl
Unspoken, caught only by the spirit's eye.\nl
When naked of ego and mind it hears the Voice;\nl
It looks through light to ever greater light\nl
And sees Eternity ensphering Life.\nl
This greater Truth is foreign to our thoughts;\nl
Where a free Wisdom works, they seek for a rule;\nl
Or we only see a tripping game of Chance\nl
Or a labour in chains forced by bound Nature's law,\nl
An absolutism of dumb unthinking Power.\nl
Audacious in their sense of God-born strength\nl
These dared to grasp with their thought Truth's absolute;\nl
Page 272

By an abstract purity of godless sight,\nl
By a percept nude, intolerant of forms,\nl
They brought to Mind what Mind could never reach\nl
And hoped to conquer Truth's supernal base.\nl
A stripped imperative of conceptual phrase\nl
Architectonic and inevitable\nl
Translated the unthinkable into thought:\nl
A silver-winged fire of naked subtle sense,\nl
An ear of mind withdrawn from the outward's rhymes\nl
Discovered the seed-sounds of the eternal Word,\nl
The rhythm and music heard that built the worlds,\nl
And seized in things the bodiless Will to be.\nl
The Illimitable they measured with number's rods\nl
And traced the last formula of limited things,\nl
In transparent systems bodied termless truths,\nl
The Timeless made accountable to Time\nl
And valued the incommensurable Supreme.\nl
To park and hedge the ungrasped infinitudes\nl
They erected absolute walls of thought and speech\nl
And made a vacuum to hold the One.\nl
In their sight they drove towards an empty peak,\nl
A mighty space of cold and sunlit air.\nl
To unify their task, excluding life\nl
Which cannot bear the nakedness of the Vast,\nl
They made a cipher of a multitude,\nl
In negation found the meaning of the All\nl
And in nothingness the absolute positive.\nl
A single law simplessed the cosmic theme,\nl
Compressing Nature into a formula;\nl
Their titan labour made all knowledge one,\nl
A mental algebra of the Spirit's ways,\nl
An abstract of the living Divinity.\nl
Here the mind's wisdom stopped; it felt complete;\nl
For nothing more was left to think or know:\nl
In a spiritual zero it sat throned\nl
And took its vast silence for the Ineffable.\nl
Page 273

\spar This was the play of the bright gods of Thought.\nl
Attracting into time the timeless Light,\nl
Imprisoning eternity in the hours,\nl
This they have planned, to snare the feet of Truth\nl
In an aureate net of concept and of phrase\nl
And keep her captive for the thinker's joy\nl
In his little world built of immortal dreams:\nl
There must she dwell mured in the human mind,\nl
An empress prisoner in her subject's house,\nl
Adored and pure and still on his heart's throne,\nl
His splendid property cherished and apart\nl
In the wall of silence of his secret muse,\nl
Immaculate in white virginity,\nl
The same for ever and for ever one,\nl
His worshipped changeless Goddess through all time.\nl
Or else, a faithful consort of his mind\nl
Assenting to his nature and his will,\nl
She sanctions and inspires his words and acts\nl
Prolonging their resonance through the listening years,\nl
Companion and recorder of his march\nl
Crossing a brilliant tract of thought and life\nl
Carved out of the eternity of Time.\nl
A witness to his high triumphant star,\nl
Her godhead servitor to a crowned Idea,\nl
He shall dominate by her a prostrate world;\nl
A warrant for his deeds and his beliefs,\nl
She attests his right divine to lead and rule.\nl
Or as a lover clasps his one beloved,\nl
Godhead of his life's worship and desire,\nl
Icon of his heart's sole idolatry,\nl
She now is his and must live for him alone:\nl
She has invaded him with her sudden bliss,\nl
An exhaustless marvel in his happy grasp,\nl
An allurement, a caught ravishing miracle.\nl
Her now he claims after long rapt pursuit,\nl
The one joy of his body and his soul:\nl
Page 274

Inescapable is her divine appeal,\nl
Her immense possession an undying thrill,\nl
An intoxication and an ecstasy:\nl
The passion of her self-revealing moods,\nl
A heavenly glory and variety,\nl
Makes ever new her body to his eyes,\nl
Or else repeats the first enchantment's touch,\nl
The luminous rapture of her mystic breasts\nl
And beautiful vibrant limbs a living field\nl
Of throbbing new discovery without end.\nl
A new beginning flowers in word and laugh,\nl
A new charm brings back the old extreme delight:\nl
He is lost in her, she is his heaven here.\nl
Truth smiled upon the gracious golden game.\nl
Out of her hushed eternal spaces leaned\nl
The great and boundless Goddess feigned to yield\nl
The sunlit sweetness of her secrecies.\nl
Incarnating her beauty in his clasp\nl
She gave for a brief kiss her immortal lips\nl
And drew to her bosom one glorified mortal head:\nl
She made earth her home, for whom heaven was too small.\nl
In a human breast her occult presence lived;\nl
He carved from his own self his figure of her:\nl
She shaped her body to a mind's embrace.\nl
Into thought's narrow limits she has come;\nl
Her greatness she has suffered to be pressed\nl
Into the little cabin of the Idea,\nl
The closed room of a lonely thinker's grasp:\nl
She has lowered her heights to the stature of our souls\nl
And dazzled our lids with her celestial gaze.\nl
Thus each is satisfied with his high gain\nl
And thinks himself beyond mortality blest,\nl
A king of truth upon his separate throne.\nl
To her possessor in the field of Time\nl
A single splendour caught from her glory seems\nl
The one true light, her beauty's glowing whole.\nl
Page 275

But thought nor word can seize eternal Truth:\nl
The whole world lives in a lonely ray of her sun.\nl
In our thinking's close and narrow lamp-lit house\nl
The vanity of our shut mortal mind\nl
Dreams that the chains of thought have made her ours;\nl
But only we play with our own brilliant bonds;\nl
Tying her down, it is ourselves we tie.\nl
In our hypnosis by one luminous point\nl
We see not what small figure of her we hold;\nl
We feel not her inspiring boundlessness,\nl
We share not her immortal liberty.\nl
Thus is it even with the seer and sage;\nl
For still the human limits the divine:\nl
Out of our thoughts we must leap up to sight,\nl
Breathe her divine illimitable air,\nl
Her simple vast supremacy confess,\nl
Dare to surrender to her absolute.\nl
Then the Unmanifest reflects his form\nl
In the still mind as in a living glass;\nl
The timeless Ray descends into our hearts\nl
And we are rapt into eternity.\nl
For Truth is wider, greater than her forms.\nl
A thousand icons they have made of her\nl
And find her in the idols they adore;\nl
But she remains herself and infinite.\nl

\ht Canto Twelve: The Heavens of the Ideal
\par
\sbigcap Always the Ideal beckoned from afar.\nl
Awakened by the touch of the Unseen,\nl
Deserting the boundary of things achieved,\nl
Aspired the strong discoverer, tireless Thought,\nl
Revealing at each step a luminous world.\nl
It left known summits for the unknown peaks:\nl
Impassioned, it sought the lone unrealised Truth,\nl
It longed for the Light that knows not death and birth.\nl
Each stage of the soul's remote ascent was built\nl
Into a constant heaven felt always here.\nl
At each pace of the journey marvellous\nl
A new degree of wonder and of bliss,\nl
A new rung formed in Being's mighty stair,\nl
A great wide step trembling with jewelled fire\nl
As if a burning spirit quivered there\nl
Upholding with his flame the immortal hope,\nl
As if a radiant God had given his soul\nl
That he might feel the tread of pilgrim feet\nl
Mounting in haste to the Eternal's house.\nl
At either end of each effulgent stair\nl
The heavens of the ideal Mind were seen\nl
In a blue lucency of dreaming Space\nl
Like strips of brilliant sky clinging to the moon.\nl
On one side glimmered hue on floating hue,\nl
A glory of sunrise breaking on the soul,\nl
In a tremulous rapture of the heart's insight\nl
And the spontaneous bliss that beauty gives,\nl
The lovely kingdoms of the deathless Rose.\nl
Above the spirit cased in mortal sense\nl
Are superconscious realms of heavenly peace,\nl
Below, the Inconscient's sullen dim abyss,\nl
Page 277

Between, behind our life, the deathless Rose.\nl
Across the covert air the spirit breathes,\nl
A body of the cosmic beauty and joy\nl
Unseen, unguessed by the blind suffering world,\nl
Climbing from Nature's deep surrendered heart\nl
It blooms for ever at the feet of God,\nl
Fed by life's sacrificial mysteries.\nl
Here too its bud is born in human breasts;\nl
Then by a touch, a presence or a voice\nl
The world is turned into a temple ground\nl
And all discloses the unknown Beloved.\nl
In an outburst of heavenly joy and ease\nl
Life yields to the divinity within\nl
And gives the rapture-offering of its all,\nl
And the soul opens to felicity.\nl
A bliss is felt that never can wholly cease,\nl
A sudden mystery of secret Grace\nl
Flowers goldening our earth of red desire.\nl
All the high gods who hid their visages\nl
From the soiled passionate ritual of our hopes,\nl
Reveal their names and their undying powers.\nl
A fiery stillness wakes the slumbering cells,\nl
A passion of the flesh becoming spirit,\nl
And marvellously is fulfilled at last\nl
The miracle for which our life was made.\nl
A flame in a white voiceless cupola\nl
Is seen and faces of immortal light,\nl
The radiant limbs that know not birth and death,\nl
The breasts that suckle the first-born of the Sun,\nl
The wings that crowd thought's ardent silences,\nl
The eyes that look into spiritual Space.\nl
Our hidden centres of celestial force\nl
Open like flowers to a heavenly atmosphere;\nl
Mind pauses thrilled with the supernal Ray,\nl
And even this transient body then can feel\nl
Ideal love and flawless happiness\nl
Page 278

And laughter of the heart's sweetness and delight\nl
Freed from the rude and tragic hold of Time,\nl
And beauty and the rhythmic feet of the hours.\nl
This in high realms touches immortal kind;\nl
What here is in the bud has blossomed there.\nl
There is the secrecy of the House of Flame,\nl
The blaze of godlike thought and golden bliss,\nl
The rapt idealism of heavenly sense;\nl
There are the wonderful voices, the sun-laugh,\nl
A gurgling eddy in rivers of God's joy,\nl
And the mysteried vineyards of the gold moon-wine,\nl
All the fire and sweetness of which hardly here\nl
A brilliant shadow visits mortal life.\nl
Although are witnessed there the joys of Time,\nl
Pressed on the bosom the Immortal's touch is felt,\nl
Heard are the flutings of the Infinite.\nl
Here upon earth are early awakenings,\nl
Moments that tremble in an air divine,\nl
And grown upon the yearning of her soil\nl
Time's sun-flowers' gaze at gold Eternity:\nl
There are the imperishable beatitudes.\nl
A million lotuses swaying on one stem,\nl
World after coloured and ecstatic world\nl
Climbs towards some far unseen epiphany.\nl
\sparn On the other side of the eternal stairs\nl
The mighty kingdoms of the deathless Flame\nl
Aspired to reach the Being's absolutes.\nl
Out of the sorrow and darkness of the world,\nl
Out of the depths where life and thought are tombed,\nl
Lonely mounts up to heaven the deathless Flame.\nl
In a veiled Nature's hallowed secrecies\nl
It burns for ever on the altar Mind,\nl
Its priests the souls of dedicated gods,\nl
Humanity its house of sacrifice.\nl
Once kindled, never can its flamings cease.\nl
A fire along the mystic paths of earth,\nl
Page 279

It rises through the mortal's hemisphere,\nl
Till borne by runners of the Day and Dusk\nl
It enters the occult eternal Light\nl
And clambers whitening to the invisible Throne.\nl
Its worlds are steps of an ascending Force:\nl
A dream of giant contours, titan lines,\nl
Homes of unfallen and illumined Might,\nl
Heavens of unchanging Good pure and unborn,\nl
Heights of the grandeur of Truth's ageless ray,\nl
As in a symbol sky they start to view\nl
And call our souls into a vaster air.\nl
On their summits they bear up the sleepless Flame;\nl
Dreaming of a mysterious Beyond,\nl
Transcendent of the paths of Fate and Time,\nl
They point above themselves with index peaks\nl
Through a pale-sapphire ether of god-mind\nl
Towards some gold Infinite's apocalypse.\nl
A thunder rolling mid the hills of God,\nl
Tireless, severe is their tremendous Voice:\nl
Exceeding us, to exceed ourselves they call\nl
And bid us rise incessantly above.\nl
Far from our eager reach those summits live,\nl
Too lofty for our mortal strength and height,\nl
Hardly in a dire ecstasy of toil\nl
Climbed by the spirit's naked athlete will.\nl
Austere, intolerant they claim from us\nl
Efforts too lasting for our mortal nerve\nl
Our hearts cannot cleave to nor our flesh support;\nl
Only the Eternal's strength in us can dare\nl
To attempt the immense adventure of that climb\nl
And the sacrifice of all we cherish here.\nl
Our human knowledge is a candle burnt\nl
On a dim altar to a sun-vast Truth;\nl
Man's virtue, a coarse-spun ill-fitting dress,\nl
Apparels wooden images of Good;\nl
Passionate and blinded, bleeding, stained with mire\nl
Page 280

His energy stumbles towards a deathless Force.\nl
An imperfection dogs our highest strength;\nl
Portions and pale reflections are our share.\nl
Happy the worlds that have not felt our fall,\nl
Where Will is one with Truth and Good with Power;\nl
Impoverished not by earth-mind's indigence,\nl
They keep God's natural breath of mightiness,\nl
His bare spontaneous swift intensities;\nl
There is his great transparent mirror, Self,\nl
And there his sovereign autarchy of bliss\nl
In which immortal natures have their part,\nl
Heirs and cosharers of divinity.\nl
\sparn He through the Ideal's kingdoms moved at will,\nl
Accepted their beauty and their greatness bore,\nl
Partook of the glories of their wonder fields,\nl
But passed nor stayed beneath their splendour's rule.\nl
All there was an intense but partial light.\nl
In each a seraph-winged high-browed Idea\nl
United all knowledge by one master thought,\nl
Persuaded all action to one golden sense,\nl
All powers subjected to a single power\nl
And made a world where it could reign alone,\nl
An absolute ideal's perfect home.\nl
Insignia of their victory and their faith,\nl
They offered to the Traveller at their gates\nl
A quenchless flame or an unfading flower,\nl
Emblem of a high kingdom's privilege.\nl
A glorious shining Angel of the Way\nl
Presented to the seeking of the soul\nl
The sweetness and the might of an idea,\nl
Each deemed Truth's intimate fount and summit force,\nl
The heart of the meaning of the universe,\nl
Perfection's key, passport to Paradise.\nl
Yet were there regions where these absolutes met\nl
And made a circle of bliss with married hands;\nl
Light stood embraced by light, fire wedded fire,\nl
Page 281

But none in the other would his body lose\nl
To find his soul in the world's single Soul,\nl
A multiplied rapture of infinity.\nl
Onward he passed to a diviner sphere:\nl
There, joined in a common greatness, light and bliss,\nl
All high and beautiful and desirable powers\nl
Forgetting their difference and their separate reign\nl
Become a single multitudinous whole.\nl
Above the parting of the roads of Time,\nl
Above the Silence and its thousandfold Word,\nl
In the immutable and inviolate Truth\nl
For ever united and inseparable,\nl
The radiant children of Eternity dwell\nl
On the wide spirit height where all are one.\nl

\sbigcap At last there came a bare indifferent sky\nl
Where Silence listened to the cosmic Voice,\nl
But answered nothing to a million calls;\nl
The soul's endless question met with no response.\nl
An abrupt conclusion ended eager hopes,\nl
A deep cessation in a mighty calm,\nl
A finis-line on the last page of thought\nl
And a margin and a blank of wordless peace.\nl
There paused the climbing hierarchy of worlds.\nl
He stood on a wide arc of summit Space\nl
Alone with an enormous Self of Mind\nl
Which held all life in a corner of its vasts.\nl
Omnipotent, immobile and aloof,\nl
In the world which sprang from it, it took no part:\nl
It gave no heed to the paeans of victory,\nl
It was indifferent to its own defeats,\nl
It heard the cry of grief and made no sign;\nl
Impartial fell its gaze on evil and good,\nl
It saw destruction come and did not move.\nl
An equal Cause of things, a lonely Seer\nl
And Master of its multitude of forms,\nl
It acted not but bore all thoughts and deeds,\nl
The witness Lord of Nature's myriad acts\nl
Consenting to the movements of her Force.\nl
His mind reflected this vast quietism.\nl
This witness hush is the Thinker's secret base:\nl
Hidden in silent depths the word is formed,\nl
From hidden silences the act is born\nl
Into the voiceful mind, the labouring world;\nl
In secrecy wraps the seed the Eternal sows\nl
Silence, the mystic birthplace of the soul.\nl
Page 283

In God's supreme withdrawn and timeless hush\nl
A seeing Self and potent Energy met;\nl
The Silence knew itself and thought took form:\nl
Self-made from the dual power creation rose.\nl
In the still self he lived and it in him;\nl
Its mute immemorable listening depths,\nl
Its vastness and its stillness were his own;\nl
One being with it he grew wide, powerful, free.\nl
Apart, unbound, he looked on all things done.\nl
As one who builds his own imagined scenes\nl
And loses not himself in what he sees,\nl
Spectator of a drama self-conceived,\nl
He looked on the world and watched its motive thoughts\nl
With the burden of luminous prophecy in their eyes,\nl
Its forces with their feet of wind and fire\nl
Arisen from the dumbness in his soul.\nl
All now he seemed to understand and know;\nl
Desire came not nor any gust of will,\nl
The great perturbed inquirer lost his task;\nl
Nothing was asked nor wanted any more.\nl
There he could stay, the Self, the Silence won:\nl
His soul had peace, it knew the cosmic Whole.\nl
Then suddenly a luminous finger fell\nl
On all things seen or touched or heard or felt\nl
And showed his mind that nothing could be known;\nl
That must be reached from which all knowledge comes.\nl
The sceptic Ray disrupted all that seems\nl
And smote at the very roots of thought and sense.\nl
In a universe of Nescience they have grown,\nl
Aspiring towards a superconscient Sun,\nl
Playing in shine and rain from heavenlier skies\nl
They never can win however high their reach\nl
Or overpass however keen their probe.\nl
A doubt corroded even the means to think,\nl
Distrust was thrown upon Mind's instruments;\nl
All that it takes for reality's shining coin,\nl
Page 284

Proved fact, fixed inference, deduction clear,\nl
Firm theory, assured significance,\nl
Appeared as frauds upon Time's credit bank\nl
Or assets valueless in Truth's treasury.\nl
An Ignorance on an uneasy throne\nl
Travestied with a fortuitous sovereignty\nl
A figure of knowledge garbed in dubious words\nl
And tinsel thought-forms brightly inadequate.\nl
A labourer in the dark dazzled by half-light,\nl
What it knew was an image in a broken glass,\nl
What it saw was real but its sight untrue.\nl
All the ideas in its vast repertory\nl
Were like the mutterings of a transient cloud\nl
That spent itself in sound and left no trace.\nl
A frail house hanging in uncertain air,\nl
The thin ingenious web round which it moves,\nl
Put out awhile on the tree of the universe,\nl
And gathered up into itself again,\nl
Was only a trap to catch life's insect food,\nl
Winged thoughts that flutter fragile in brief light\nl
But dead, once captured in fixed forms of mind,\nl
Aims puny but looming large in man's small scale,\nl
Flickers of imagination's brilliant gauze\nl
And cobweb-wrapped beliefs alive no more.\nl
The magic hut of built-up certitudes\nl
Made out of glittering dust and bright moonshine\nl
In which it shrines its image of the Real,\nl
Collapsed into the Nescience whence it rose.\nl
Only a gleam was there of symbol facts\nl
That shroud the mystery lurking in their glow,\nl
And falsehoods based on hidden realities\nl
By which they live until they fall from Time.\nl
Our mind is a house haunted by the slain past,\nl
Ideas soon mummified, ghosts of old truths,\nl
God's spontaneities tied with formal strings\nl
And packed into drawers of reason's trim bureau,\nl
Page 285

A grave of great lost opportunities,\nl
Or an office for misuse of soul and life\nl
And all the waste man makes of heaven's gifts\nl
And all his squanderings of Nature's store,\nl
A stage for the comedy of Ignorance.\nl
The world seemed a long aeonic failure's scene:\nl
All sterile grew, no base was left secure.\nl
Assailed by the edge of the convicting beam\nl
The builder Reason lost her confidence\nl
In the successful sleight and turn of thought\nl
That makes the soul the prisoner of a phrase.\nl
Its highest wisdom was a brilliant guess,\nl
Its mighty structured science of the worlds\nl
A passing light on being's surfaces.\nl
There was nothing there but a schema drawn by sense,\nl
A substitute for eternal mysteries,\nl
A scrawl figure of reality, a plan\nl
And elevation by the architect Word\nl
Imposed upon the semblances of Time.\nl
Existence' self was shadowed by a doubt;\nl
Almost it seemed a lotus-leaf afloat\nl
On a nude pool of cosmic Nothingness.\nl
This great spectator and creator Mind\nl
Was only some half-seeing's delegate,\nl
A veil that hung between the soul and Light,\nl
An idol, not the living body of God.\nl
Even the still spirit that looks upon its works\nl
Was some pale front of the Unknowable;\nl
A shadow seemed the wide and witness Self,\nl
Its liberation and immobile calm\nl
A void recoil of being from Time-made things,\nl
Not the self-vision of Eternity.\nl
Deep peace was there, but not the nameless Force:\nl
Our sweet and mighty Mother was not there\nl
Who gathers to her bosom her children's lives,\nl
Her clasp that takes the world into her arms\nl
Page 286

In the fathomless rapture of the Infinite,\nl
The Bliss that is creation's splendid grain\nl
Or the white passion of God-ecstasy\nl
That laughs in the blaze of the boundless heart of Love.\nl
A greater Spirit than the Self of Mind\nl
Must answer to the questioning of his soul.\nl
For here was no firm clue and no sure road;\nl
High-climbing pathways ceased in the unknown;\nl
An artist Sight constructed the Beyond\nl
In contrary patterns and conflicting hues;\nl
A part-experience fragmented the Whole.\nl
He looked above, but all was blank and still:\nl
A sapphire firmament of abstract Thought\nl
Escaped into a formless Vacancy.\nl
He looked below, but all was dark and mute.\nl
A noise was heard, between, of thought and prayer,\nl
A strife, a labour without end or pause;\nl
A vain and ignorant seeking raised its voice.\nl
A rumour and a movement and a call,\nl
A foaming mass, a cry innumerable\nl
Rolled ever upon the ocean surge of Life\nl
Along the coasts of mortal Ignorance.\nl
On its unstable and enormous breast\nl
Beings and forces, forms, ideas like waves\nl
Jostled for figure and supremacy,\nl
And rose and sank and rose again in Time;\nl
And at the bottom of the sleepless stir,\nl
A Nothingness parent of the struggling worlds,\nl
A huge creator Death, a mystic Void,\nl
For ever sustaining the irrational cry,\nl
For ever excluding the supernal Word,\nl
Motionless, refusing question and response,\nl
Reposed beneath the voices and the march\nl
The dim Inconscient's dumb incertitude.\nl
Two firmaments of darkness and of light\nl
Opposed their limits to the spirit's walk;\nl
Page 287

It moved veiled in from Self's infinity\nl
In a world of beings and momentary events\nl
Where all must die to live and live to die.\nl
Immortal by renewed mortality,\nl
It wandered in the spiral of its acts\nl
Or ran around the cycles of its thought,\nl
Yet was no more than its original self\nl
And knew no more than when it first began.\nl
To be was a prison, extinction the escape.\nl

\sbigcap A covert answer to his seeking came.\nl
In a far shimmering background of Mind-Space\nl
A glowing mouth was seen, a luminous shaft;\nl
A recluse gate it seemed, musing on joy,\nl
A veiled retreat and escape to mystery.\nl
Away from the unsatisfied surface world\nl
It fled into the bosom of the unknown,\nl
A well, a tunnel of the depths of God.\nl
It plunged as if a mystic groove of hope\nl
Through many layers of formless voiceless self\nl
To reach the last profound of the world's heart,\nl
And from that heart there surged a wordless call\nl
Pleading with some still impenetrable Mind,\nl
Voicing some passionate unseen desire.\nl
As if a beckoning finger of secrecy\nl
Outstretched into a crystal mood of air,\nl
Pointing at him from some near hidden depth,\nl
As if a message from the world's deep soul,\nl
An intimation of a lurking joy\nl
That flowed out from a cup of brooding bliss,\nl
There shimmered stealing out into the Mind\nl
A mute and quivering ecstasy of light,\nl
A passion and delicacy of roseate fire.\nl
As one drawn to his lost spiritual home\nl
Feels now the closeness of a waiting love,\nl
Into a passage dim and tremulous\nl
That clasped him in from day and night's pursuit,\nl
He travelled led by a mysterious sound.\nl
A murmur multitudinous and lone,\nl
All sounds it was in turn, yet still the same.\nl
A hidden call to unforeseen delight\nl
Page 289

In the summoning voice of one long-known, well-loved,\nl
But nameless to the unremembering mind,\nl
It led to rapture back the truant heart.\nl
The immortal cry ravished the captive ear.\nl
Then, lowering its imperious mystery,\nl
It sank to a whisper circling round the soul.\nl
It seemed the yearning of a lonely flute\nl
That roamed along the shores of memory\nl
And filled the eyes with tears of longing joy.\nl
A cricket's rash and fiery single note,\nl
It marked with shrill melody night's moonless hush\nl
And beat upon a nerve of mystic sleep\nl
Its high insistent magical reveille.\nl
A jingling silver laugh of anklet bells\nl
Travelled the roads of a solitary heart;\nl
Its dance solaced an eternal loneliness:\nl
An old forgotten sweetness sobbing came.\nl
Or from a far harmonious distance heard\nl
The tinkling pace of a long caravan\nl
It seemed at times, or a vast forest's hymn,\nl
The solemn reminder of a temple gong,\nl
A bee-croon honey-drunk in summer isles\nl
Ardent with ecstasy in a slumbrous noon,\nl
Or the far anthem of a pilgrim sea.\nl
An incense floated in the quivering air,\nl
A mystic happiness trembled in the breast\nl
As if the invisible Beloved had come\nl
Assuming the sudden loveliness of a face\nl
And close glad hands could seize his fugitive feet\nl
And the world change with the beauty of a smile.\nl
Into a wonderful bodiless realm he came,\nl
The home of a passion without name or voice,\nl
A depth he felt answering to every height,\nl
A nook was found that could embrace all worlds,\nl
A point that was the conscious knot of Space,\nl
An hour eternal in the heart of Time.\nl
Page 290

The silent Soul of all the world was there:\nl
A Being lived, a Presence and a Power,\nl
A single Person who was himself and all\nl
And cherished Nature's sweet and dangerous throbs\nl
Transfigured into beats divine and pure.\nl
One who could love without return for love,\nl
Meeting and turning to the best the worst,\nl
It healed the bitter cruelties of earth,\nl
Transforming all experience to delight;\nl
Intervening in the sorrowful paths of birth\nl
It rocked the cradle of the cosmic Child\nl
And stilled all weeping with its hand of joy;\nl
It led things evil towards their secret good,\nl
It turned racked falsehood into happy truth;\nl
Its power was to reveal divinity.\nl
Infinite, coeval with the mind of God,\nl
It bore within itself a seed, a flame,\nl
A seed from which the Eternal is new-born,\nl
A flame that cancels death in mortal things.\nl
All grew to all kindred and self and near;\nl
The intimacy of God was everywhere,\nl
No veil was felt, no brute barrier inert,\nl
Distance could not divide, Time could not change.\nl
A fire of passion burned in spirit-depths,\nl
A constant touch of sweetness linked all hearts,\nl
The throb of one adoration's single bliss\nl
In a rapt ether of undying love.\nl
An inner happiness abode in all,\nl
A sense of universal harmonies,\nl
A measureless secure eternity\nl
Of truth and beauty and good and joy made one.\nl
Here was the welling core of finite life;\nl
A formless spirit became the soul of form.\nl

\spar All there was soul or made of sheer soul-stuff;\nl
A sky of soul covered a deep soul-ground.\nl
Page 291

All here was known by a spiritual sense:\nl
Thought was not there but a knowledge near and one\nl
Seized on all things by a moved identity,\nl
A sympathy of self with other selves,\nl
The touch of consciousness on consciousness\nl
And being's look on being with inmost gaze\nl
And heart laid bare to heart without walls of speech\nl
And the unanimity of seeing minds\nl
In myriad forms luminous with the one God.\nl
Life was not there, but an impassioned force,\nl
Finer than fineness, deeper than the deeps,\nl
Felt as a subtle and spiritual power,\nl
A quivering out from soul to answering soul,\nl
A mystic movement, a close influence,\nl
A free and happy and intense approach\nl
Of being to being with no screen or check,\nl
Without which life and love could never have been.\nl
Body was not there, for bodies were needed not,\nl
The soul itself was its own deathless form\nl
And met at once the touch of other souls\nl
Close, blissful, concrete, wonderfully true.\nl
As when one walks in sleep through luminous dreams\nl
And, conscious, knows the truth their figures mean,\nl
Here where reality was its own dream,\nl
He knew things by their soul and not their shape:\nl
As those who have lived long made one in love\nl
Need word nor sign for heart's reply to heart,\nl
He met and communed without bar of speech\nl
With beings unveiled by a material frame.\nl
There was a strange spiritual scenery,\nl
A loveliness of lakes and streams and hills,\nl
A flow, a fixity in a soul-space,\nl
And plains and valleys, stretches of soul-joy,\nl
And gardens that were flower-tracts of the spirit,\nl
Its meditations of tinged reverie.\nl
Air was the breath of a pure infinite.\nl
Page 292

A fragrance wandered in a coloured haze\nl
As if the scent and hue of all sweet flowers\nl
Had mingled to copy heaven's atmosphere.\nl
Appealing to the soul and not the eye\nl
Beauty lived there at home in her own house,\nl
There all was beautiful by its own right\nl
And needed not the splendour of a robe.\nl
All objects were like bodies of the Gods,\nl
A spirit symbol environing a soul,\nl
For world and self were one reality.\nl

\spar Immersed in voiceless internatal trance\nl
The beings that once wore forms on earth sat there\nl
In shining chambers of spiritual sleep.\nl
Passed were the pillar-posts of birth and death,\nl
Passed was their little scene of symbol deeds,\nl
Passed were the heavens and hells of their long road;\nl
They had returned into the world's deep soul.\nl
All now was gathered into pregnant rest:\nl
Person and nature suffered a slumber change.\nl
In trance they gathered back their bygone selves,\nl
In a background memory's foreseeing muse\nl
Prophetic of new personality\nl
Arranged the map of their coming destiny's course:\nl
Heirs of their past, their future's discoverers,\nl
Electors of their own self-chosen lot,\nl
They waited for the adventure of new life.\nl
A Person persistent through the lapse of worlds,\nl
Although the same for ever in many shapes\nl
By the outward mind unrecognisable,\nl
Assuming names unknown in unknown climes\nl
Imprints through Time upon the earth's worn page\nl
A growing figure of its secret self,\nl
And learns by experience what the spirit knew,\nl
Till it can see its truth alive and God.\nl
Once more they must face the problem-game of birth,\nl
Page 293

The soul's experiment of joy and grief\nl
And thought and impulse lighting the blind act,\nl
And venture on the roads of circumstance,\nl
Through inner movements and external scenes\nl
Travelling to self across the forms of things.\nl
Into creation's centre he had come.\nl
The spirit wandering from state to state\nl
Finds here the silence of its starting-point\nl
In the formless force and the still fixity\nl
And brooding passion of the world of Soul.\nl
All that is made and once again unmade,\nl
The calm persistent vision of the One\nl
Inevitably re-makes, it lives anew:\nl
Forces and lives and beings and ideas\nl
Are taken into the stillness for a while;\nl
There they remould their purpose and their drift,\nl
Recast their nature and re-form their shape.\nl
Ever they change and changing ever grow,\nl
And passing through a fruitful stage of death\nl
And after long reconstituting sleep\nl
Resume their place in the process of the Gods\nl
Until their work in cosmic Time is done.\nl
\sparn Here was the fashioning chamber of the worlds.\nl
An interval was left twixt act and act,\nl
Twixt birth and birth, twixt dream and waking dream,\nl
A pause that gave new strength to do and be.\nl
Beyond were regions of delight and peace,\nl
Mute birthplaces of light and hope and love,\nl
And cradles of heavenly rapture and repose.\nl
In a slumber of the voices of the world\nl
He of the eternal moment grew aware;\nl
His knowledge stripped bare of the garbs of sense\nl
Knew by identity without thought or word;\nl
His being saw itself without its veils,\nl
Life's line fell from the spirit's infinity.\nl
Along a road of pure interior light,\nl
Page 294

Alone between tremendous Presences,\nl
Under the watching eyes of nameless Gods,\nl
His soul passed on, a single conscious power,\nl
Towards the end which ever begins again,\nl
Approaching through a stillness dumb and calm\nl
To the source of all things human and divine.\nl
There he beheld in their mighty union's poise\nl
The figure of the deathless Two-in-One,\nl
A single being in two bodies clasped,\nl
A diarchy of two united souls,\nl
Seated absorbed in deep creative joy;\nl
Their trance of bliss sustained the mobile world.\nl
Behind them in a morning dusk One stood\nl
Who brought them forth from the Unknowable.\nl
Ever disguised she awaits the seeking spirit;\nl
Watcher on the supreme unreachable peaks,\nl
Guide of the traveller of the unseen paths,\nl
She guards the austere approach to the Alone.\nl
At the beginning of each far-spread plane\nl
Pervading with her power the cosmic suns\nl
She reigns, inspirer of its multiple works\nl
And thinker of the symbol of its scene.\nl
Above them all she stands supporting all,\nl
The sole omnipotent Goddess ever-veiled\nl
Of whom the world is the inscrutable mask;\nl
The ages are the footfalls of her tread,\nl
Their happenings the figure of her thoughts,\nl
And all creation is her endless act.\nl
His spirit was made a vessel of her force;\nl
Mute in the fathomless passion of his will\nl
He outstretched to her his folded hands of prayer.\nl
Then in a sovereign answer to his heart\nl
A gesture came as of worlds thrown away,\nl
And from her raiment's lustrous mystery raised\nl
One arm half-parted the eternal veil.\nl
A light appeared still and imperishable.\nl
Page 295

Attracted to the large and luminous depths\nl
Of the ravishing enigma of her eyes,\nl
He saw the mystic outline of a face.\nl
Overwhelmed by her implacable light and bliss,\nl
An atom of her illimitable self\nl
Mastered by the honey and lightning of her power,\nl
Tossed towards the shores of her ocean-ecstasy,\nl
Drunk with a deep golden spiritual wine,\nl
He cast from the rent stillness of his soul\nl
A cry of adoration and desire\nl
And the surrender of his boundless mind\nl
And the self-giving of his silent heart.\nl
He fell down at her feet unconscious, prone.\nl

\sbigcap After a measureless moment of the soul\nl
Again returning to these surface fields\nl
Out of the timeless depths where he had sunk,\nl
He heard once more the slow tread of the hours.\nl
All once perceived and lived was far away;\nl
Himself was to himself his only scene.\nl
Above the Witness and his universe\nl
He stood in a realm of boundless silences\nl
Awaiting the Voice that spoke and built the worlds.\nl
A light was round him wide and absolute,\nl
A diamond purity of eternal sight;\nl
A consciousness lay still, devoid of forms,\nl
Free, wordless, uncoerced by sign or rule,\nl
For ever content with only being and bliss;\nl
A sheer existence lived in its own peace\nl
On the single spirit's bare and infinite ground.\nl
Out of the sphere of Mind he had arisen,\nl
He had left the reign of Nature's hues and shades;\nl
He dwelt in his self's colourless purity.\nl
It was a plane of undetermined spirit\nl
That could be a zero or round sum of things,\nl
A state in which all ceased and all began.\nl
All it became that figures the absolute,\nl
A high vast peak whence Spirit could see the worlds,\nl
Calm's wide epiphany, wisdom's mute home,\nl
A lonely station of Omniscience,\nl
A diving-board of the Eternal's power,\nl
A white floor in the house of All-Delight.\nl
Here came the thought that passes beyond Thought,\nl
Here the still Voice which our listening cannot hear,\nl
The Knowledge by which the knower is the known,\nl
Page 297

The Love in which beloved and lover are one.\nl
All stood in an original plenitude,\nl
Hushed and fulfilled before they could create\nl
The glorious dream of their universal acts;\nl
Here was engendered the spiritual birth,\nl
Here closed the finite's crawl to the Infinite.\nl
A thousand roads leaped into Eternity\nl
Or singing ran to meet God's veilless face.\nl
The Known released him from its limiting chain;\nl
He knocked at the doors of the Unknowable.\nl
Thence gazing with an immeasurable outlook\nl
One with self's inlook into its own pure vasts,\nl
He saw the splendour of the spirit's realms,\nl
The greatness and wonder of its boundless works,\nl
The power and passion leaping from its calm,\nl
The rapture of its movement and its rest,\nl
And its fire-sweet miracle of transcendent life,\nl
The million-pointing undivided grasp\nl
Of its vision of one same stupendous All,\nl
Its inexhaustible acts in a timeless Time,\nl
A space that is its own infinity.\nl
A glorious multiple of one radiant Self,\nl
Answering to joy with joy, to love with love,\nl
All there were moving mansions of God-bliss;\nl
Eternal and unique they lived the One.\nl
There forces are great outbursts of God's truth\nl
And objects are its pure spiritual shapes;\nl
Spirit no more is hid from its own view,\nl
All sentience is a sea of happiness\nl
And all creation is an act of light.\nl
Out of the neutral silence of his soul\nl
He passed to its fields of puissance and of calm\nl
And saw the Powers that stand above the world,\nl
Traversed the realms of the supreme Idea\nl
And sought the summit of created things\nl
And the almighty source of cosmic change.\nl

There Knowledge called him to her mystic peaks\nl
Where thought is held in a vast internal sense\nl
And feeling swims across a sea of peace\nl
And vision climbs beyond the reach of Time.\nl
An equal of the first creator seers,\nl
Accompanied by an all-revealing light\nl
He moved through regions of transcendent Truth\nl
Inward, immense, innumerably one.\nl
There distance was his own huge spirit's extent;\nl
Delivered from the fictions of the mind\nl
Time's triple dividing step baffled no more;\nl
Its inevitable and continuous stream,\nl
The long flow of its manifesting course,\nl
Was held in spirit's single wide regard.\nl
A universal beauty showed its face:\nl
The invisible deep-fraught significances,\nl
Here sheltered behind form's insensible screen,\nl
Uncovered to him their deathless harmony\nl
And the key to the wonder-book of common things.\nl
In their uniting law stood up revealed\nl
The multiple measures of the upbuilding force,\nl
The lines of the World-Geometer's technique,\nl
The enchantments that uphold the cosmic web\nl
And the magic underlying simple shapes.\nl
On peaks where Silence listens with still heart\nl
To the rhythmic metres of the rolling worlds,\nl
He served the sessions of the triple Fire.\nl
On the rim of two continents of slumber and trance\nl
He heard the ever unspoken Reality's voice\nl
Awaken revelation's mystic cry,\nl
The birthplace found of the sudden infallible Word\nl
And lived in the rays of an intuitive Sun.\nl
Absolved from the ligaments of death and sleep\nl
He rode the lightning seas of cosmic Mind\nl
And crossed the ocean of original sound;\nl
On the last step to the supernal birth\nl
Page 299

He trod along extinction's narrow edge\nl
Near the high verges of eternity,\nl
And mounted the gold ridge of the world-dream\nl
Between the slayer and the saviour fires;\nl
The belt he reached of the unchanging Truth,\nl
Met borders of the inexpressible Light\nl
And thrilled with the presence of the Ineffable.\nl
Above him he saw the flaming Hierarchies,\nl
The wings that fold around created Space,\nl
The sun-eyed Guardians and the golden Sphinx\nl
And the tiered planes and the immutable Lords.\nl
A wisdom waiting on Omniscience\nl
Sat voiceless in a vast passivity;\nl
It judged not, measured not, nor strove to know,\nl
But listened for the veiled all-seeing Thought\nl
And the burden of a calm transcendent Voice.\nl
He had reached the top of all that can be known:\nl
His sight surpassed creation's head and base;\nl
Ablaze the triple heavens revealed their suns,\nl
The obscure Abyss exposed its monstrous rule.\nl
All but the ultimate Mystery was his field,\nl
Almost the Unknowable disclosed its rim.\nl
His self's infinities began to emerge,\nl
The hidden universes cried to him;\nl
Eternities called to eternities\nl
Sending their speechless message still remote.\nl
Arisen from the marvel of the depths\nl
And burning from the superconscious heights\nl
And sweeping in great horizontal gyres\nl
A million energies joined and were the One.\nl
All flowed immeasurably to one sea:\nl
All living forms became its atom homes.\nl
A Panergy that harmonised all life\nl
Held now existence in its vast control;\nl
A portion of that majesty he was made.\nl
At will he lived in the unoblivious Ray.\nl
Page 300

\sparn In that high realm where no untruth can come,\nl
Where all are different and all is one,\nl
In the Impersonal's ocean without shore\nl
The Person in the World-Spirit anchored rode;\nl
It thrilled with the mighty marchings of World-Force,\nl
Its acts were the comrades of God's infinite peace.\nl
An adjunct glory and a symbol self,\nl
The body was delivered to the soul,—\nl
An immortal point of power, a block of poise\nl
In a cosmicity's wide formless surge,\nl
A conscious edge of the Transcendent's might\nl
Carving perfection from a bright world-stuff,\nl
It figured in it a universe's sense.\nl
There consciousness was a close and single weft;\nl
The far and near were one in spirit-space,\nl
The moments there were pregnant with all time.\nl
The superconscient's screen was ripped by thought,\nl
Idea rotated symphonies of sight,\nl
Sight was a flame-throw from identity;\nl
Life was a marvellous journey of the spirit,\nl
Feeling a wave from the universal Bliss.\nl
In the kingdom of the Spirit's power and light,\nl
As if one who arrived out of infinity's womb\nl
He came new-born, infant and limitless\nl
And grew in the wisdom of the timeless Child;\nl
He was a vast that soon became a Sun.\nl
A great luminous silence whispered to his heart;\nl
His knowledge an inview caught unfathomable,\nl
An outview by no brief horizons cut:\nl
He thought and felt in all, his gaze had power.\nl
He communed with the Incommunicable;\nl
Beings of a wider consciousness were his friends,\nl
Forms of a larger subtler make drew near;\nl
The Gods conversed with him behind Life's veil.\nl
Neighbour his being grew to Nature's crests.\nl
The primal Energy took him in its arms;\nl
Page 301

His brain was wrapped in overwhelming light,\nl
An all-embracing knowledge seized his heart:\nl
Thoughts rose in him no earthly mind can hold,\nl
Mights played that never coursed through mortal nerves:\nl
He scanned the secrets of the Overmind,\nl
He bore the rapture of the Oversoul.\nl
A borderer of the empire of the Sun,\nl
Attuned to the supernal harmonies,\nl
He linked creation to the Eternal's sphere.\nl
His finite parts approached their absolutes,\nl
His actions framed the movements of the Gods,\nl
His will took up the reins of cosmic Force.\nl

\par
\sbigcap All is too little that the world can give:\nl
Its power and knowledge are the gifts of Time\nl
And cannot fill the spirit's sacred thirst.\nl
Although of One these forms of greatness are\nl
And by its breath of grace our lives abide,\nl
Although more near to us than nearness' self,\nl
It is some utter truth of what we are;\nl
Hidden by its own works, it seemed far-off,\nl
Impenetrable, occult, voiceless, obscure.\nl
The Presence was lost by which all things have charm,\nl
The Glory lacked of which they are dim signs.\nl
The world lived on made empty of its Cause,\nl
Like love when the beloved's face is gone.\nl
The labour to know seemed a vain strife of Mind;\nl
All knowledge ended in the Unknowable:\nl
The effort to rule seemed a vain pride of Will;\nl
A trivial achievement scorned by Time,\nl
All power retired into the Omnipotent.\nl
A cave of darkness guards the eternal Light.\nl
A silence settled on his striving heart;\nl
Absolved from the voices of the world's desire,\nl
He turned to the Ineffable's timeless call.\nl
A Being intimate and unnameable,\nl
A wide compelling ecstasy and peace\nl
Felt in himself and all and yet ungrasped,\nl
Approached and faded from his soul's pursuit\nl
As if for ever luring him beyond.\nl
Near, it retreated; far, it called him still.\nl
Nothing could satisfy but its delight:\nl
Its absence left the greatest actions dull,\nl
Its presence made the smallest seem divine.\nl
Page 305

When it was there, the heart's abyss was filled;\nl
But when the uplifting Deity withdrew,\nl
Existence lost its aim in the Inane.\nl
The order of the immemorial planes,\nl
The godlike fullness of the instruments\nl
Were turned to props for an impermanent scene.\nl
But who that mightiness was he knew not yet.\nl
Impalpable, yet filling all that is,\nl
It made and blotted out a million worlds\nl
And took and lost a thousand shapes and names.\nl
It wore the guise of an indiscernible Vast,\nl
Or was a subtle kernel in the soul:\nl
A distant greatness left it huge and dim,\nl
A mystic closeness shut it sweetly in:\nl
It seemed sometimes a figment or a robe\nl
And seemed sometimes his own colossal shade.\nl
A giant doubt overshadowed his advance.\nl
Across a neutral all-supporting Void\nl
Whose blankness nursed his lone immortal spirit,\nl
Allured towards some recondite Supreme,\nl
Aided, coerced by enigmatic Powers,\nl
Aspiring and half-sinking and upborne,\nl
Invincibly he ascended without pause.\nl
Always a signless vague Immensity\nl
Brooded, without approach, beyond response,\nl
Condemning finite things to nothingness,\nl
Fronting him with the incommensurable.\nl
Then to the ascent there came a mighty term.\nl
A height was reached where nothing made could live,\nl
A line where every hope and search must cease\nl
Neared some intolerant bare Reality,\nl
A zero formed pregnant with boundless change.\nl
On a dizzy verge where all disguises fail\nl
And human mind must abdicate in Light\nl
Or die like a moth in the naked blaze of Truth,\nl
He stood compelled to a tremendous choice.\nl
Page 306

All he had been and all towards which he grew\nl
Must now be left behind or else transform\nl
Into a self of That which has no name.\nl
Alone and fronting an intangible Force\nl
Which offered nothing to the grasp of Thought,\nl
His spirit faced the adventure of the Inane.\nl
Abandoned by the worlds of Form he strove.\nl
A fruitful world-wide Ignorance foundered here;\nl
Thought's long far-circling journey touched its close\nl
And ineffective paused the actor Will.\nl
The symbol modes of being helped no more,\nl
The structures Nescience builds collapsing failed,\nl
And even the spirit that holds the universe\nl
Fainted in luminous insufficiency.\nl
In an abysmal lapse of all things built\nl
Transcending every perishable support\nl
And joining at last its mighty origin,\nl
The separate self must melt or be reborn\nl
Into a Truth beyond the mind's appeal.\nl
All glory of outline, sweetness of harmony,\nl
Rejected like a grace of trivial notes,\nl
Expunged from Being's silence nude, austere,\nl
Died into a fine and blissful Nothingness.\nl
The Demiurges lost their names and forms,\nl
The great schemed worlds that they had planned and wrought\nl
Passed, taken and abolished one by one.\nl
The universe removed its coloured veil,\nl
And at the unimaginable end\nl
Of the huge riddle of created things\nl
Appeared the far-seen Godhead of the whole,\nl
His feet firm-based on Life's stupendous wings,\nl
Omnipotent, a lonely seer of Time,\nl
Inward, inscrutable, with diamond gaze.\nl
Attracted by the unfathomable regard\nl
The unsolved slow cycles to their fount returned\nl
To rise again from that invisible sea.\nl
Page 307

All from his puissance born was now undone;\nl
Nothing remained the cosmic Mind conceives.\nl
Eternity prepared to fade and seemed\nl
A hue and imposition on the Void,\nl
Space was the fluttering of a dream that sank\nl
Before its ending into Nothing's deeps.\nl
The spirit that dies not and the Godhead's self\nl
Seemed myths projected from the Unknowable;\nl
From It all sprang, in It is called to cease.\nl
But what That was, no thought nor sight could tell.\nl
Only a formless Form of self was left,\nl
A tenuous ghost of something that had been,\nl
The last experience of a lapsing wave\nl
Before it sinks into a bourneless sea,—\nl
As if it kept even on the brink of Nought\nl
Its bare feeling of the ocean whence it came.\nl
A Vastness brooded free from sense of Space,\nl
An Everlastingness cut off from Time;\nl
A strange sublime inalterable Peace\nl
Silent rejected from it world and soul.\nl
A stark companionless Reality\nl
Answered at last to his soul's passionate search:\nl
Passionless, wordless, absorbed in its fathomless hush,\nl
Keeping the mystery none would ever pierce,\nl
It brooded inscrutable and intangible\nl
Facing him with its dumb tremendous calm.\nl
It had no kinship with the universe:\nl
There was no act, no movement in its Vast:\nl
Life's question met by its silence died on her lips,\nl
The world's effort ceased convicted of ignorance\nl
Finding no sanction of supernal Light:\nl
There was no mind there with its need to know,\nl
There was no heart there with its need to love.\nl
All person perished in its namelessness.\nl
There was no second, it had no partner or peer;\nl
Only itself was real to itself.\nl
Page 308

A pure existence safe from thought and mood,\nl
A consciousness of unshared immortal bliss,\nl
It dwelt aloof in its bare infinite,\nl
One and unique, unutterably sole.\nl
A Being formless, featureless and mute\nl
That knew itself by its own timeless self,\nl
Aware for ever in its motionless depths,\nl
Uncreating, uncreated and unborn,\nl
The One by whom all live, who lives by none,\nl
An immeasurable luminous secrecy\nl
Guarded by the veils of the Unmanifest,\nl
Above the changing cosmic interlude\nl
Abode supreme, immutably the same,\nl
A silent Cause occult, impenetrable,—\nl
Infinite, eternal, unthinkable, alone.\nl

\sbigcap A stillness absolute, incommunicable,\nl
Meets the sheer self-discovery of the soul;\nl
A wall of stillness shuts it from the world,\nl
A gulf of stillness swallows up the sense\nl
And makes unreal all that mind has known,\nl
All that the labouring senses still would weave\nl
Prolonging an imaged unreality.\nl
Self's vast spiritual silence occupies Space;\nl
Only the Inconceivable is left,\nl
Only the Nameless without space and time:\nl
Abolished is the burdening need of life:\nl
Thought falls from us, we cease from joy and grief;\nl
The ego is dead; we are freed from being and care,\nl
We have done with birth and death and work and fate.\nl
O soul, it is too early to rejoice!\nl
Thou hast reached the boundless silence of the Self,\nl
Thou hast leaped into a glad divine abyss;\nl
But where hast thou thrown Self's mission and Self's power?\nl
On what dead bank on the Eternal's road?\nl
One was within thee who was self and world,\nl
What hast thou done for his purpose in the stars?\nl
Escape brings not the victory and the crown!\nl
Something thou cam'st to do from the Unknown,\nl
But nothing is finished and the world goes on\nl
Because only half God's cosmic work is done.\nl
Only the everlasting No has neared\nl
And stared into thy eyes and killed thy heart:\nl
But where is the Lover's everlasting Yes,\nl
And immortality in the secret heart,\nl
The voice that chants to the creator Fire,\nl
The symbolled OM, the great assenting Word,\nl
Page 310

The bridge between the rapture and the calm,\nl
The passion and the beauty of the Bride,\nl
The chamber where the glorious enemies kiss,\nl
The smile that saves, the golden peak of things?\nl
This too is Truth at the mystic fount of Life.\nl
A black veil has been lifted; we have seen\nl
The mighty shadow of the omniscient Lord;\nl
But who has lifted up the veil of light\nl
And who has seen the body of the King?\nl
The mystery of God's birth and acts remains\nl
Leaving unbroken the last chapter's seal,\nl
Unsolved the riddle of the unfinished Play;\nl
The cosmic Player laughs within his mask,\nl
And still the last inviolate secret hides\nl
Behind the human glory of a Form,\nl
Behind the gold eidolon of a Name.\nl
A large white line has figured as a goal,\nl
But far beyond the ineffable suntracks blaze:\nl
What seemed the source and end was a wide gate,\nl
A last bare step into eternity.\nl
An eye has opened upon timelessness,\nl
Infinity takes back the forms it gave,\nl
And through God's darkness or his naked light\nl
His million rays return into the Sun.\nl
There is a zero sign of the Supreme;\nl
Nature left nude and still uncovers God.\nl
But in her grandiose nothingness all is there:\nl
When her strong garbs are torn away from us,\nl
The soul's ignorance is slain but not the soul:\nl
The zero covers an immortal face.\nl
A high and blank negation is not all,\nl
A huge extinction is not God's last word,\nl
Life's ultimate sense, the close of being's course,\nl
The meaning of this great mysterious world.\nl
In absolute silence sleeps an absolute Power.\nl
Awaking, it can wake the trance-bound soul\nl
Page 311

And in the ray reveal the parent sun:\nl
It can make the world a vessel of Spirit's force,\nl
It can fashion in the clay God's perfect shape.\nl
To free the self is but one radiant pace;\nl
Here to fulfil himself was God's desire.\nl

\spar Even while he stood on being's naked edge\nl
And all the passion and seeking of his soul\nl
Faced their extinction in some featureless Vast,\nl
The Presence he yearned for suddenly drew close.\nl
Across the silence of the ultimate Calm,\nl
Out of a marvellous Transcendence' core,\nl
A body of wonder and translucency\nl
As if a sweet mystic summary of her self\nl
Escaping into the original Bliss\nl
Had come enlarged out of eternity,\nl
Someone came infinite and absolute.\nl
A being of wisdom, power and delight,\nl
Even as a mother draws her child to her arms,\nl
Took to her breast Nature and world and soul.\nl
Abolishing the signless emptiness,\nl
Breaking the vacancy and voiceless hush,\nl
Piercing the limitless Unknowable,\nl
Into the liberty of the motionless depths\nl
A beautiful and felicitous lustre stole.\nl
The Power, the Light, the Bliss no word can speak\nl
Imaged itself in a surprising beam\nl
And built a golden passage to his heart\nl
Touching through him all longing sentient things.\nl
A moment's sweetness of the All-Beautiful\nl
Cancelled the vanity of the cosmic whirl.\nl
A Nature throbbing with a Heart divine\nl
Was felt in the unconscious universe;\nl
It made the breath a happy mystery.\nl
A love that bore the cross of pain with joy\nl
Eudaemonised the sorrow of the world,\nl
Page 312

Made happy the weight of long unending Time,\nl
The secret caught of God's felicity.\nl
Affirming in life a hidden ecstasy\nl
It held the spirit to its miraculous course;\nl
Carrying immortal values to the hours\nl
It justified the labour of the suns.\nl
For one was there supreme behind the God.\nl
A Mother Might brooded upon the world;\nl
A Consciousness revealed its marvellous front\nl
Transcending all that is, denying none:\nl
Imperishable above our fallen heads\nl
He felt a rapturous and unstumbling Force.\nl
The undying Truth appeared, the enduring Power\nl
Of all that here is made and then destroyed,\nl
The Mother of all godheads and all strengths\nl
Who, mediatrix, binds earth to the Supreme.\nl
The Enigma ceased that rules our nature's night,\nl
The covering Nescience was unmasked and slain;\nl
Its mind of error was stripped off from things\nl
And the dull moods of its perverting will.\nl
Illumined by her all-seeing identity\nl
Knowledge and Ignorance could strive no more;\nl
No longer could the titan Opposites,\nl
Antagonist poles of the world's artifice,\nl
Impose the illusion of their twofold screen\nl
Throwing their figures between us and her.\nl
The Wisdom was near, disguised by its own works,\nl
Of which the darkened universe is the robe.\nl
No more existence seemed an aimless fall,\nl
Extinction was no more the sole release.\nl
The hidden Word was found, the long-sought clue,\nl
Revealed was the meaning of our spirit's birth,\nl
Condemned to an imperfect body and mind,\nl
In the inconscience of material things\nl
And the indignity of mortal life.\nl
A Heart was felt in the spaces wide and bare,\nl
Page 313

A burning Love from white spiritual founts\nl
Annulled the sorrow of the ignorant depths;\nl
Suffering was lost in her immortal smile.\nl
A Life from beyond grew conqueror here of death;\nl
To err no more was natural to mind;\nl
Wrong could not come where all was light and love.\nl
The Formless and the Formed were joined in her:\nl
Immensity was exceeded by a look,\nl
A Face revealed the crowded Infinite.\nl
Incarnating inexpressibly in her limbs\nl
The boundless joy the blind world-forces seek,\nl
Her body of beauty mooned the seas of bliss.\nl
At the head she stands of birth and toil and fate,\nl
In their slow round the cycles turn to her call;\nl
Alone her hands can change Time's dragon base.\nl
Hers is the mystery the Night conceals;\nl
The spirit's alchemist energy is hers;\nl
She is the golden bridge, the wonderful fire.\nl
The luminous heart of the Unknown is she,\nl
A power of silence in the depths of God;\nl
She is the Force, the inevitable Word,\nl
The magnet of our difficult ascent,\nl
The Sun from which we kindle all our suns,\nl
The Light that leans from the unrealised Vasts,\nl
The joy that beckons from the impossible,\nl
The Might of all that never yet came down.\nl
All Nature dumbly calls to her alone\nl
To heal with her feet the aching throb of life\nl
And break the seals on the dim soul of man\nl
And kindle her fire in the closed heart of things.\nl
All here shall be one day her sweetness' home,\nl
All contraries prepare her harmony;\nl
Towards her our knowledge climbs, our passion gropes;\nl
In her miraculous rapture we shall dwell,\nl
Her clasp shall turn to ecstasy our pain.\nl
Our self shall be one self with all through her.\nl
Page 314

In her confirmed because transformed in her,\nl
Our life shall find in its fulfilled response\nl
Above, the boundless hushed beatitudes,\nl
Below, the wonder of the embrace divine.\nl
This known as in a thunder-flash of God,\nl
The rapture of things eternal filled his limbs;\nl
Amazement fell upon his ravished sense;\nl
His spirit was caught in her intolerant flame.\nl
Once seen, his heart acknowledged only her.\nl
Only a hunger of infinite bliss was left.\nl
All aims in her were lost, then found in her;\nl
His base was gathered to one pointing spire.\nl

\spar This was a seed cast into endless Time.\nl
A Word is spoken or a Light is shown,\nl
A moment sees, the ages toil to express.\nl
So flashing out of the Timeless leaped the worlds;\nl
An eternal instant is the cause of the years.\nl
All he had done was to prepare a field;\nl
His small beginnings asked for a mighty end:\nl
For all that he had been must now new-shape\nl
In him her joy to embody, to enshrine\nl
Her beauty and greatness in his house of life.\nl
But now his being was too wide for self;\nl
His heart's demand had grown immeasurable:\nl
His single freedom could not satisfy,\nl
Her light, her bliss he asked for earth and men.\nl
But vain are human power and human love\nl
To break earth's seal of ignorance and death;\nl
His nature's might seemed now an infant's grasp;\nl
Heaven is too high for outstretched hands to seize.\nl
This Light comes not by struggle or by thought;\nl
In the mind's silence the Transcendent acts\nl
And the hushed heart hears the unuttered Word.\nl
A vast surrender was his only strength.\nl
A Power that lives upon the heights must act,\nl
Page 315

Bring into life's closed room the Immortal's air\nl
And fill the finite with the Infinite.\nl
All that denies must be torn out and slain\nl
And crushed the many longings for whose sake\nl
We lose the One for whom our lives were made.\nl
Now other claims had hushed in him their cry:\nl
Only he longed to draw her presence and power\nl
Into his heart and mind and breathing frame;\nl
Only he yearned to call for ever down\nl
Her healing touch of love and truth and joy\nl
Into the darkness of the suffering world.\nl
His soul was freed and given to her alone.\nl

\sbigcap A mightier task remained than all he had done.\nl
To That he turned from which all being comes,\nl
A sign attending from the Secrecy\nl
Which knows the Truth ungrasped behind our thoughts\nl
And guards the world with its all-seeing gaze.\nl
In the unapproachable stillness of his soul,\nl
Intense, one-pointed, monumental, lone,\nl
Patient he sat like an incarnate hope\nl
Motionless on a pedestal of prayer.\nl
A strength he sought that was not yet on earth,\nl
Help from a Power too great for mortal will,\nl
The light of a Truth now only seen afar,\nl
A sanction from his high omnipotent Source.\nl
But from the appalling heights there stooped no voice;\nl
The timeless lids were closed; no opening came.\nl
A neutral helpless void oppressed the years.\nl
In the texture of our bound humanity\nl
He felt the stark resistance huge and dumb\nl
Of our inconscient and unseeing base,\nl
The stubborn mute rejection in life's depths,\nl
The ignorant No in the origin of things.\nl
A veiled collaboration with the Night\nl
Even in himself survived and hid from his view:\nl
Still something in his earthly being kept\nl
Its kinship with the Inconscient whence it came.\nl
A shadowy unity with a vanished past\nl
Treasured in an old-world frame was lurking there,\nl
Secret, unnoted by the illumined mind,\nl
And in subconscious whispers and in dream\nl
Still murmured at the mind's and spirit's choice.\nl
Its treacherous elements spread like slippery grains\nl
Page 317

Hoping the incoming Truth might stumble and fall,\nl
And old ideal voices wandering moaned\nl
And pleaded for a heavenly leniency\nl
To the gracious imperfections of our earth\nl
And the sweet weaknesses of our mortal state.\nl
This now he willed to discover and exile,\nl
The element in him betraying God.\nl
All Nature's recondite spaces were stripped bare,\nl
All her dim crypts and corners searched with fire\nl
Where refugee instincts and unshaped revolts\nl
Could shelter find in darkness' sanctuary\nl
Against the white purity of heaven's cleansing flame.\nl
All seemed to have perished that was undivine:\nl
Yet some minutest dissident might escape\nl
And still a centre lurk of the blind force.\nl
For the Inconscient too is infinite;\nl
The more its abysses we insist to sound,\nl
The more it stretches, stretches endlessly.\nl
Then lest a human cry should spoil the Truth\nl
He tore desire up from its bleeding roots\nl
And offered to the gods the vacant place.\nl
Thus could he bear the touch immaculate.\nl
A last and mightiest transformation came.\nl
His soul was all in front like a great sea\nl
Flooding the mind and body with its waves;\nl
His being, spread to embrace the universe,\nl
United the within and the without\nl
To make of life a cosmic harmony,\nl
An empire of the immanent Divine.\nl
In this tremendous universality\nl
Not only his soul-nature and mind-sense\nl
Included every soul and mind in his,\nl
But even the life of flesh and nerve was changed\nl
And grew one flesh and nerve with all that lives;\nl
He felt the joy of others as his joy,\nl
He bore the grief of others as his grief;\nl
Page 318

His universal sympathy upbore,\nl
Immense like ocean, the creation's load\nl
As earth upbears all beings' sacrifice,\nl
Thrilled with the hidden Transcendent's joy and peace.\nl
There was no more division's endless scroll;\nl
One grew the Spirit's secret unity,\nl
All Nature felt again the single bliss.\nl
There was no cleavage between soul and soul,\nl
There was no barrier between world and God.\nl
Overpowered were form and memory's limiting line;\nl
The covering mind was seized and torn apart;\nl
It was dissolved and now no more could be,\nl
The one Consciousness that made the world was seen;\nl
All now was luminosity and force.\nl
Abolished in its last thin fainting trace\nl
The circle of the little self was gone;\nl
The separate being could no more be felt;\nl
It disappeared and knew itself no more,\nl
Lost in the spirit's wide identity.\nl
His nature grew a movement of the All,\nl
Exploring itself to find that all was He,\nl
His soul was a delegation of the All\nl
That turned from itself to join the one Supreme.\nl
Transcended was the human formula;\nl
Man's heart that had obscured the Inviolable\nl
Assumed the mighty beating of a god's;\nl
His seeking mind ceased in the Truth that knows;\nl
His life was a flow of the universal life.\nl
He stood fulfilled on the world's highest line\nl
Awaiting the ascent beyond the world,\nl
Awaiting the descent the world to save.\nl
A Splendour and a Symbol wrapped the earth,\nl
Serene epiphanies looked and hallowed vasts\nl
Surrounded, wise infinitudes were close\nl
And bright remotenesses leaned near and kin.\nl
Sense failed in that tremendous lucency;\nl
Page 319

Ephemeral voices from his hearing fell\nl
And Thought potent no more sank large and pale\nl
Like a tired god into mysterious seas.\nl
The robes of mortal thinking were cast down\nl
Leaving his knowledge bare to absolute sight;\nl
Fate's driving ceased and Nature's sleepless spur:\nl
The athlete heavings of the will were stilled\nl
In the Omnipotent's unmoving peace.\nl
Life in his members lay down vast and mute;\nl
Naked, unwalled, unterrified it bore\nl
The immense regard of Immortality.\nl
The last movement died and all at once grew still.\nl
A weight that was the unseen Transcendent's hand\nl
Laid on his limbs the Spirit's measureless seal,\nl
Infinity swallowed him into shoreless trance.\nl

\spar As one who sets his sail towards mysteried shores\nl
Driven through huge oceans by the breath of God,\nl
The fathomless below, the unknown around,\nl
His soul abandoned the blind star-field, Space.\nl
Afar from all that makes the measured world,\nl
Plunging to hidden eternities it withdrew\nl
Back from mind's foaming surface to the Vasts\nl
Voiceless within us in omniscient sleep.\nl
Above the imperfect reach of word and thought,\nl
Beyond the sight that seeks support of form,\nl
Lost in deep tracts of superconscient Light,\nl
Or voyaging in blank featureless Nothingness,\nl
Sole in the trackless Incommensurable,\nl
Or past not-self and self and selflessness,\nl
Transgressing the dream-shores of conscious mind\nl
He reached at last his sempiternal base.\nl
On sorrowless heights no winging cry disturbs,\nl
Pure and untouched above this mortal play\nl
Is spread the spirit's hushed immobile air.\nl
There no beginning is and there no end;\nl
Page 320

There is the stable force of all that moves;\nl
There the aeonic labourer is at rest.\nl
There turns no keyed creation in the void,\nl
No giant mechanism watched by a soul;\nl
There creaks no fate-turned huge machinery;\nl
The marriage of evil with good within one breast,\nl
The clash of strife in the very clasp of love,\nl
The dangerous pain of life's experiment\nl
In the values of Inconsequence and Chance,\nl
The peril of mind's gamble, throwing our lives\nl
As stake in a wager of indifferent gods\nl
And the shifting lights and shadows of the idea\nl
Falling upon the surface consciousness,\nl
And in the dream of a mute witness soul\nl
Creating the error of a half-seen world\nl
Where knowledge is a seeking ignorance,\nl
Life's steps a stumbling series without suit,\nl
Its aspect of fortuitous design,\nl
Its equal measure of the true and false\nl
In that immobile and immutable realm\nl
Find no access, no cause, no right to live:\nl
There only reigns the spirit's motionless power\nl
Poised in itself through still eternity\nl
And its omniscient and omnipotent peace.\nl
Thought clashes not with thought and truth with truth,\nl
There is no war of right with rival right;\nl
There are no stumbling and half-seeing lives\nl
Passing from chance to unexpected chance,\nl
No suffering of hearts compelled to beat\nl
In bodies of the inert Inconscient's make.\nl
Armed with the immune occult unsinking Fire\nl
The guardians of Eternity keep its law\nl
For ever fixed upon Truth's giant base\nl
In her magnificent and termless home.\nl
There Nature on her dumb spiritual couch\nl
Immutably transcendent knows her source\nl
Page 321

And to the stir of multitudinous worlds\nl
Assents unmoved in a perpetual calm.\nl
All-causing, all-sustaining and aloof,\nl
The Witness looks from his unshaken poise,\nl
An Eye immense regarding all things done.\nl
Apart, at peace above creation's stir,\nl
Immersed in the eternal altitudes,\nl
He abode defended in his shoreless self,\nl
Companioned only by the all-seeing One.\nl
A Mind too mighty to be bound by Thought,\nl
A Life too boundless for the play in Space,\nl
A Soul without borders unconvinced of Time,\nl
He felt the extinction of the world's long pain,\nl
He became the unborn Self that never dies,\nl
He joined the sessions of Infinity.\nl
On the cosmic murmur primal loneliness fell,\nl
Annulled was the contact formed with time-born things,\nl
Empty grew Nature's wide community.\nl
All things were brought back to their formless seed,\nl
The world was silent for a cyclic hour.\nl
Although the afflicted Nature he had left\nl
Maintained beneath him her broad numberless fields,\nl
Her enormous act, receding, failed remote\nl
As if a soulless dream at last had ceased.\nl
No voice came down from the high Silences,\nl
None answered from her desolate solitudes.\nl
A stillness of cessation reigned, the wide\nl
Immortal hush before the gods are born;\nl
A universal Force awaited, mute,\nl
The veiled Transcendent's ultimate decree.\nl

\spar Then suddenly there came a downward look.\nl
As if a sea exploring its own depths,\nl
A living Oneness widened at its core\nl
And joined him to unnumbered multitudes.\nl
A Bliss, a Light, a Power, a flame-white Love\nl
Page 322

Caught all into a sole immense embrace;\nl
Existence found its truth on Oneness' breast\nl
And each became the self and space of all.\nl
The great world-rhythms were heart-beats of one Soul,\nl
To feel was a flame-discovery of God,\nl
All mind was a single harp of many strings,\nl
All life a song of many meeting lives;\nl
For worlds were many, but the Self was one.\nl
This knowledge now was made a cosmos' seed:\nl
This seed was cased in the safety of the Light,\nl
It needed not a sheath of Ignorance.\nl
Then from the trance of that tremendous clasp\nl
And from the throbbings of that single Heart\nl
And from the naked Spirit's victory\nl
A new and marvellous creation rose.\nl
Incalculable outflowing infinitudes\nl
Laughing out an unmeasured happiness\nl
Lived their innumerable unity;\nl
Worlds where the being is unbound and wide\nl
Bodied unthinkably the egoless Self;\nl
Rapture of beatific energies\nl
Joined Time to the Timeless, poles of a single joy;\nl
White vasts were seen where all is wrapped in all.\nl
There were no contraries, no sundered parts,\nl
All by spiritual links were joined to all\nl
And bound indissolubly to the One:\nl
Each was unique, but took all lives as his own,\nl
And, following out these tones of the Infinite,\nl
Recognised in himself the universe.\nl
A splendid centre of infinity's whirl\nl
Pushed to its zenith's height, its last expanse,\nl
Felt the divinity of its own self-bliss\nl
Repeated in its numberless other selves:\nl
It took up tirelessly into its scope\nl
Persons and figures of the Impersonal,\nl
As if prolonging in a ceaseless count,\nl
Page 323

In a rapturous multiplication's sum,\nl
The recurring decimals of eternity.\nl
None was apart, none lived for himself alone,\nl
Each lived for God in him and God in all,\nl
Each soleness inexpressibly held the whole.\nl
There Oneness was not tied to monotone;\nl
It showed a thousand aspects of itself,\nl
Its calm immutable stability\nl
Upbore on a changeless ground for ever safe,\nl
Compelled to a spontaneous servitude,\nl
The ever-changing incalculable steps,\nl
The seeming-reckless dance's subtle plan\nl
Of immense world-forces in their perfect play.\nl
Appearance looked back to its hidden truth\nl
And made of difference oneness' smiling play;\nl
It made all persons fractions of the Unique,\nl
Yet all were being's secret integers.\nl
All struggle was turned to a sweet strife of love\nl
In the harmonised circle of a sure embrace.\nl
Identity's reconciling happiness gave\nl
A rich security to difference.\nl
On a meeting line of hazardous extremes\nl
The game of games was played to its breaking-point,\nl
Where through self-finding by divine self-loss\nl
There leaps out unity's supreme delight\nl
Whose blissful undivided sweetness feels\nl
A communality of the Absolute.\nl
There was no sob of suffering anywhere;\nl
Experience ran from point to point of joy:\nl
Bliss was the pure undying truth of things.\nl
All Nature was a conscious front of God:\nl
A wisdom worked in all, self-moved, self-sure,\nl
A plenitude of illimitable Light,\nl
An authenticity of intuitive Truth,\nl
A glory and passion of creative Force.\nl
Infallible, leaping from eternity,\nl
Page 324

The moment's thought inspired the passing act.\nl
A word, a laughter, sprang from Silence' breast,\nl
A rhythm of Beauty in the calm of Space,\nl
A knowledge in the fathomless heart of Time.\nl
All turned to all without reserve's recoil:\nl
A single ecstasy without a break,\nl
Love was a close and thrilled identity\nl
In the throbbing heart of all that luminous life.\nl
A universal vision that unites,\nl
A sympathy of nerve replying to nerve,\nl
Hearing that listens to thought's inner sound\nl
And follows the rhythmic meanings of the heart,\nl
A touch that needs not hands to feel, to clasp,\nl
Were there the native means of consciousness\nl
And heightened the intimacy of soul with soul.\nl
A grand orchestra of spiritual powers,\nl
A diapason of soul-interchange\nl
Harmonised a Oneness deep, immeasurable.\nl
In these new worlds projected he became\nl
A portion of the universal gaze,\nl
A station of the all-inhabiting light,\nl
A ripple on a single sea of peace.\nl
His mind answered to countless communing minds,\nl
His words were syllables of the cosmos' speech,\nl
His life a field of the vast cosmic stir.\nl
He felt the footsteps of a million wills\nl
Moving in unison to a single goal.\nl
A stream ever new-born that never dies,\nl
Caught in its thousandfold current's ravishing flow,\nl
With eddies of immortal sweetness thrilled,\nl
He bore coiling through his members as they passed\nl
Calm movements of interminable delight,\nl
The bliss of a myriad myriads who are one.\nl

\spar In this vast outbreak of perfection's law\nl
Imposing its fixity on the flux of things\nl
Page 325

He saw a hierarchy of lucent planes\nl
Enfeoffed to this highest kingdom of God-state.\nl
Attuning to one Truth their own right rule\nl
Each housed the gladness of a bright degree,\nl
Alone in beauty, perfect in self-kind,\nl
An image cast by one deep truth's absolute,\nl
Married to all in happy difference.\nl
Each gave its powers to help its neighbours' parts,\nl
But suffered no diminution by the gift;\nl
Profiteers of a mystic interchange,\nl
They grew by what they took and what they gave,\nl
All others they felt as their own complements,\nl
One in the might and joy of multitude.\nl
Even in the poise where Oneness draws apart\nl
To feel the rapture of its separate selves,\nl
The Sole in its solitude yearned towards the All\nl
And the Many turned to look back at the One.\nl
An all-revealing all-creating Bliss,\nl
Seeking for forms to manifest truths divine,\nl
Aligned in their significant mystery\nl
The gleams of the symbols of the Ineffable\nl
Blazoned like hues upon a colourless air\nl
On the white purity of the Witness Soul.\nl
These hues were the very prism of the Supreme,\nl
His beauty, power, delight creation's cause.\nl
A vast Truth-Consciousness took up these signs\nl
To pass them on to some divine child Heart\nl
That looked on them with laughter and delight\nl
And joyed in these transcendent images\nl
Living and real as the truths they house.\nl
The Spirit's white neutrality became\nl
A playground of miracles, a rendezvous\nl
For the secret powers of a mystic Timelessness:\nl
It made of Space a marvel house of God,\nl
It poured through Time its works of ageless might,\nl
Unveiled seen as a luring rapturous face\nl
Page 326

The wonder and beauty of its Love and Force.\nl
The eternal Goddess moved in her cosmic house\nl
Sporting with God as a Mother with her child:\nl
To him the universe was her bosom of love,\nl
His toys were the immortal verities.\nl
All here self-lost had there its divine place.\nl
The Powers that here betray our hearts and err,\nl
Were there sovereign in truth, perfect in joy,\nl
Masters in a creation without flaw,\nl
Possessors of their own infinitude.\nl
There Mind, a splendid sun of vision's rays,\nl
Shaped substance by the glory of its thoughts\nl
And moved amidst the grandeur of its dreams.\nl
Imagination's great ensorcelling rod\nl
Summoned the unknown and gave to it a home,\nl
Outspread luxuriantly in golden air\nl
Truth's iris-coloured wings of fantasy,\nl
Or sang to the intuitive heart of joy\nl
Wonder's dream-notes that bring the Real close.\nl
Its power that makes the unknowable near and true,\nl
In the temple of the ideal shrined the One:\nl
It peopled thought and mind and happy sense\nl
Filled with bright aspects of the might of God\nl
And living persons of the one Supreme,\nl
The speech that voices the ineffable,\nl
The ray revealing unseen Presences,\nl
The virgin forms through which the Formless shines,\nl
The Word that ushers divine experience\nl
And the Ideas that crowd the Infinite.\nl
There was no gulf between the thought and fact,\nl
Ever they replied like bird to calling bird;\nl
The will obeyed the thought, the act the will.\nl
There was a harmony woven twixt soul and soul.\nl
A marriage with eternity divinised Time.\nl
There Life pursued, unwearied of her sport,\nl
Joy in her heart and laughter on her lips,\nl
Page 327

The bright adventure of God's game of chance.\nl
In her ingenious ardour of caprice,\nl
In her transfiguring mirth she mapped on Time\nl
A fascinating puzzle of events,\nl
Lured at each turn by new vicissitudes\nl
To self-discovery that could never cease.\nl
Ever she framed stark bonds for the will to break,\nl
Brought new creations for the thought's surprise\nl
And passionate ventures for the heart to dare,\nl
Where Truth recurred with an unexpected face\nl
Or else repeated old familiar joy\nl
Like the return of a delightful rhyme.\nl
At hide-and-seek on a Mother-Wisdom's breast,\nl
An artist teeming with her world-idea,\nl
She never could exhaust its numberless thoughts\nl
And vast adventure into thinking shapes\nl
And trial and lure of a new living's dreams.\nl
Untired of sameness and untired of change,\nl
Endlessly she unrolled her moving act,\nl
A mystery drama of divine delight,\nl
A living poem of world-ecstasy,\nl
A kakemono of significant forms,\nl
A coiled perspective of developing scenes,\nl
A brilliant chase of self-revealing shapes,\nl
An ardent hunt of soul looking for soul,\nl
A seeking and a finding as of gods.\nl
There Matter is the Spirit's firm density,\nl
An artistry of glad outwardness of self,\nl
A treasure-house of lasting images\nl
Where sense can build a world of pure delight:\nl
The home of a perpetual happiness,\nl
It lodged the hours as in a pleasant inn.\nl
The senses there were outlets of the soul;\nl
Even the youngest child-thought of the mind\nl
Incarnated some touch of highest things.\nl
There substance was a resonant harp of self,\nl
Page 328

A net for the constant lightnings of the spirit,\nl
A magnet power of love's intensity\nl
Whose yearning throb and adoration's cry\nl
Drew God's approaches close, sweet, wonderful.\nl
Its solidity was a mass of heavenly make;\nl
Its fixity and sweet permanence of charm\nl
Made a bright pedestal for felicity.\nl
Its bodies woven by a divine sense\nl
Prolonged the nearness of soul's clasp with soul;\nl
Its warm play of external sight and touch\nl
Reflected the glow and thrill of the heart's joy,\nl
Mind's climbing brilliant thoughts, the spirit's bliss;\nl
Life's rapture kept for ever its flame and cry.\nl
All that now passes lived immortal there\nl
In the proud beauty and fine harmony\nl
Of Matter plastic to spiritual light.\nl
Its ordered hours proclaimed the eternal Law;\nl
Vision reposed on a safety of deathless forms;\nl
Time was Eternity's transparent robe.\nl
An architect hewing out self's living rock,\nl
Phenomenon built Reality's summer-house\nl
On the beaches of the sea of Infinity.\nl

\spar Against this glory of spiritual states,\nl
Their parallels and yet their opposites,\nl
Floated and swayed, eclipsed and shadowlike\nl
As if a doubt made substance, flickering, pale,\nl
This other scheme two vast negations found.\nl
A world that knows not its inhabiting Self\nl
Labours to find its cause and need to be;\nl
A spirit ignorant of the world it made,\nl
Obscured by Matter, travestied by Life,\nl
Struggles to emerge, to be free, to know and reign;\nl
These were close-tied in one disharmony,\nl
Yet the divergent lines met not at all.\nl
Three Powers governed its irrational course,\nl
Page 329

In the beginning an unknowing Force,\nl
In the middle an embodied striving soul,\nl
In its end a silent spirit denying life.\nl
A dull and infelicitous interlude\nl
Unrolls its dubious truth to a questioning Mind\nl
Compelled by the ignorant Power to play its part\nl
And to record her inconclusive tale,\nl
The mystery of her inconscient plan\nl
And the riddle of a being born from Night\nl
By a marriage of Necessity with Chance.\nl
This darkness hides our nobler destiny.\nl
A chrysalis of a great and glorious truth,\nl
It stifles the winged marvel in its sheath\nl
Lest from the prison of Matter it escape\nl
And, wasting its beauty on the formless Vast,\nl
Merged into the Unknowable's mystery,\nl
Leave unfulfilled the world's miraculous fate.\nl
As yet thought only some high spirit's dream\nl
Or a vexed illusion in man's toiling mind,\nl
A new creation from the old shall rise,\nl
A Knowledge inarticulate find speech,\nl
Beauty suppressed burst into paradise bloom,\nl
Pleasure and pain dive into absolute bliss.\nl
A tongueless oracle shall speak at last,\nl
The Superconscient conscious grow on earth,\nl
The Eternal's wonders join the dance of Time.\nl
But now all seemed a vainly teeming vast\nl
Upheld by a deluded Energy\nl
To a spectator self-absorbed and mute,\nl
Careless of the unmeaning show he watched,\nl
Regarding the bizarre procession pass\nl
Like one who waits for an expected end.\nl
He saw a world that is from a world to be.\nl
There he divined rather than saw or felt,\nl
Far off upon the rim of consciousness,\nl
Transient and frail this little whirling globe\nl
Page 330

And on it left like a lost dream's vain mould,\nl
A fragile copy of the spirit's shell,\nl
His body gathered into mystic sleep.\nl
A foreign shape it seemed, a mythic shade.\nl

\spar Alien now seemed that dim far universe,\nl
Self and eternity alone were true.\nl
Then memory climbed to him from the striving planes\nl
Bringing a cry from once-loved cherished things,\nl
And to the cry as to its own lost call\nl
A ray replied from the occult Supreme.\nl
For even there the boundless Oneness dwells.\nl
To its own sight unrecognisable,\nl
It lived still sunk in its own tenebrous seas,\nl
Upholding the world's inconscient unity\nl
Hidden in Matter's insentient multitude.\nl
This seed-self sown in the Indeterminate\nl
Forfeits its glory of divinity,\nl
Concealing the omnipotence of its Force,\nl
Concealing the omniscience of its Soul;\nl
An agent of its own transcendent Will,\nl
It merges knowledge in the inconscient deep;\nl
Accepting error, sorrow, death and pain,\nl
It pays the ransom of the ignorant Night,\nl
Redeeming by its substance Nature's fall.\nl
Himself he knew and why his soul had gone\nl
Into earth's passionate obscurity\nl
To share the labour of an errant Power\nl
Which by division hopes to find the One.\nl
Two beings he was, one wide and free above,\nl
One struggling, bound, intense, its portion here.\nl
A tie between them still could bridge two worlds;\nl
There was a dim response, a distant breath;\nl
All had not ceased in the unbounded hush.\nl
His heart lay somewhere conscious and alone\nl
Far down below him like a lamp in night;\nl
Page 331

Abandoned it lay, alone, imperishable,\nl
Immobile with excess of passionate will,\nl
His living, sacrificed and offered heart\nl
Absorbed in adoration mystical,\nl
Turned to its far-off fount of light and love.\nl
In the luminous stillness of its mute appeal\nl
It looked up to the heights it could not see;\nl
It yearned from the longing depths it could not leave.\nl
In the centre of his vast and fateful trance\nl
Half-way between his free and fallen selves,\nl
Interceding twixt God's day and the mortal's night,\nl
Accepting worship as its single law,\nl
Accepting bliss as the sole cause of things,\nl
Refusing the austere joy which none can share,\nl
Refusing the calm that lives for calm alone,\nl
To her it turned for whom it willed to be.\nl
In the passion of its solitary dream\nl
It lay like a closed soundless oratory\nl
Where sleeps a consecrated argent floor\nl
Lit by a single and untrembling ray\nl
And an invisible Presence kneels in prayer.\nl
On some deep breast of liberating peace\nl
All else was satisfied with quietude;\nl
This only knew there was a truth beyond.\nl
All other parts were dumb in centred sleep\nl
Consenting to the slow deliberate Power\nl
Which tolerates the world's error and its grief,\nl
Consenting to the cosmic long delay,\nl
Timelessly waiting through the patient years\nl
Her coming they had asked for earth and men;\nl
This was the fiery point that called her now.\nl
Extinction could not quench that lonely fire;\nl
Its seeing filled the blank of mind and will;\nl
Thought dead, its changeless force abode and grew.\nl
Armed with the intuition of a bliss\nl
To which some moved tranquillity was the key,\nl
Page 332

It persevered through life's huge emptiness\nl
Amid the blank denials of the world.\nl
It sent its voiceless prayer to the Unknown;\nl
It listened for the footsteps of its hopes\nl
Returning through the void immensities,\nl
It waited for the fiat of the Word\nl
That comes through the still self from the Supreme.\nl

\sbigcap Then suddenly there rose a sacred stir.\nl
Amid the lifeless silence of the Void\nl
In a solitude and an immensity\nl
A sound came quivering like a loved footfall\nl
Heard in the listening spaces of the soul;\nl
A touch perturbed his fibres with delight.\nl
An Influence had approached the mortal range,\nl
A boundless Heart was near his longing heart,\nl
A mystic Form enveloped his earthly shape.\nl
All at her contact broke from silence' seal;\nl
Spirit and body thrilled identified,\nl
Linked in the grasp of an unspoken joy;\nl
Mind, members, life were merged in ecstasy.\nl
Intoxicated as with nectarous rain\nl
His nature's passioning stretches flowed to her,\nl
Flashing with lightnings, mad with luminous wine.\nl
All was a limitless sea that heaved to the moon.\nl
A divinising stream possessed his veins,\nl
His body's cells awoke to spirit sense,\nl
Each nerve became a burning thread of joy:\nl
Tissue and flesh partook beatitude.\nl
Alight, the dun unplumbed subconscient caves\nl
Thrilled with the prescience of her longed-for tread\nl
And filled with flickering crests and praying tongues.\nl
Even lost in slumber, mute, inanimate\nl
His very body answered to her power.\nl
The One he worshipped was within him now:\nl
Flame-pure, ethereal-tressed, a mighty Face\nl
Appeared and lips moved by immortal words;\nl
Lids, Wisdom's leaves, drooped over rapture's orbs.\nl
A marble monument of ponderings, shone\nl
Page 334

A forehead, sight's crypt, and large like ocean's gaze\nl
Towards Heaven, two tranquil eyes of boundless thought\nl
Looked into man's and saw the god to come.\nl
A Shape was seen on threshold Mind, a Voice\nl
Absolute and wise in the heart's chambers spoke:\nl
“O Son of Strength who climbst creation's peaks,\nl
No soul is thy companion in the light;\nl
Alone thou standest at the eternal doors.\nl
What thou hast won is thine, but ask no more.\nl
O Spirit aspiring in an ignorant frame,\nl
O Voice arisen from the Inconscient's world,\nl
How shalt thou speak for men whose hearts are dumb,\nl
Make purblind earth the soul's seer-vision's home\nl
Or lighten the burden of the senseless globe?\nl
I am the Mystery beyond reach of mind,\nl
I am the goal of the travail of the suns;\nl
My fire and sweetness are the cause of life.\nl
But too immense my danger and my joy.\nl
Awake not the immeasurable descent,\nl
Speak not my secret name to hostile Time;\nl
Man is too weak to bear the Infinite's weight.\nl
Truth born too soon might break the imperfect earth.\nl
Leave the all-seeing Power to hew its way:\nl
In thy single vast achievement reign apart\nl
Helping the world with thy great lonely days.\nl
I ask thee not to merge thy heart of flame\nl
In the Immobile's wide uncaring bliss,\nl
Turned from the fruitless motion of the years,\nl
Deserting the fierce labour of the worlds,\nl
Aloof from beings, lost in the Alone.\nl
How shall thy mighty spirit brook repose\nl
While Death is still unconquered on the earth\nl
And Time a field of suffering and pain?\nl
Thy soul was born to share the laden Force;\nl
Obey thy nature and fulfil thy fate:\nl
Accept the difficulty and godlike toil,\nl
Page 335

For the slow-paced omniscient purpose live.\nl
The Enigma's knot is tied in humankind.\nl
A lightning from the heights that think and plan,\nl
Ploughing the air of life with vanishing trails,\nl
Man, sole awake in an unconscious world,\nl
Aspires in vain to change the cosmic dream.\nl
Arrived from some half-luminous Beyond\nl
He is a stranger in the mindless vasts;\nl
A traveller in his oft-shifting home\nl
Amid the tread of many infinities,\nl
He has pitched a tent of life in desert Space.\nl
Heaven's fixed regard beholds him from above,\nl
In the house of Nature a perturbing guest,\nl
A voyager twixt Thought's inconstant shores,\nl
A hunter of unknown and beautiful Powers,\nl
A nomad of the far mysterious Light,\nl
In the wide ways a little spark of God.\nl
Against his spirit all is in dire league,\nl
A Titan influence stops his Godward gaze.\nl
Around him hungers the unpitying Void,\nl
The eternal Darkness seeks him with her hands,\nl
Inscrutable Energies drive him and deceive,\nl
Immense implacable deities oppose.\nl
An inert Soul and a somnambulist Force\nl
Have made a world estranged from life and thought;\nl
The Dragon of the dark foundations keeps\nl
Unalterable the law of Chance and Death;\nl
On his long way through Time and Circumstance\nl
The grey-hued riddling nether shadow-Sphinx,\nl
Her dreadful paws upon the swallowing sands,\nl
Awaits him armed with the soul-slaying word:\nl
Across his path sits the dim camp of Night.\nl
His day is a moment in perpetual Time;\nl
He is the prey of the minutes and the hours.\nl
Assailed on earth and unassured of heaven,\nl
Descended here unhappy and sublime,\nl
Page 336

A link between the demigod and the beast,\nl
He knows not his own greatness nor his aim;\nl
He has forgotten why he has come and whence.\nl
His spirit and his members are at war;\nl
His heights break off too low to reach the skies,\nl
His mass is buried in the animal mire.\nl
A strange antinomy is his nature's rule.\nl
A riddle of opposites is made his field:\nl
Freedom he asks but needs to live in bonds,\nl
He has need of darkness to perceive some light\nl
And need of grief to feel a little bliss;\nl
He has need of death to find a greater life.\nl
All sides he sees and turns to every call;\nl
He has no certain light by which to walk;\nl
His life is a blind-man's-buff, a hide-and-seek;\nl
He seeks himself and from himself he runs;\nl
Meeting himself, he thinks it other than he.\nl
Always he builds, but finds no constant ground,\nl
Always he journeys, but nowhere arrives;\nl
He would guide the world, himself he cannot guide;\nl
He would save his soul, his life he cannot save.\nl
The light his soul had brought his mind has lost;\nl
All he has learned is soon again in doubt;\nl
A sun to him seems the shadow of his thoughts,\nl
Then all is shadow again and nothing true:\nl
Unknowing what he does or whither he tends\nl
He fabricates signs of the Real in Ignorance.\nl
He has hitched his mortal error to Truth's star.\nl
Wisdom attracts him with her luminous masks,\nl
But never has he seen the face behind:\nl
A giant Ignorance surrounds his lore.\nl
Assigned to meet the cosmic mystery\nl
In the dumb figure of a material world,\nl
His passport of entry false and his personage,\nl
He is compelled to be what he is not;\nl
He obeys the Inconscience he had come to rule\nl
Page 337

And sinks in Matter to fulfil his soul.\nl
Awakened from her lower driven forms\nl
The Earth-Mother gave her forces to his hands\nl
And painfully he guards the heavy trust;\nl
His mind is a lost torch-bearer on her roads.\nl
Illumining breath to think and plasm to feel,\nl
He labours with his slow and sceptic brain\nl
Helped by the reason's vacillating fires,\nl
To make his thought and will a magic door\nl
For knowledge to enter the darkness of the world\nl
And love to rule a realm of strife and hate.\nl
A mind impotent to reconcile heaven and earth\nl
And tied to Matter with a thousand bonds,\nl
He lifts himself to be a conscious god.\nl
Even when a glory of wisdom crowns his brow,\nl
When mind and spirit shed a grandiose ray\nl
To exalt this product of the sperm and gene,\nl
This alchemist's miracle from plasm and gas,\nl
And he who shared the animal's run and crawl\nl
Lifts his thought-stature to the Immortal's heights,\nl
His life still keeps the human middle way;\nl
His body he resigns to death and pain,\nl
Abandoning Matter, his too heavy charge.\nl
A thaumaturge sceptic of miracles,\nl
A spirit left sterile of its occult power\nl
By an unbelieving brain and credulous heart,\nl
He leaves the world to end where it began:\nl
His work unfinished he claims a heavenly prize.\nl
Thus has he missed creation's absolute.\nl
Half-way he stops his star of destiny:\nl
A vast and vain long-tried experiment,\nl
An ill-served high conception doubtfully done,\nl
The world's life falters on not seeing its goal,—\nl
A zigzag towards unknown dangerous ground\nl
Ever repeating its habitual walk,\nl
Ever retreating after marches long\nl
Page 338

And hardiest victories without sure result,\nl
Drawn endlessly an inconclusive game.\nl
In an ill-fitting and voluminous robe\nl
A radiant purpose still conceals its face,\nl
A mighty blindness stumbles hoping on,\nl
Feeding its strength on gifts of luminous Chance.\nl
Because the human instrument has failed,\nl
The Godhead frustrate sleeps within its seed,\nl
A spirit entangled in the forms it made.\nl
His failure is not failure whom God leads;\nl
Through all the slow mysterious march goes on:\nl
An immutable Power has made this mutable world;\nl
A self-fulfilling transcendence treads man's road;\nl
The driver of the soul upon its path,\nl
It knows its steps, its way is inevitable,\nl
And how shall the end be vain when God is guide?\nl
However man's mind may tire or fail his flesh,\nl
A will prevails cancelling his conscious choice:\nl
The goal recedes, a bourneless vastness calls\nl
Retreating into an immense Unknown;\nl
There is no end to the world's stupendous march,\nl
There is no rest for the embodied soul.\nl
It must live on, describe all Time's huge curve.\nl
An Influx presses from the closed Beyond\nl
Forbidding to him rest and earthly ease,\nl
Till he has found himself he cannot pause.\nl
A Light there is that leads, a Power that aids;\nl
Unmarked, unfelt it sees in him and acts:\nl
Ignorant, he forms the All-Conscient in his depths,\nl
Human, looks up to superhuman peaks:\nl
A borrower of Supernature's gold,\nl
He paves his road to Immortality.\nl
The high gods look on man and watch and choose\nl
Today's impossibles for the future's base.\nl
His transience trembles with the Eternal's touch,\nl
His barriers cede beneath the Infinite's tread;\nl
Page 339

The Immortals have their entries in his life:\nl
The Ambassadors of the Unseen draw near.\nl
A splendour sullied by the mortal air,\nl
Love passes through his heart, a wandering guest.\nl
Beauty surrounds him for a magic hour,\nl
He has visits of a large revealing joy,\nl
Brief widenesses release him from himself,\nl
Enticing towards a glory ever in front\nl
Hopes of a deathless sweetness lure and leave.\nl
His mind is crossed by strange discovering fires,\nl
Rare intimations lift his stumbling speech\nl
To a moment's kinship with the eternal Word;\nl
A masque of Wisdom circles through his brain\nl
Perturbing him with glimpses half divine.\nl
He lays his hands sometimes on the Unknown;\nl
He communes sometimes with Eternity.\nl
A strange and grandiose symbol was his birth\nl
And immortality and spirit-room\nl
And pure perfection and a shadowless bliss\nl
Are this afflicted creature's mighty fate.\nl
In him the Earth-Mother sees draw near the change\nl
Foreshadowed in her dumb and fiery depths,\nl
A godhead drawn from her transmuted limbs,\nl
An alchemy of Heaven on Nature's base.\nl
Adept of the self-born unfailing line,\nl
Leave not the light to die the ages bore,\nl
Help still humanity's blind and suffering life:\nl
Obey thy spirit's wide omnipotent urge.\nl
A witness to God's parley with the Night,\nl
It leaned compassionate from immortal calm\nl
And housed desire, the troubled seed of things.\nl
Assent to thy high self, create, endure.\nl
Cease not from knowledge, let thy toil be vast.\nl
No more can earthly limits pen thy force;\nl
Equal thy work with long unending Time's.\nl
Traveller upon the bare eternal heights,\nl
Page 340

Tread still the difficult and dateless path\nl
Joining the cycles with its austere curve\nl
Measured for man by the initiate Gods.\nl
My light shall be in thee, my strength thy force.\nl
Let not the impatient Titan drive thy heart,\nl
Ask not the imperfect fruit, the partial prize.\nl
Only one boon, to greaten thy spirit, demand;\nl
Only one joy, to raise thy kind, desire.\nl
Above blind fate and the antagonist powers\nl
Moveless there stands a high unchanging Will;\nl
To its omnipotence leave thy work's result.\nl
All things shall change in God's transfiguring hour.”\nl

\spar August and sweet sank hushed that mighty Voice.\nl
Nothing now moved in the vast brooding space:\nl
A stillness came upon the listening world,\nl
A mute immensity of the Eternal's peace.\nl
But Aswapati's heart replied to her,\nl
A cry amid the silence of the Vasts:\nl
“How shall I rest content with mortal days\nl
And the dull measure of terrestrial things,\nl
I who have seen behind the cosmic mask\nl
The glory and the beauty of thy face?\nl
Hard is the doom to which thou bindst thy sons!\nl
How long shall our spirits battle with the Night\nl
And bear defeat and the brute yoke of Death,\nl
We who are vessels of a deathless Force\nl
And builders of the godhead of the race?\nl
Or if it is thy work I do below\nl
Amid the error and waste of human life\nl
In the vague light of man's half-conscious mind,\nl
Why breaks not in some distant gleam of thee?\nl
Ever the centuries and millenniums pass.\nl
Where in the greyness is thy coming's ray?\nl
Where is the thunder of thy victory's wings?\nl
Only we hear the feet of passing gods.\nl
Page 341

A plan in the occult eternal Mind\nl
Mapped out to backward and prophetic sight,\nl
The aeons ever repeat their changeless round,\nl
The cycles all rebuild and ever aspire.\nl
All we have done is ever still to do.\nl
All breaks and all renews and is the same.\nl
Huge revolutions of life's fruitless gyre,\nl
The new-born ages perish like the old,\nl
As if the sad Enigma kept its right\nl
Till all is done for which this scene was made.\nl
Too little the strength that now with us is born,\nl
Too faint the light that steals through Nature's lids,\nl
Too scant the joy with which she buys our pain.\nl
In a brute world that knows not its own sense,\nl
Thought-racked upon the wheel of birth we live,\nl
The instruments of an impulse not our own\nl
Moved to achieve with our heart's blood for price\nl
Half-knowledge, half-creations that soon tire.\nl
A foiled immortal soul in perishing limbs,\nl
Baffled and beaten back we labour still;\nl
Annulled, frustrated, spent, we still survive.\nl
In anguish we labour that from us may rise\nl
A larger-seeing man with nobler heart,\nl
A golden vessel of the incarnate Truth,\nl
The executor of the divine attempt\nl
Equipped to wear the earthly body of God,\nl
Communicant and prophet and lover and king.\nl
I know that thy creation cannot fail:\nl
For even through the mists of mortal thought\nl
Infallible are thy mysterious steps,\nl
And, though Necessity dons the garb of Chance,\nl
Hidden in the blind shifts of Fate she keeps\nl
The slow calm logic of Infinity's pace\nl
And the inviolate sequence of its will.\nl
All life is fixed in an ascending scale\nl
And adamantine is the evolving Law;\nl
Page 342

In the beginning is prepared the close.\nl
This strange irrational product of the mire,\nl
This compromise between the beast and god,\nl
Is not the crown of thy miraculous world.\nl
I know there shall inform the inconscient cells,\nl
At one with Nature and at height with heaven,\nl
A spirit vast as the containing sky\nl
And swept with ecstasy from invisible founts,\nl
A god come down and greater by the fall.\nl
A Power arose out of my slumber's cell.\nl
Abandoning the tardy limp of the hours\nl
And the inconstant blink of mortal sight,\nl
There where the Thinker sleeps in too much light\nl
And intolerant flames the lone all-witnessing Eye\nl
Hearing the word of Fate from Silence' heart\nl
In the endless moment of Eternity,\nl
It saw from timelessness the works of Time.\nl
Overpassed were the leaden formulas of the Mind,\nl
Overpowered the obstacle of mortal Space:\nl
The unfolding Image showed the things to come.\nl
A giant dance of Shiva tore the past;\nl
There was a thunder as of worlds that fall;\nl
Earth was o'errun with fire and the roar of Death\nl
Clamouring to slay a world his hunger had made;\nl
There was a clangour of Destruction's wings:\nl
The Titan's battle-cry was in my ears,\nl
Alarm and rumour shook the armoured Night.\nl
I saw the Omnipotent's flaming pioneers\nl
Over the heavenly verge which turns towards life\nl
Come crowding down the amber stairs of birth;\nl
Forerunners of a divine multitude,\nl
Out of the paths of the morning star they came\nl
Into the little room of mortal life.\nl
I saw them cross the twilight of an age,\nl
The sun-eyed children of a marvellous dawn,\nl
The great creators with wide brows of calm,\nl
Page 343

The massive barrier-breakers of the world\nl
And wrestlers with destiny in her lists of will,\nl
The labourers in the quarries of the gods,\nl
The messengers of the Incommunicable,\nl
The architects of immortality.\nl
Into the fallen human sphere they came,\nl
Faces that wore the Immortal's glory still,\nl
Voices that communed still with the thoughts of God,\nl
Bodies made beautiful by the spirit's light,\nl
Carrying the magic word, the mystic fire,\nl
Carrying the Dionysian cup of joy,\nl
Approaching eyes of a diviner man,\nl
Lips chanting an unknown anthem of the soul,\nl
Feet echoing in the corridors of Time.\nl
High priests of wisdom, sweetness, might and bliss,\nl
Discoverers of beauty's sunlit ways\nl
And swimmers of Love's laughing fiery floods\nl
And dancers within rapture's golden doors,\nl
Their tread one day shall change the suffering earth\nl
And justify the light on Nature's face.\nl
Although Fate lingers in the high Beyond\nl
And the work seems vain on which our heart's force was spent,\nl
All shall be done for which our pain was borne.\nl
Even as of old man came behind the beast\nl
This high divine successor surely shall come\nl
Behind man's inefficient mortal pace,\nl
Behind his vain labour, sweat and blood and tears:\nl
He shall know what mortal mind barely durst think,\nl
He shall do what the heart of the mortal could not dare.\nl
Inheritor of the toil of human time,\nl
He shall take on him the burden of the gods;\nl
All heavenly light shall visit the earth's thoughts,\nl
The might of heaven shall fortify earthly hearts;\nl
Earth's deeds shall touch the superhuman's height,\nl
Earth's seeing widen into the infinite.\nl
Heavy unchanged weighs still the imperfect world;\nl
Page 344

The splendid youth of Time has passed and failed;\nl
Heavy and long are the years our labour counts\nl
And still the seals are firm upon man's soul\nl
And weary is the ancient Mother's heart.\nl
O Truth defended in thy secret sun,\nl
Voice of her mighty musings in shut heavens\nl
On things withdrawn within her luminous depths,\nl
O Wisdom-Splendour, Mother of the universe,\nl
Creatrix, the Eternal's artist Bride,\nl
Linger not long with thy transmuting hand\nl
Pressed vainly on one golden bar of Time,\nl
As if Time dare not open its heart to God.\nl
O radiant fountain of the world's delight\nl
World-free and unattainable above,\nl
O Bliss who ever dwellst deep-hid within\nl
While men seek thee outside and never find,\nl
Mystery and Muse with hieratic tongue,\nl
Incarnate the white passion of thy force,\nl
Mission to earth some living form of thee.\nl
One moment fill with thy eternity,\nl
Let thy infinity in one body live,\nl
All-Knowledge wrap one mind in seas of light,\nl
All-Love throb single in one human heart.\nl
Immortal, treading the earth with mortal feet\nl
All heaven's beauty crowd in earthly limbs!\nl
Omnipotence, girdle with the power of God\nl
Movements and moments of a mortal will,\nl
Pack with the eternal might one human hour\nl
And with one gesture change all future time.\nl
Let a great word be spoken from the heights\nl
And one great act unlock the doors of Fate.”\nl

\spar His prayer sank down in the resisting Night\nl
Oppressed by the thousand forces that deny,\nl
As if too weak to climb to the Supreme.\nl
But there arose a wide consenting Voice;\nl
Page 345

The spirit of beauty was revealed in sound:\nl
Light floated round the marvellous Vision's brow\nl
And on her lips the Immortal's joy took shape.\nl
“O strong forerunner, I have heard thy cry.\nl
One shall descend and break the iron Law,\nl
Change Nature's doom by the lone spirit's power.\nl
A limitless Mind that can contain the world,\nl
A sweet and violent heart of ardent calms\nl
Moved by the passions of the gods shall come.\nl
All mights and greatnesses shall join in her;\nl
Beauty shall walk celestial on the earth,\nl
Delight shall sleep in the cloud-net of her hair,\nl
And in her body as on his homing tree\nl
Immortal Love shall beat his glorious wings.\nl
A music of griefless things shall weave her charm;\nl
The harps of the Perfect shall attune her voice,\nl
The streams of Heaven shall murmur in her laugh,\nl
Her lips shall be the honeycombs of God,\nl
Her limbs his golden jars of ecstasy,\nl
Her breasts the rapture-flowers of Paradise.\nl
She shall bear Wisdom in her voiceless bosom,\nl
Strength shall be with her like a conqueror's sword\nl
And from her eyes the Eternal's bliss shall gaze.\nl
A seed shall be sown in Death's tremendous hour,\nl
A branch of heaven transplant to human soil;\nl
Nature shall overleap her mortal step;\nl
Fate shall be changed by an unchanging will.”\nl

\spar As a flame disappears in endless Light\nl
Immortally extinguished in its source,\nl
Vanished the splendour and was stilled the word.\nl
An echo of delight that once was close,\nl
The harmony journeyed towards some distant hush,\nl
A music failing in the ear of trance,\nl
A cadence called by distant cadences,\nl
A voice that trembled into strains withdrawn.\nl
Page 346

Her form retreated from the longing earth\nl
Forsaking nearness to the abandoned sense,\nl
Ascending to her unattainable home.\nl
Lone, brilliant, vacant lay the inner fields;\nl
All was unfilled inordinate spirit space,\nl
Indifferent, waste, a desert of bright peace.\nl
Then a line moved on the far edge of calm:\nl
The warm-lipped sentient soft terrestrial wave,\nl
A quick and many-murmured moan and laugh,\nl
Came gliding in upon white feet of sound.\nl
Unlocked was the deep glory of Silence' heart;\nl
The absolute unmoving stillnesses\nl
Surrendered to the breath of mortal air,\nl
Dissolving boundlessly the heavens of trance\nl
Collapsed to waking mind. Eternity\nl
Cast down its incommunicable lids\nl
Over its solitudes remote from ken\nl
Behind the voiceless mystery of sleep.\nl
The grandiose respite failed, the wide release.\nl
Across the light of fast-receding planes\nl
That fled from him as from a falling star,\nl
Compelled to fill its human house in Time\nl
His soul drew back into the speed and noise\nl
Of the vast business of created things.\nl
A chariot of the marvels of the heavens\nl
Broad-based to bear the gods on fiery wheels,\nl
Flaming he swept through the spiritual gates.\nl
The mortal stir received him in its midst.\nl
Once more he moved amid material scenes,\nl
Lifted by intimations from the heights\nl
And in the pauses of the building brain\nl
Touched by the thoughts that skim the fathomless surge\nl
Of Nature and wing back to hidden shores.\nl
The eternal seeker in the aeonic field\nl
Besieged by the intolerant press of hours\nl
Again was strong for great swift-footed deeds.\nl
Page 347

Awake beneath the ignorant vault of Night,\nl
He saw the unnumbered people of the stars\nl
And heard the questioning of the unsatisfied flood\nl
And toiled with the form-maker, measuring Mind.\nl
A wanderer from the occult invisible suns\nl
Accomplishing the fate of transient things,\nl
A god in the figure of the arisen beast,\nl
He raised his brow of conquest to the heavens\nl
Establishing the empire of the soul\nl
On Matter and its bounded universe\nl
As on a solid rock in infinite seas.\nl
The Lord of Life resumed his mighty rounds\nl
In the scant field of the ambiguous globe.\nl

\sbigcap A Maenad of the cycles of desire\nl
Around a Light she must not dare to touch,\nl
Hastening towards a far-off unknown goal\nl
Earth followed the endless journey of the Sun.\nl
A mind but half-awake in the swing of the void\nl
On the bosom of Inconscience dreamed out life\nl
And bore this finite world of thought and deed\nl
Across the immobile trance of the Infinite.\nl
A vast immutable silence with her ran:\nl
Prisoner of speed upon a jewelled wheel,\nl
She communed with the mystic heart in Space.\nl
Amid the ambiguous stillness of the stars\nl
She moved towards some undisclosed event\nl
And her rhythm measured the long whirl of Time.\nl
In ceaseless motion round the purple rim\nl
Day after day sped by like coloured spokes,\nl
And through a glamour of shifting hues of air\nl
The seasons drew in linked significant dance\nl
The symbol pageant of the changing year.\nl
Across the burning languor of the soil\nl
Paced Summer with his pomp of violent noons\nl
And stamped his tyranny of torrid light\nl
And the blue seal of a great burnished sky.\nl
Next through its fiery swoon or clotted knot\nl
Rain-tide burst in upon torn wings of heat,\nl
Startled with lightnings air's unquiet drowse,\nl
Lashed with life-giving streams the torpid soil,\nl
Overcast with flare and sound and storm-winged dark\nl
The star-defended doors of heaven's dim sleep,\nl
Or from the gold eye of her paramour\nl
Covered with packed cloud-veils the earth's brown face.\nl
Page 349

Armies of revolution crossed the time-field,\nl
The clouds' unending march besieged the world,\nl
Tempests' pronunciamentos claimed the sky\nl
And thunder drums announced the embattled gods.\nl
A traveller from unquiet neighbouring seas,\nl
The dense-maned monsoon rode neighing through earth's hours:\nl
Thick now the emissary javelins:\nl
Enormous lightnings split the horizon's rim\nl
And, hurled from the quarters as from contending camps,\nl
Married heaven's edges steep and bare and blind:\nl
A surge and hiss and onset of huge rain,\nl
The long straight sleet-drift, clamours of winged storm-charge,\nl
Throngs of wind-faces, rushing of wind-feet\nl
Hurrying swept through the prone afflicted plains:\nl
Heaven's waters trailed and dribbled through the drowned land.\nl
Then all was a swift stride, a sibilant race,\nl
Or all was tempest's shout and water's fall.\nl
A dimness sagged on the grey floor of day,\nl
Its dingy sprawling length joined morn to eve,\nl
Wallowing in sludge and shower it reached black dark.\nl
Day a half darkness wore as its dull dress.\nl
Light looked into dawn's tarnished glass and met\nl
Its own face there, twin to a half-lit night's:\nl
Downpour and drip and seeping mist swayed all\nl
And turned dry soil to bog and reeking mud:\nl
Earth was a quagmire, heaven a dismal block.\nl
None saw through dank drenched weeks the dungeon sun.\nl
Even when no turmoil vexed air's sombre rest,\nl
Or a faint ray glimmered through weeping clouds\nl
As a sad smile gleams veiled by returning tears,\nl
All promised brightness failed at once denied\nl
Or, soon condemned, died like a brief-lived hope.\nl
Then a last massive deluge thrashed dead mire\nl
And a subsiding mutter left all still,\nl
Or only the muddy creep of sinking floods\nl
Or only a whisper and green toss of trees.\nl
Page 350

Earth's mood now changed; she lay in lulled repose,\nl
The hours went by with slow contented tread:\nl
A wide and tranquil air remembered peace,\nl
Earth was the comrade of a happy sun.\nl
A calmness neared as of the approach of God,\nl
A light of musing trance lit soil and sky\nl
And an identity and ecstasy\nl
Filled meditation's solitary heart.\nl
A dream loitered in the dumb mind of Space,\nl
Time opened its chambers of felicity,\nl
An exaltation entered and a hope:\nl
An inmost self looked up to a heavenlier height,\nl
An inmost thought kindled a hidden flame\nl
And the inner sight adored an unseen sun.\nl
Three thoughtful seasons passed with shining tread\nl
And scanning one by one the pregnant hours\nl
Watched for a flame that lurked in luminous depths,\nl
The vigil of some mighty birth to come.\nl
Autumn led in the glory of her moons\nl
And dreamed in the splendour of her lotus pools\nl
And Winter and Dew-time laid their calm cool hands\nl
On Nature's bosom still in a half sleep\nl
And deepened with hues of lax and mellow ease\nl
The tranquil beauty of the waning year.\nl
Then Spring, an ardent lover, leaped through leaves\nl
And caught the earth-bride in his eager clasp;\nl
His advent was a fire of irised hues,\nl
His arms were a circle of the arrival of joy.\nl
His voice was a call to the Transcendent's sphere\nl
Whose secret touch upon our mortal lives\nl
Keeps ever new the thrill that made the world,\nl
Remoulds an ancient sweetness to new shapes\nl
And guards intact unchanged by death and Time\nl
The answer of our hearts to Nature's charm\nl
And keeps for ever new, yet still the same,\nl
The throb that ever wakes to the old delight\nl
Page 351

And beauty and rapture and the joy to live.\nl
His coming brought the magic and the spell;\nl
At his touch life's tired heart grew glad and young;\nl
He made joy a willing prisoner in her breast.\nl
His grasp was a young god's upon earth's limbs:\nl
Changed by the passion of his divine outbreak\nl
He made her body beautiful with his kiss.\nl
Impatient for felicity he came,\nl
High-fluting with the co\"il's happy voice,\nl
His peacock turban trailing on the trees;\nl
His breath was a warm summons to delight,\nl
The dense voluptuous azure was his gaze.\nl
A soft celestial urge surprised the blood\nl
Rich with the instinct of God's sensuous joys;\nl
Revealed in beauty, a cadence was abroad\nl
Insistent on the rapture-thrill in life:\nl
Immortal movements touched the fleeting hours.\nl
A godlike packed intensity of sense\nl
Made it a passionate pleasure even to breathe;\nl
All sights and voices wove a single charm.\nl
The life of the enchanted globe became\nl
A storm of sweetness and of light and song,\nl
A revel of colour and of ecstasy,\nl
A hymn of rays, a litany of cries:\nl
A strain of choral priestly music sang\nl
And, swung on the swaying censer of the trees,\nl
A sacrifice of perfume filled the hours.\nl
Asocas burned in crimson spots of flame,\nl
Pure like the breath of an unstained desire\nl
White jasmines haunted the enamoured air,\nl
Pale mango-blossoms fed the liquid voice\nl
Of the love-maddened co\"il, and the brown bee\nl
Muttered in fragrance mid the honey-buds.\nl
The sunlight was a great god's golden smile.\nl
All Nature was at beauty's festival.\nl
Page 352

\spar In this high signal moment of the gods\nl
Answering earth's yearning and her cry for bliss,\nl
A greatness from our other countries came.\nl
A silence in the noise of earthly things\nl
Immutably revealed the secret Word,\nl
A mightier influx filled the oblivious clay:\nl
A lamp was lit, a sacred image made.\nl
A mediating ray had touched the earth\nl
Bridging the gulf between man's mind and God's;\nl
Its brightness linked our transience to the Unknown.\nl
A spirit of its celestial source aware\nl
Translating heaven into a human shape\nl
Descended into earth's imperfect mould\nl
And wept not fallen to mortality,\nl
But looked on all with large and tranquil eyes.\nl
One had returned from the transcendent planes\nl
And bore anew the load of mortal breath,\nl
Who had striven of old with our darkness and our pain;\nl
She took again her divine unfinished task:\nl
Survivor of death and the aeonic years,\nl
Once more with her fathomless heart she fronted Time.\nl
Again there was renewed, again revealed\nl
The ancient closeness by earth-vision veiled,\nl
The secret contact broken off in Time,\nl
A consanguinity of earth and heaven,\nl
Between the human portion toiling here\nl
And an as yet unborn and limitless Force.\nl
Again the mystic deep attempt began,\nl
The daring wager of the cosmic game.\nl
For since upon this blind and whirling globe\nl
Earth-plasm first quivered with the illumining mind\nl
And life invaded the material sheath\nl
Afflicting Inconscience with the need to feel,\nl
Since in Infinity's silence woke a word,\nl
A Mother-wisdom works in Nature's breast\nl
To pour delight on the heart of toil and want\nl
Page 353

And press perfection on life's stumbling powers,\nl
Impose heaven-sentience on the obscure abyss\nl
And make dumb Matter conscious of its God.\nl
Although our fallen minds forget to climb,\nl
Although our human stuff resists or breaks,\nl
She keeps her will that hopes to divinise clay;\nl
Failure cannot repress, defeat o'erthrow;\nl
Time cannot weary her nor the Void subdue,\nl
The ages have not made her passion less;\nl
No victory she admits of Death or Fate.\nl
Always she drives the soul to new attempt;\nl
Always her magical infinitude\nl
Forces to aspire the inert brute elements;\nl
As one who has all infinity to waste,\nl
She scatters the seed of the Eternal's strength\nl
On a half-animate and crumbling mould,\nl
Plants heaven's delight in the heart's passionate mire,\nl
Pours godhead's seekings into a bare beast frame,\nl
Hides immortality in a mask of death.\nl
Once more that Will put on an earthly shape.\nl
A Mind empowered from Truth's immutable seat\nl
Was framed for vision and interpreting act\nl
And instruments were sovereignly designed\nl
To express divinity in terrestrial signs.\nl
Outlined by the pressure of this new descent\nl
A lovelier body formed than earth had known.\nl
As yet a prophecy only and a hint,\nl
The glowing arc of a charmed unseen whole,\nl
It came into the sky of mortal life\nl
Bright like the crescent horn of a gold moon\nl
Returning in a faint illumined eve.\nl
At first glimmering like an unshaped idea\nl
Passive she lay sheltered in wordless sleep,\nl
Involved and drowned in Matter's giant trance,\nl
An infant heart of the deep-caved world-plan\nl
In cradle of divine inconscience rocked\nl
Page 354

By the universal ecstasy of the suns.\nl
Some missioned Power in the half-wakened frame\nl
Nursed a transcendent birth's dumb glorious seed\nl
For which this vivid tenement was made.\nl
But soon the link of soul with form grew sure;\nl
Flooded was the dim cave with slow conscient light,\nl
The seed grew into a delicate marvellous bud,\nl
The bud disclosed a great and heavenly bloom.\nl
At once she seemed to found a mightier race.\nl
Arrived upon the strange and dubious globe\nl
The child remembering inly a far home\nl
Lived guarded in her spirit's luminous cell,\nl
Alone mid men in her diviner kind.\nl
Even in her childish movements could be felt\nl
The nearness of a light still kept from earth,\nl
Feelings that only eternity could share,\nl
Thoughts natural and native to the gods.\nl
As needing nothing but its own rapt flight\nl
Her nature dwelt in a strong separate air\nl
Like a strange bird with large rich-coloured breast\nl
That sojourns on a secret fruited bough,\nl
Lost in the emerald glory of the woods\nl
Or flies above divine unreachable tops.\nl
Harmoniously she impressed the earth with heaven.\nl
Aligned to a swift rhythm of sheer delight\nl
And singing to themselves her days went by;\nl
Each minute was a throb of beauty's heart;\nl
The hours were tuned to a sweet-toned content\nl
Which asked for nothing, but took all life gave\nl
Sovereignly as her nature's inborn right.\nl
Near was her spirit to its parent Sun,\nl
The Breath within to the eternal joy.\nl
The first fair life that breaks from Nature's swoon,\nl
Mounts in a line of rapture to the skies;\nl
Absorbed in its own happy urge it lives,\nl
Sufficient to itself, yet turned to all:\nl
Page 355

It has no seen communion with its world,\nl
No open converse with surrounding things.\nl
There is a oneness native and occult\nl
That needs no instruments and erects no form;\nl
In unison it grows with all that is.\nl
All contacts it assumes into its trance,\nl
Laugh-tossed consents to the wind's kiss and takes\nl
Transmutingly the shocks of sun and breeze:\nl
A blissful yearning riots in its leaves,\nl
A magic passion trembles in its blooms,\nl
Its boughs aspire in hushed felicity.\nl
An occult godhead of this beauty is cause,\nl
The spirit and intimate guest of all this charm,\nl
This sweetness's priestess and this reverie's muse.\nl
Invisibly protected from our sense\nl
The Dryad lives drenched in a deeper ray\nl
And feels another air of storms and calms\nl
And quivers inwardly with mystic rain.\nl
This at a heavenlier height was shown in her.\nl
Even when she bent to meet earth's intimacies\nl
Her spirit kept the stature of the gods;\nl
It stooped but was not lost in Matter's reign.\nl
A world translated was her gleaming mind,\nl
And marvel-mooned bright crowding fantasies\nl
Fed with spiritual sustenance of dreams\nl
The ideal goddess in her house of gold.\nl
Aware of forms to which our eyes are closed,\nl
Conscious of nearnesses we cannot feel,\nl
The Power within her shaped her moulding sense\nl
In deeper figures than our surface types.\nl
An invisible sunlight ran within her veins\nl
And flooded her brain with heavenly brilliances\nl
That woke a wider sight than earth could know.\nl
Outlined in the sincerity of that ray\nl
Her springing childlike thoughts were richly turned\nl
Into luminous patterns of her soul's deep truth,\nl
Page 356

And from her eyes she cast another look\nl
On all around her than man's ignorant view.\nl
All objects were to her shapes of living selves\nl
And she perceived a message from her kin\nl
In each awakening touch of outward things.\nl
Each was a symbol power, a vivid flash\nl
In the circuit of infinities half-known;\nl
Nothing was alien or inanimate,\nl
Nothing without its meaning or its call.\nl
For with a greater Nature she was one.\nl
As from the soil sprang glory of branch and flower,\nl
As from the animal's life rose thinking man,\nl
A new epiphany appeared in her.\nl
A mind of light, a life of rhythmic force,\nl
A body instinct with hidden divinity\nl
Prepared an image of the coming god;\nl
And when the slow rhyme of the expanding years\nl
And the rich murmurous swarm-work of the days\nl
Had honey-packed her sense and filled her limbs,\nl
Accomplishing the moon-orb of her grace,\nl
Self-guarded in the silence of her strength\nl
Her solitary greatness was not less.\nl
Nearer the godhead to the surface pressed,\nl
A sun replacing childhood's nebula\nl
Sovereign in a blue and lonely sky.\nl
Upward it rose to grasp the human scene:\nl
The strong Inhabitant turned to watch her field.\nl
A lovelier light assumed her spirit brow\nl
And sweet and solemn grew her musing gaze;\nl
Celestial-human deep warm slumbrous fires\nl
Woke in the long fringed glory of her eyes\nl
Like altar-burnings in a mysteried shrine.\nl
Out of those crystal windows gleamed a will\nl
That brought a large significance to life.\nl
Holding her forehead's candid stainless space\nl
Behind the student arch a noble power\nl
Page 357

Of wisdom looked from light on transient things.\nl
A scout of victory in a vigil tower,\nl
Her aspiration called high destiny down;\nl
A silent warrior paced in her city of strength\nl
Inviolate, guarding Truth's diamond throne.\nl
A nectarous haloed moon her passionate heart\nl
Loved all and spoke no word and made no sign,\nl
But kept her bosom's rapturous secrecy\nl
A blissful ardent moved and voiceless world.\nl
Proud, swift and joyful ran the wave of life\nl
Within her like a stream in Paradise.\nl
Many high gods dwelt in one beautiful home;\nl
Yet was her nature's orb a perfect whole,\nl
Harmonious like a chant with many tones,\nl
Immense and various like a universe.\nl
The body that held this greatness seemed almost\nl
An image made of heaven's transparent light.\nl
Its charm recalled things seen in vision's hours,\nl
A golden bridge spanning a faery flood,\nl
A moon-touched palm-tree single by a lake\nl
Companion of the wide and glimmering peace,\nl
A murmur as of leaves in Paradise\nl
Moving when feet of the Immortals pass,\nl
A fiery halo over sleeping hills,\nl
A strange and starry head alone in Night.\nl

\ht Canto Two: The Growth of the Flame
\par
\sbigcap A land of mountains and wide sun-beat plains\nl
And giant rivers pacing to vast seas,\nl
A field of creation and spiritual hush,\nl
Silence swallowing life's acts into the deeps,\nl
Of thought's transcendent climb and heavenward leap,\nl
A brooding world of reverie and trance,\nl
Filled with the mightiest works of God and man,\nl
Where Nature seemed a dream of the Divine\nl
And beauty and grace and grandeur had their home,\nl
Harboured the childhood of the incarnate Flame.\nl
Over her watched millennial influences\nl
And the deep godheads of a grandiose past\nl
Looked on her and saw the future's godheads come\nl
As if this magnet drew their powers unseen.\nl
Earth's brooding wisdom spoke to her still breast;\nl
Mounting from mind's last peaks to mate with gods,\nl
Making earth's brilliant thoughts a springing-board\nl
To dive into the cosmic vastnesses,\nl
The knowledge of the thinker and the seer\nl
Saw the unseen and thought the unthinkable,\nl
Opened the enormous doors of the unknown,\nl
Rent man's horizons into infinity.\nl
A shoreless sweep was lent to the mortal's acts,\nl
And art and beauty sprang from the human depths;\nl
Nature and soul vied in nobility.\nl
Ethics the human keyed to imitate heaven;\nl
The harmony of a rich culture's tones\nl
Refined the sense and magnified its reach\nl
To hear the unheard and glimpse the invisible\nl
And taught the soul to soar beyond things known,\nl
Inspiring life to greaten and break its bounds,\nl
Page 359

Aspiring to the Immortals' unseen world.\nl
Leaving earth's safety daring wings of Mind\nl
Bore her above the trodden fields of thought\nl
Crossing the mystic seas of the Beyond\nl
To live on eagle heights near to the Sun.\nl
There Wisdom sits on her eternal throne.\nl
All her life's turns led her to symbol doors\nl
Admitting to secret Powers that were her kin;\nl
Adept of truth, initiate of bliss,\nl
A mystic acolyte trained in Nature's school,\nl
Aware of the marvel of created things\nl
She laid the secrecies of her heart's deep muse\nl
Upon the altar of the Wonderful;\nl
Her hours were a ritual in a timeless fane;\nl
Her acts became gestures of sacrifice.\nl
Invested with a rhythm of higher spheres\nl
The word was used as a hieratic means\nl
For the release of the imprisoned spirit\nl
Into communion with its comrade gods.\nl
Or it helped to beat out new expressive forms\nl
Of that which labours in the heart of life,\nl
Some immemorial Soul in men and things,\nl
Seeker of the unknown and the unborn\nl
Carrying a light from the Ineffable\nl
To rend the veil of the last mysteries.\nl
Intense philosophies pointed earth to heaven\nl
Or on foundations broad as cosmic Space\nl
Upraised the earth-mind to superhuman heights.\nl
Overpassing lines that please the outward eyes\nl
But hide the sight of that which lives within\nl
Sculpture and painting concentrated sense\nl
Upon an inner vision's motionless verge,\nl
Revealed a figure of the invisible,\nl
Unveiled all Nature's meaning in a form,\nl
Or caught into a body the Divine.\nl
The architecture of the Infinite\nl
Page 360

Discovered here its inward-musing shapes\nl
Captured into wide breadths of soaring stone:\nl
Music brought down celestial yearnings, song\nl
Held the merged heart absorbed in rapturous depths,\nl
Linking the human with the cosmic cry;\nl
The world-interpreting movements of the dance\nl
Moulded idea and mood to a rhythmic sway\nl
And posture; crafts minute in subtle lines\nl
Eternised a swift moment's memory\nl
Or showed in a carving's sweep, a cup's design\nl
The underlying patterns of the unseen:\nl
Poems in largeness cast like moving worlds\nl
And metres surging with the ocean's voice\nl
Translated by grandeurs locked in Nature's heart\nl
But thrown now into a crowded glory of speech\nl
The beauty and sublimity of her forms,\nl
The passion of her moments and her moods\nl
Lifting the human word nearer to the god's.\nl
Man's eyes could look into the inner realms;\nl
His scrutiny discovered number's law\nl
And organised the motions of the stars,\nl
Mapped out the visible fashioning of the world,\nl
Questioned the process of his thoughts or made\nl
A theorised diagram of mind and life.\nl
These things she took in as her nature's food,\nl
But these alone could fill not her wide Self:\nl
A human seeking limited by its gains,\nl
To her they seemed the great and early steps\nl
Hazardous of a young discovering spirit\nl
Which saw not yet by its own native light;\nl
It tapped the universe with testing knocks\nl
Or stretched to find truth mind's divining rod;\nl
There was a growing out to numberless sides,\nl
But not the widest seeing of the soul,\nl
Not yet the vast direct immediate touch,\nl
Nor yet the art and wisdom of the Gods.\nl
Page 361

A boundless knowledge greater than man's thought,\nl
A happiness too high for heart and sense\nl
Locked in the world and yearning for release\nl
She felt in her; waiting as yet for form,\nl
It asked for objects around which to grow\nl
And natures strong to bear without recoil\nl
The splendour of her native royalty,\nl
Her greatness and her sweetness and her bliss,\nl
Her might to possess and her vast power to love:\nl
Earth made a stepping-stone to conquer heaven,\nl
The soul saw beyond heaven's limiting boundaries,\nl
Met a great light from the Unknowable\nl
And dreamed of a transcendent action's sphere.\nl
Aware of the universal Self in all\nl
She turned to living hearts and human forms,\nl
Her soul's reflections, complements, counterparts,\nl
The close outlying portions of her being\nl
Divided from her by walls of body and mind\nl
Yet to her spirit bound by ties divine.\nl
Overcoming invisible hedge and masked defence\nl
And the loneliness that separates soul from soul,\nl
She wished to make all one immense embrace\nl
That she might house in it all living things\nl
Raised into a splendid point of seeing light\nl
Out of division's dense inconscient cleft,\nl
And make them one with God and world and her.\nl
Only a few responded to her call:\nl
Still fewer felt the screened divinity\nl
And strove to mate its godhead with their own,\nl
Approaching with some kinship to her heights.\nl
Uplifted towards luminous secrecies\nl
Or conscious of some splendour hidden above\nl
They leaped to find her in a moment's flash,\nl
Glimpsing a light in a celestial vast,\nl
But could not keep the vision and the power\nl
And fell back to life's dull ordinary tone.\nl
Page 362

A mind daring heavenly experiment,\nl
Growing towards some largeness they felt near,\nl
Testing the unknown's bound with eager touch\nl
They still were prisoned by their human grain:\nl
They could not keep up with her tireless step;\nl
Too small and eager for her large-paced will,\nl
Too narrow to look with the unborn Infinite's gaze\nl
Their nature weary grew of things too great.\nl
For even the close partners of her thoughts\nl
Who could have walked the nearest to her ray,\nl
Worshipped the power and light they felt in her\nl
But could not match the measure of her soul.\nl
A friend and yet too great wholly to know,\nl
She walked in their front towards a greater light,\nl
Their leader and queen over their hearts and souls,\nl
One close to their bosoms, yet divine and far.\nl
Admiring and amazed they saw her stride\nl
Attempting with a godlike rush and leap\nl
Heights for their human stature too remote\nl
Or with a slow great many-sided toil\nl
Pushing towards aims they hardly could conceive;\nl
Yet forced to be the satellites of her sun\nl
They moved unable to forego her light,\nl
Desiring they clutched at her with outstretched hands\nl
Or followed stumbling in the paths she made.\nl
Or longing with their self of life and flesh\nl
They clung to her for heart's nourishment and support:\nl
The rest they could not see in visible light;\nl
Vaguely they bore her inner mightiness.\nl
Or bound by the senses and the longing heart,\nl
Adoring with a turbid human love,\nl
They could not grasp the mighty spirit she was\nl
Or change by closeness to be even as she.\nl
Some felt her with their souls and thrilled with her,\nl
A greatness felt near yet beyond mind's grasp;\nl
To see her was a summons to adore,\nl
Page 363

To be near her drew a high communion's force.\nl
So men worship a god too great to know,\nl
Too high, too vast to wear a limiting shape;\nl
They feel a Presence and obey a might,\nl
Adore a love whose rapture invades their breasts;\nl
To a divine ardour quickening the heart-beats,\nl
A law they follow greatening heart and life.\nl
Opened to the breath is a new diviner air,\nl
Opened to man is a freer, happier world:\nl
He sees high steps climbing to Self and Light.\nl
Her divine parts the soul's allegiance called:\nl
It saw, it felt, it knew the deity.\nl
Her will was puissant on their nature's acts,\nl
Her heart's inexhaustible sweetness lured their hearts,\nl
A being they loved whose bounds exceeded theirs;\nl
Her measure they could not reach but bore her touch,\nl
Answering with the flower's answer to the sun\nl
They gave themselves to her and asked no more.\nl
One greater than themselves, too wide for their ken,\nl
Their minds could not understand nor wholly know,\nl
Their lives replied to hers, moved at her words:\nl
They felt a godhead and obeyed a call,\nl
Answered to her lead and did her work in the world;\nl
Their lives, their natures moved compelled by hers\nl
As if the truth of their own larger selves\nl
Put on an aspect of divinity\nl
To exalt them to a pitch beyond their earth's.\nl
They felt a larger future meet their walk;\nl
She held their hands, she chose for them their paths:\nl
They were moved by her towards great unknown things,\nl
Faith drew them and the joy to feel themselves hers;\nl
They lived in her, they saw the world with her eyes.\nl
Some turned to her against their nature's bent;\nl
Divided between wonder and revolt,\nl
Drawn by her charm and mastered by her will,\nl
Possessed by her, her striving to possess,\nl
Page 364

Impatient subjects, their tied longing hearts\nl
Hugging the bonds close of which they most complained,\nl
Murmured at a yoke they would have wept to lose,\nl
The splendid yoke of her beauty and her love:\nl
Others pursued her with life's blind desires\nl
And claiming all of her as their lonely own,\nl
Hastened to engross her sweetness meant for all.\nl
As earth claims light for its lone separate need\nl
Demanding her for their sole jealous clasp,\nl
They asked from her movements bounded like their own\nl
And to their smallness craved a like response.\nl
Or they repined that she surpassed their grip,\nl
And hoped to bind her close with longing's cords.\nl
Or finding her touch desired too strong to bear\nl
They blamed her for a tyranny they loved,\nl
Shrank into themselves as from too bright a sun,\nl
Yet hankered for the splendour they refused.\nl
Angrily enamoured of her sweet passionate ray\nl
The weakness of their earth could hardly bear,\nl
They longed but cried out at the touch desired\nl
Inapt to meet divinity so close,\nl
Intolerant of a Force they could not house.\nl
Some drawn unwillingly by her divine sway\nl
Endured it like a sweet but alien spell;\nl
Unable to mount to levels too sublime,\nl
They yearned to draw her down to their own earth.\nl
Or forced to centre round her their passionate lives,\nl
They hoped to bind to their heart's human needs\nl
Her glory and grace that had enslaved their souls.\nl

\spar But mid this world, these hearts that answered her call,\nl
None could stand up her equal and her mate.\nl
In vain she stooped to equal them with her heights,\nl
Too pure that air was for small souls to breathe.\nl
These comrade selves to raise to her own wide breadths\nl
Her heart desired and fill with her own power\nl
Page 365

That a diviner Force might enter life,\nl
A breath of Godhead greaten human time.\nl
Although she leaned down to their littleness\nl
Covering their lives with her strong passionate hands\nl
And knew by sympathy their needs and wants\nl
And dived in the shallow wave-depths of their lives\nl
And met and shared their heart-beats of grief and joy\nl
And bent to heal their sorrow and their pride,\nl
Lavishing the might that was hers on her lone peak\nl
To lift to it their aspiration's cry,\nl
And though she drew their souls into her vast\nl
And surrounded with the silence of her deeps\nl
And held as the great Mother holds her own,\nl
Only her earthly surface bore their charge\nl
And mixed its fire with their mortality:\nl
Her greater self lived sole, unclaimed, within.\nl
Oftener in dumb Nature's stir and peace\nl
A nearness she could feel serenely one;\nl
The Force in her drew earth's subhuman broods;\nl
And to her spirit's large and free delight\nl
She joined the ardent-hued magnificent lives\nl
Of animal and bird and flower and tree.\nl
They answered to her with the simple heart.\nl
In man a dim disturbing somewhat lives;\nl
It knows but turns away from divine Light\nl
Preferring the dark ignorance of the fall.\nl
Among the many who came drawn to her\nl
Nowhere she found her partner of high tasks,\nl
The comrade of her soul, her other self\nl
Who was made with her, like God and Nature, one.\nl
Some near approached, were touched, caught fire, then failed,\nl
Too great was her demand, too pure her force.\nl
Thus lighting earth around her like a sun,\nl
Yet in her inmost sky an orb aloof,\nl
A distance severed her from those most close.\nl
Puissant, apart her soul as the gods live.\nl
Page 366

\spar As yet unlinked with the broad human scene,\nl
In a small circle of young eager hearts,\nl
Her being's early school and closed domain,\nl
Apprentice in the business of earth-life,\nl
She schooled her heavenly strain to bear its touch,\nl
Content in her little garden of the gods\nl
As blooms a flower in an unvisited place.\nl
Earth nursed, unconscious still, the inhabiting flame,\nl
Yet something deeply stirred and dimly knew;\nl
There was a movement and a passionate call,\nl
A rainbow dream, a hope of golden change;\nl
Some secret wing of expectation beat,\nl
A growing sense of something new and rare\nl
And beautiful stole across the heart of Time.\nl
Then a faint whisper of her touched the soil,\nl
Breathed like a hidden need the soul divines;\nl
The eye of the great world discovered her\nl
And wonder lifted up its bardic voice.\nl
A key to a Light still kept in being's cave,\nl
The sun-word of an ancient mystery's sense,\nl
Her name ran murmuring on the lips of men\nl
Exalted and sweet like an inspired verse\nl
Struck from the epic lyre of rumour's winds\nl
Or sung like a chanted thought by the poet Fame.\nl
But like a sacred symbol's was that cult.\nl
Admired, unsought, intangible to the grasp\nl
Her beauty and flaming strength were seen afar\nl
Like lightning playing with the fallen day,\nl
A glory unapproachably divine.\nl
No equal heart came close to join her heart,\nl
No transient earthly love assailed her calm,\nl
No hero passion had the strength to seize;\nl
No eyes demanded her replying eyes.\nl
A Power within her awed the imperfect flesh;\nl
The self-protecting genius in our clay\nl
Divined the goddess in the woman's shape\nl
Page 367

And drew back from a touch beyond its kind\nl
The earth-nature bound in sense-life's narrow make.\nl
The hearts of men are amorous of clay-kin\nl
And bear not spirits lone and high who bring\nl
Fire-intimations from the deathless planes\nl
Too vast for souls not born to mate with heaven.\nl
Whoever is too great must lonely live.\nl
Adored he walks in mighty solitude;\nl
Vain is his labour to create his kind,\nl
His only comrade is the Strength within.\nl
Thus was it for a while with Savitri.\nl
All worshipped marvellingly, none dared to claim.\nl
Her mind sat high pouring its golden beams,\nl
Her heart was a crowded temple of delight.\nl
A single lamp lit in perfection's house,\nl
A bright pure image in a priestless shrine,\nl
Midst those encircling lives her spirit dwelt,\nl
Apart in herself until her hour of fate.\nl

\par
\sbigcap A morn that seemed a new creation's front,\nl
Bringing a greater sunlight, happier skies,\nl
Came burdened with a beauty moved and strange\nl
Out of the changeless origin of things.\nl
An ancient longing struck again new roots:\nl
The air drank deep of unfulfilled desire;\nl
The high trees trembled with a wandering wind\nl
Like souls that quiver at the approach of joy,\nl
And in a bosom of green secrecy\nl
For ever of its one love-note untired\nl
A lyric co\"il cried among the leaves.\nl
Away from the terrestrial murmur turned\nl
Where transient calls and answers mix their flood,\nl
King Aswapati listened through the ray\nl
To other sounds than meet the sense-formed ear.\nl
On a subtle interspace which rings our life,\nl
Unlocked were the inner spirit's trance-closed doors:\nl
The inaudible strain in Nature could be caught;\nl
Across this cyclic tramp of eager lives,\nl
Across the deep urgency of present cares,\nl
Earth's wordless hymn to the Ineffable\nl
Arose from the silent heart of the cosmic Void;\nl
He heard the voice repressed of unborn Powers\nl
Murmuring behind the luminous bars of Time.\nl
Again the mighty yearning raised its flame\nl
That asks a perfect life on earth for men\nl
And prays for certainty in the uncertain mind\nl
And shadowless bliss for suffering human hearts\nl
And Truth embodied in an ignorant world\nl
And godhead divinising mortal forms.\nl
A word that leaped from some far sky of thought,\nl
Page 369

Admitted by the cowled receiving scribe\nl
Traversed the echoing passages of his brain\nl
And left its stamp on the recording cells.\nl
“O Force-compelled, Fate-driven earth-born race,\nl
O petty adventurers in an infinite world\nl
And prisoners of a dwarf humanity,\nl
How long will you tread the circling tracks of mind\nl
Around your little self and petty things?\nl
But not for a changeless littleness were you meant,\nl
Not for vain repetition were you built;\nl
Out of the Immortal's substance you were made;\nl
Your actions can be swift revealing steps,\nl
Your life a changeful mould for growing gods.\nl
A Seer, a strong Creator, is within,\nl
The immaculate Grandeur broods upon your days,\nl
Almighty powers are shut in Nature's cells.\nl
A greater destiny waits you in your front:\nl
This transient earthly being if he wills\nl
Can fit his acts to a transcendent scheme.\nl
He who now stares at the world with ignorant eyes\nl
Hardly from the Inconscient's night aroused,\nl
That look at images and not at Truth,\nl
Can fill those orbs with an immortal's sight.\nl
Yet shall the godhead grow within your hearts,\nl
You shall awake into the spirit's air\nl
And feel the breaking walls of mortal mind\nl
And hear the message which left life's heart dumb\nl
And look through Nature with sun-gazing lids\nl
And blow your conch-shells at the Eternal's gate.\nl
Authors of earth's high change, to you it is given\nl
To cross the dangerous spaces of the soul\nl
And touch the mighty Mother stark awake\nl
And meet the Omnipotent in this house of flesh\nl
And make of life the million-bodied One.\nl
The earth you tread is a border screened from heaven;\nl
The life you lead conceals the light you are.\nl
Page 370

Immortal Powers sweep flaming past your doors;\nl
Far-off upon your tops the god-chant sounds\nl
While to exceed yourselves thought's trumpets call,\nl
Heard by a few, but fewer dare aspire,\nl
The nympholepts of the ecstasy and the blaze.\nl
An epic of hope and failure breaks earth's heart;\nl
Her force and will exceed her form and fate.\nl
A goddess in a net of transience caught,\nl
Self-bound in the pastures of death she dreams of life,\nl
Self-racked with the pains of hell aspires to joy,\nl
And builds to hope her altars of despair,\nl
Knows that one high step might enfranchise all\nl
And, suffering, looks for greatness in her sons.\nl
But dim in human hearts the ascending fire,\nl
The invisible Grandeur sits unworshipped there;\nl
Man sees the Highest in a limiting form\nl
Or looks upon a Person, hears a Name.\nl
He turns for little gains to ignorant Powers\nl
Or kindles his altar lights to a demon face.\nl
He loves the Ignorance fathering his pain.\nl
A spell is laid upon his glorious strengths;\nl
He has lost the inner Voice that led his thoughts,\nl
And masking the oracular tripod seat\nl
A specious Idol fills the marvel shrine.\nl
The great Illusion wraps him in its veils,\nl
The soul's deep intimations come in vain,\nl
In vain is the unending line of seers,\nl
The sages ponder in unsubstantial light,\nl
The poets lend their voice to outward dreams,\nl
A homeless fire inspires the prophet tongues.\nl
Heaven's flaming lights descend and back return,\nl
The luminous Eye approaches and retires;\nl
Eternity speaks, none understands its word;\nl
Fate is unwilling and the Abyss denies;\nl
The Inconscient's mindless waters block all done.\nl
Only a little lifted is Mind's screen;\nl
Page 371

The Wise who know see but one half of Truth,\nl
The strong climb hardly to a low-peaked height,\nl
The hearts that yearn are given one hour to love.\nl
His tale half told, falters the secret Bard;\nl
The gods are still too few in mortal forms.”\nl
The Voice withdrew into its hidden skies.\nl
But like a shining answer from the gods\nl
Approached through sun-bright spaces Savitri.\nl
Advancing amid tall heaven-pillaring trees,\nl
Apparelled in her flickering-coloured robe\nl
She seemed, burning towards the eternal realms,\nl
A bright moved torch of incense and of flame\nl
That from the sky-roofed temple-soil of earth\nl
A pilgrim hand lifts in an invisible shrine.\nl
There came the gift of a revealing hour:\nl
He saw through depths that reinterpret all,\nl
Limited not now by the dull body's eyes,\nl
New-found through an arch of clear discovery,\nl
This intimation of the world's delight,\nl
This wonder of the divine Artist's make\nl
Carved like a nectar-cup for thirsty gods,\nl
This breathing Scripture of the Eternal's joy,\nl
This net of sweetness woven of aureate fire.\nl
Transformed the delicate image-face became\nl
A deeper Nature's self-revealing sign,\nl
A gold-leaf palimpsest of sacred births,\nl
A grave world-symbol chiselled out of life.\nl
Her brow, a copy of clear unstained heavens,\nl
Was meditation's pedestal and defence,\nl
The very room and smile of musing Space,\nl
Its brooding line infinity's symbol curve.\nl
Amid her tresses' cloudy multitude\nl
Her long eyes shadowed as by wings of Night\nl
Under that moon-gold forehead's dreaming breadth\nl
Were seas of love and thought that held the world;\nl
Marvelling at life and earth they saw truths far.\nl
Page 372

A deathless meaning filled her mortal limbs;\nl
As in a golden vase's poignant line\nl
They seemed to carry the rhythmic sob of bliss\nl
Of earth's mute adoration towards heaven\nl
Released in beauty's cry of living form\nl
Towards the perfection of eternal things.\nl
Transparent grown the ephemeral living dress\nl
Bared the expressive deity to his view.\nl
Escaped from surface sight and mortal sense\nl
The seizing harmony of its shapes became\nl
The strange significant icon of a Power\nl
Renewing its inscrutable descent\nl
Into a human figure of its works\nl
That stood out in life's bold abrupt relief\nl
On the soil of the evolving universe,\nl
A godhead sculptured on a wall of thought,\nl
Mirrored in the flowing hours and dimly shrined\nl
In Matter as in a cathedral cave.\nl
Annulled were the transient values of the mind,\nl
The body's sense renounced its earthly look;\nl
Immortal met immortal in their gaze.\nl
Awaked from the close spell of daily use\nl
That hides soul-truth with the outward form's disguise,\nl
He saw through the familiar cherished limbs\nl
The great and unknown spirit born his child.\nl
An impromptu from the deeper sight within,\nl
Thoughts rose in him that knew not their own scope.\nl
Then to those large and brooding depths whence Love\nl
Regarded him across the straits of mind,\nl
He spoke in sentences from the unseen Heights.\nl
For the hidden prompters of our speech sometimes\nl
Can use the formulas of a moment's mood\nl
To weigh unconscious lips with words from Fate:\nl
A casual passing phrase can change our life.\nl
“O spirit, traveller of eternity,\nl
Who cam'st from the immortal spaces here\nl
Page 373

Armed for the splendid hazard of thy life\nl
To set thy conquering foot on Chance and Time,\nl
The moon shut in her halo dreams like thee.\nl
A mighty Presence still defends thy frame.\nl
Perhaps the heavens guard thee for some great soul,\nl
Thy fate, thy work are kept somewhere afar.\nl
Thy spirit came not down a star alone.\nl
O living inscription of the beauty of love\nl
Missalled in aureate virginity,\nl
What message of heavenly strength and bliss in thee\nl
Is written with the Eternal's sun-white script,\nl
One shall discover and greaten with it his life\nl
To whom thou loosenest thy heart's jewelled strings.\nl
O rubies of silence, lips from which there stole\nl
Low laughter, music of tranquillity,\nl
Star-lustrous eyes awake in sweet large night\nl
And limbs like fine-linked poems made of gold\nl
Stanzaed to glimmering curves by artist gods,\nl
Depart where love and destiny call your charm.\nl
Venture through the deep world to find thy mate.\nl
For somewhere on the longing breast of earth,\nl
Thy unknown lover waits for thee the unknown.\nl
Thy soul has strength and needs no other guide\nl
Than One who burns within thy bosom's powers.\nl
There shall draw near to meet thy approaching steps\nl
The second self for whom thy nature asks,\nl
He who shall walk until thy body's end\nl
A close-bound traveller pacing with thy pace,\nl
The lyrist of thy soul's most intimate chords\nl
Who shall give voice to what in thee is mute.\nl
Then shall you grow like vibrant kindred harps,\nl
One in the beats of difference and delight,\nl
Responsive in divine and equal strains,\nl
Discovering new notes of the eternal theme.\nl
One force shall be your mover and your guide,\nl
One light shall be around you and within;\nl
Page 374

Hand in strong hand confront Heaven's question, life:\nl
Challenge the ordeal of the immense disguise.\nl
Ascend from Nature to divinity's heights;\nl
Face the high gods, crowned with felicity,\nl
Then meet a greater god, thy self beyond Time.”\nl
This word was seed of all the thing to be:\nl
A hand from some Greatness opened her heart's locked doors\nl
And showed the work for which her strength was born.\nl
As when the mantra sinks in Yoga's ear,\nl
Its message enters stirring the blind brain\nl
And keeps in the dim ignorant cells its sound;\nl
The hearer understands a form of words\nl
And, musing on the index thought it holds,\nl
He strives to read it with the labouring mind,\nl
But finds bright hints, not the embodied truth:\nl
Then, falling silent in himself to know\nl
He meets the deeper listening of his soul:\nl
The Word repeats itself in rhythmic strains:\nl
Thought, vision, feeling, sense, the body's self\nl
Are seized unutterably and he endures\nl
An ecstasy and an immortal change;\nl
He feels a Wideness and becomes a Power,\nl
All knowledge rushes on him like a sea:\nl
Transmuted by the white spiritual ray\nl
He walks in naked heavens of joy and calm,\nl
Sees the God-face and hears transcendent speech:\nl
An equal greatness in her life was sown.\nl
Accustomed scenes were now an ended play:\nl
Moving in muse amid familiar powers,\nl
Touched by new magnitudes and fiery signs,\nl
She turned to vastnesses not yet her own;\nl
Allured her heart throbbed to unknown sweetnesses;\nl
The secrets of an unseen world were close.\nl
The morn went up into a smiling sky;\nl
Cast from its sapphire pinnacle of trance\nl
Day sank into the burning gold of eve;\nl
Page 375

The moon floated, a luminous waif through heaven\nl
And sank below the oblivious edge of dream;\nl
Night lit the watch-fires of eternity.\nl
Then all went back into mind's secret caves;\nl
A darkness stooping on the heaven-bird's wings\nl
Sealed in her senses from external sight\nl
And opened the stupendous depths of sleep.\nl
When the pale dawn slipped through Night's shadowy guard,\nl
Vainly the new-born light desired her face;\nl
The palace woke to its own emptiness;\nl
The sovereign of its daily joys was far;\nl
Her moonbeam feet tinged not the lucent floors:\nl
The beauty and divinity were gone.\nl
Delight had fled to search the spacious world.\nl

\sbigcap The world-ways opened before Savitri.\nl
At first a strangeness of new brilliant scenes\nl
Peopled her mind and kept her body's gaze.\nl
But as she moved across the changing earth\nl
A deeper consciousness welled up in her:\nl
A citizen of many scenes and climes,\nl
Each soil and country it had made its home;\nl
It took all clans and peoples for her own,\nl
Till the whole destiny of mankind was hers.\nl
These unfamiliar spaces on her way\nl
Were known and neighbours to a sense within,\nl
Landscapes recurred like lost forgotten fields,\nl
Cities and rivers and plains her vision claimed\nl
Like slow-recurring memories in front,\nl
The stars at night were her past's brilliant friends,\nl
The winds murmured to her of ancient things\nl
And she met nameless comrades loved by her once.\nl
All was a part of old forgotten selves:\nl
Vaguely or with a flash of sudden hints\nl
Her acts recalled a line of bygone power,\nl
Even her motion's purpose was not new:\nl
Traveller to a prefigured high event,\nl
She seemed to her remembering witness soul\nl
To trace again a journey often made.\nl
A guidance turned the dumb revolving wheels\nl
And in the eager body of their speed\nl
The dim-masked hooded godheads rode who move\nl
Assigned to man immutably from his birth,\nl
Receivers of the inner and outer law,\nl
At once the agents of his spirit's will\nl
And witnesses and executors of his fate.\nl
Page 377

Inexorably faithful to their task,\nl
They hold his nature's sequence in their guard\nl
Carrying the unbroken thread old lives have spun.\nl
Attendants on his destiny's measured walk\nl
Leading to joys he has won and pains he has called,\nl
Even in his casual steps they intervene.\nl
Nothing we think or do is void or vain;\nl
Each is an energy loosed and holds its course.\nl
The shadowy keepers of our deathless past\nl
Have made our fate the child of our own acts,\nl
And from the furrows laboured by our will\nl
We reap the fruit of our forgotten deeds.\nl
But since unseen the tree that bore this fruit\nl
And we live in a present born from an unknown past,\nl
They seem but parts of a mechanic Force\nl
To a mechanic mind tied by earth's laws;\nl
Yet are they instruments of a Will supreme,\nl
Watched by a still all-seeing Eye above.\nl
A prescient architect of Fate and Chance\nl
Who builds our lives on a foreseen design\nl
The meaning knows and consequence of each step\nl
And watches the inferior stumbling powers.\nl
Upon her silent heights she was aware\nl
Of a calm Presence throned above her brows\nl
Who saw the goal and chose each fateful curve;\nl
It used the body for its pedestal;\nl
The eyes that wandered were its searchlight fires,\nl
The hands that held the reins its living tools;\nl
All was the working of an ancient plan,\nl
A way proposed by an unerring Guide.\nl
Across wide noons and glowing afternoons,\nl
She met with Nature and with human forms\nl
And listened to the voices of the world;\nl
Driven from within she followed her long road,\nl
Mute in the luminous cavern of her heart,\nl
Like a bright cloud through the resplendent day.\nl
Page 378

At first her path ran far through peopled tracts:\nl
Admitted to the lion eye of States\nl
And theatres of the loud act of man,\nl
Her carven chariot with its fretted wheels\nl
Threaded through clamorous marts and sentinel towers\nl
Past figured gates and high dream-sculptured fronts\nl
And gardens hung in the sapphire of the skies,\nl
Pillared assembly halls with armoured guards,\nl
Small fanes where one calm Image watched man's life\nl
And temples hewn as if by exiled gods\nl
To imitate their lost eternity.\nl
Often from gilded dusk to argent dawn,\nl
Where jewel-lamps flickered on frescoed walls\nl
And the stone lattice stared at moonlit boughs,\nl
Half-conscious of the tardy listening night\nl
Dimly she glided between banks of sleep\nl
At rest in the slumbering palaces of kings.\nl
Hamlet and village saw the fate-wain pass,\nl
Homes of a life bent to the soil it ploughs\nl
For sustenance of its short and passing days\nl
That, transient, keep their old repeated course,\nl
Unchanging in the circle of a sky\nl
Which alters not above our mortal toil.\nl
Away from this thinking creature's burdened hours\nl
To free and griefless spaces now she turned\nl
Not yet perturbed by human joys and fears.\nl
Here was the childhood of primaeval earth,\nl
Here timeless musings large and glad and still,\nl
Men had forborne as yet to fill with cares,\nl
Imperial acres of the eternal sower\nl
And wind-stirred grass-lands winking in the sun:\nl
Or mid green musing of woods and rough-browed hills,\nl
In the grove's murmurous bee-air humming wild\nl
Or past the long lapsing voice of silver floods\nl
Like a swift hope journeying among its dreams\nl
Hastened the chariot of the golden bride.\nl
Page 379

Out of the world's immense unhuman past\nl
Tract-memories and ageless remnants came,\nl
Domains of light enfeoffed to antique calm\nl
Listened to the unaccustomed sound of hooves\nl
And large immune entangled silences\nl
Absorbed her into emerald secrecy\nl
And slow hushed wizard nets of fiery bloom\nl
Environed with their coloured snare her wheels.\nl
The strong importunate feet of Time fell soft\nl
Along these lonely ways, his titan pace\nl
Forgotten and his stark and ruinous rounds.\nl
The inner ear that listens to solitude,\nl
Leaning self-rapt unboundedly could hear\nl
The rhythm of the intenser wordless Thought\nl
That gathers in the silence behind life,\nl
And the low sweet inarticulate voice of earth\nl
In the great passion of her sun-kissed trance\nl
Ascended with its yearning undertone.\nl
Afar from the brute noise of clamorous needs\nl
The quieted all-seeking mind could feel,\nl
At rest from its blind outwardness of will,\nl
The unwearied clasp of her mute patient love\nl
And know for a soul the mother of our forms.\nl
This spirit stumbling in the fields of sense,\nl
This creature bruised in the mortar of the days\nl
Could find in her broad spaces of release.\nl
Not yet was a world all occupied by care.\nl
The bosom of our mother kept for us still\nl
Her austere regions and her musing depths,\nl
Her impersonal reaches lonely and inspired\nl
And the mightinesses of her rapture haunts.\nl
Muse-lipped she nursed her symbol mysteries\nl
And guarded for her pure-eyed sacraments\nl
The valley clefts between her breasts of joy,\nl
Her mountain altars for the fires of dawn\nl
And nuptial beaches where the ocean couched\nl
Page 380

And the huge chanting of her prophet woods.\nl
Fields had she of her solitary mirth,\nl
Plains hushed and happy in the embrace of light,\nl
Alone with the cry of birds and hue of flowers,\nl
And wildernesses of wonder lit by her moons\nl
And grey seer-evenings kindling with the stars\nl
And dim movement in the night's infinitude.\nl
August, exulting in her Maker's eye,\nl
She felt her nearness to him in earth's breast,\nl
Conversed still with a Light behind the veil,\nl
Still communed with Eternity beyond.\nl
A few and fit inhabitants she called\nl
To share the glad communion of her peace;\nl
The breadth, the summit were their natural home.\nl
The strong king-sages from their labour done,\nl
Freed from the warrior tension of their task,\nl
Came to her serene sessions in these wilds;\nl
The strife was over, the respite lay in front.\nl
Happy they lived with birds and beasts and flowers\nl
And sunlight and the rustle of the leaves,\nl
And heard the wild winds wandering in the night,\nl
Mused with the stars in their mute constant ranks,\nl
And lodged in the mornings as in azure tents,\nl
And with the glory of the noons were one.\nl
Some deeper plunged; from life's external clasp\nl
Beckoned into a fiery privacy\nl
In the soul's unprofaned star-white recess\nl
They sojourned with an everliving Bliss;\nl
A Voice profound in the ecstasy and the hush\nl
They heard, beheld an all-revealing Light.\nl
All time-made difference they overcame;\nl
The world was fibred with their own heart-strings;\nl
Close drawn to the heart that beats in every breast,\nl
They reached the one self in all through boundless love.\nl
Attuned to Silence and to the world-rhyme,\nl
They loosened the knot of the imprisoning mind;\nl
Page 381

Achieved was the wide untroubled witness gaze,\nl
Unsealed was Nature's great spiritual eye;\nl
To the height of heights rose now their daily climb:\nl
Truth leaned to them from her supernal realm;\nl
Above them blazed eternity's mystic suns.\nl
Nameless the austere ascetics without home\nl
Abandoning speech and motion and desire\nl
Aloof from creatures sat absorbed, alone,\nl
Immaculate in tranquil heights of self\nl
On concentration's luminous voiceless peaks,\nl
World-naked hermits with their matted hair\nl
Immobile as the passionless great hills\nl
Around them grouped like thoughts of some vast mood\nl
Awaiting the Infinite's behest to end.\nl
The seers attuned to the universal Will,\nl
Content in Him who smiles behind earth's forms,\nl
Abode ungrieved by the insistent days.\nl
About them like green trees girdling a hill\nl
Young grave disciples fashioned by their touch,\nl
Trained to the simple act and conscious word,\nl
Greatened within and grew to meet their heights.\nl
Far-wandering seekers on the Eternal's path\nl
Brought to these quiet founts their spirit's thirst\nl
And spent the treasure of a silent hour\nl
Bathed in the purity of the mild gaze\nl
That, uninsistent, ruled them from its peace,\nl
And by its influence found the ways of calm.\nl
The Infants of the monarchy of the worlds,\nl
The heroic leaders of a coming time,\nl
King-children nurtured in that spacious air\nl
Like lions gambolling in sky and sun\nl
Received half-consciously their godlike stamp:\nl
Formed in the type of the high thoughts they sang\nl
They learned the wide magnificence of mood\nl
That makes us comrades of the cosmic urge,\nl
No longer chained to their small separate selves,\nl
Page 382

Plastic and firm beneath the eternal hand,\nl
Met Nature with a bold and friendly clasp\nl
And served in her the Power that shapes her works.\nl
One-souled to all and free from narrowing bonds,\nl
Large like a continent of warm sunshine\nl
In wide equality's impartial joy,\nl
These sages breathed for God's delight in things.\nl
Assisting the slow entries of the gods,\nl
Sowing in young minds immortal thoughts they lived,\nl
Taught the great Truth to which man's race must rise\nl
Or opened the gates of freedom to a few.\nl
Imparting to our struggling world the Light\nl
They breathed like spirits from Time's dull yoke released,\nl
Comrades and vessels of the cosmic Force,\nl
Using a natural mastery like the sun's:\nl
Their speech, their silence was a help to earth.\nl
A magic happiness flowed from their touch;\nl
Oneness was sovereign in that sylvan peace,\nl
The wild beast joined in friendship with its prey;\nl
Persuading the hatred and the strife to cease\nl
The love that flows from the one Mother's breast\nl
Healed with their hearts the hard and wounded world.\nl
Others escaped from the confines of thought\nl
To where Mind motionless sleeps waiting Light's birth,\nl
And came back quivering with a nameless Force,\nl
Drunk with a wine of lightning in their cells;\nl
Intuitive knowledge leaping into speech,\nl
Seized, vibrant, kindling with the inspired word,\nl
Hearing the subtle voice that clothes the heavens,\nl
Carrying the splendour that has lit the suns,\nl
They sang Infinity's names and deathless powers\nl
In metres that reflect the moving worlds,\nl
Sight's sound-waves breaking from the soul's great deeps.\nl
Some lost to the person and his strip of thought\nl
In a motionless ocean of impersonal Power,\nl
Sat mighty, visioned with the Infinite's light,\nl
Page 383

Or, comrades of the everlasting Will,\nl
Surveyed the plan of past and future Time.\nl
Some winged like birds out of the cosmic sea\nl
And vanished into a bright and featureless Vast:\nl
Some silent watched the universal dance,\nl
Or helped the world by world-indifference.\nl
Some watched no more merged in a lonely Self,\nl
Absorbed in the trance from which no soul returns,\nl
All the occult world-lines for ever closed,\nl
The chains of birth and person cast away:\nl
Some uncompanioned reached the Ineffable.\nl

\spar As floats a sunbeam through a shady place,\nl
The golden virgin in her carven car\nl
Came gliding among meditation's seats.\nl
Often in twilight mid returning troops\nl
Of cattle thickening with their dust the shades\nl
When the loud day had slipped below the verge,\nl
Arriving in a peaceful hermit grove\nl
She rested drawing round her like a cloak\nl
Its spirit of patient muse and potent prayer.\nl
Or near to a lion river's tawny mane\nl
And trees that worshipped on a praying shore,\nl
A domed and templed air's serene repose\nl
Beckoned to her hurrying wheels to stay their speed.\nl
In the solemnity of a space that seemed\nl
A mind remembering ancient silences,\nl
Where to the heart great bygone voices called\nl
And the large liberty of brooding seers\nl
Had left the long impress of their soul's scene,\nl
Awake in candid dawn or darkness mooned,\nl
To the still touch inclined the daughter of Flame\nl
Drank in hushed splendour between tranquil lids\nl
And felt the kinship of eternal calm.\nl
But morn broke in reminding her of her quest\nl
And from low rustic couch or mat she rose\nl
Page 384

And went impelled on her unfinished way\nl
And followed the fateful orbit of her life\nl
Like a desire that questions silent gods\nl
Then passes starlike to some bright Beyond.\nl
Thence to great solitary tracts she came,\nl
Where man was a passer-by towards human scenes\nl
Or sole in Nature's vastness strove to live\nl
And called for help to ensouled invisible Powers,\nl
Overwhelmed by the immensity of his world\nl
And unaware of his own infinity.\nl
The earth multiplied to her a changing brow\nl
And called her with a far and nameless voice.\nl
The mountains in their anchorite solitude,\nl
The forests with their multitudinous chant\nl
Disclosed to her the masked divinity's doors.\nl
On dreaming plains, an indolent expanse,\nl
The death-bed of a pale enchanted eve\nl
Under the glamour of a sunken sky,\nl
Impassive she lay as at an age's end,\nl
Or crossed an eager pack of huddled hills\nl
Lifting their heads to hunt a lairlike sky,\nl
Or travelled in a strange and empty land\nl
Where desolate summits camped in a weird heaven,\nl
Mute sentinels beneath a drifting moon,\nl
Or wandered in some lone tremendous wood\nl
Ringing for ever with the crickets' cry\nl
Or followed a long glistening serpent road\nl
Through fields and pastures lapped in moveless light\nl
Or reached the wild beauty of a desert space\nl
Where never plough was driven nor herd had grazed\nl
And slumbered upon stripped and thirsty sands\nl
Amid the savage wild-beast night's appeal.\nl
Still unaccomplished was the fateful quest;\nl
Still she found not the one predestined face\nl
For which she sought amid the sons of men.\nl
A grandiose silence wrapped the regal day:\nl
Page 385

The months had fed the passion of the sun\nl
And now his burning breath assailed the soil.\nl
The tiger heats prowled through the fainting earth;\nl
All was licked up as by a lolling tongue.\nl
The spring winds failed; the sky was set like bronze.\nl

\sbigcap But now the destined spot and hour were close;\nl
Unknowing she had neared her nameless goal.\nl
For though a dress of blind and devious chance\nl
Is laid upon the work of all-wise Fate,\nl
Our acts interpret an omniscient Force\nl
That dwells in the compelling stuff of things,\nl
And nothing happens in the cosmic play\nl
But at its time and in its foreseen place.\nl
To a space she came of soft and delicate air\nl
That seemed a sanctuary of youth and joy,\nl
A highland world of free and green delight\nl
Where spring and summer lay together and strove\nl
In indolent and amicable debate,\nl
Inarmed, disputing with laughter who should rule.\nl
There expectation beat wide sudden wings\nl
As if a soul had looked out from earth's face,\nl
And all that was in her felt a coming change\nl
And forgetting obvious joys and common dreams,\nl
Obedient to Time's call, to the spirit's fate,\nl
Was lifted to a beauty calm and pure\nl
That lived under the eyes of Eternity.\nl
A crowd of mountainous heads assailed the sky\nl
Pushing towards rival shoulders nearer heaven,\nl
The armoured leaders of an iron line;\nl
Earth prostrate lay beneath their feet of stone.\nl
Below them crouched a dream of emerald woods\nl
And gleaming borders solitary as sleep:\nl
Pale waters ran like glimmering threads of pearl.\nl
A sigh was straying among happy leaves;\nl
Cool-perfumed with slow pleasure-burdened feet\nl
Faint stumbling breezes faltered among flowers.\nl
Page 389

The white crane stood, a vivid motionless streak,\nl
Peacock and parrot jewelled soil and tree,\nl
The dove's soft moan enriched the enamoured air\nl
And fire-winged wild-drakes swam in silvery pools.\nl
Earth couched alone with her great lover Heaven,\nl
Uncovered to her consort's azure eye.\nl
In a luxurious ecstasy of joy\nl
She squandered the love-music of her notes,\nl
Wasting the passionate pattern of her blooms\nl
And festival riot of her scents and hues.\nl
A cry and leap and hurry was around,\nl
The stealthy footfalls of her chasing things,\nl
The shaggy emerald of her centaur mane,\nl
The gold and sapphire of her warmth and blaze.\nl
Magician of her rapt felicities,\nl
Blithe, sensuous-hearted, careless and divine,\nl
Life ran or hid in her delightful rooms;\nl
Behind all brooded Nature's grandiose calm.\nl
Primaeval peace was there and in its bosom\nl
Held undisturbed the strife of bird and beast.\nl
Man the deep-browed artificer had not come\nl
To lay his hand on happy inconscient things,\nl
Thought was not there nor the measurer, strong-eyed toil,\nl
Life had not learned its discord with its aim.\nl
The Mighty Mother lay outstretched at ease.\nl
All was in line with her first satisfied plan;\nl
Moved by a universal will of joy\nl
The trees bloomed in their green felicity\nl
And the wild children brooded not on pain.\nl
At the end reclined a stern and giant tract\nl
Of tangled depths and solemn questioning hills,\nl
Peaks like a bare austerity of the soul,\nl
Armoured, remote and desolately grand\nl
Like the thought-screened infinities that lie\nl
Behind the rapt smile of the Almighty's dance.\nl
A matted forest-head invaded heaven\nl
Page 390

As if a blue-throated ascetic peered\nl
From the stone fastness of his mountain cell\nl
Regarding the brief gladness of the days;\nl
His vast extended spirit couched behind.\nl
A mighty murmur of immense retreat\nl
Besieged the ear, a sad and limitless call\nl
As of a soul retiring from the world.\nl
This was the scene which the ambiguous Mother\nl
Had chosen for her brief felicitous hour;\nl
Here in this solitude far from the world\nl
Her part she began in the world's joy and strife.\nl
Here were disclosed to her the mystic courts,\nl
The lurking doors of beauty and surprise,\nl
The wings that murmur in the golden house,\nl
The temple of sweetness and the fiery aisle.\nl
A stranger on the sorrowful roads of Time,\nl
Immortal under the yoke of death and fate,\nl
A sacrificant of the bliss and pain of the spheres,\nl
Love in the wilderness met Savitri.\nl

\sbigcap All she remembered on this day of Fate,\nl
The road that hazarded not the solemn depths\nl
But turned away to flee to human homes,\nl
The wilderness with its mighty monotone,\nl
The morning like a lustrous seer above,\nl
The passion of the summits lost in heaven,\nl
The titan murmur of the endless woods.\nl
As if a wicket gate to joy were there\nl
Ringed in with voiceless hint and magic sign,\nl
Upon the margin of an unknown world\nl
Reclined the curve of a sun-held recess;\nl
Groves with strange flowers like eyes of gazing nymphs\nl
Peered from their secrecy into open space,\nl
Boughs whispering to a constancy of light\nl
Sheltered a dim and screened felicity,\nl
And slowly a supine inconstant breeze\nl
Ran like a fleeting sigh of happiness\nl
Over slumbrous grasses pranked with green and gold.\nl
Hidden in the forest's bosom of loneliness\nl
Amid the leaves the inmate voices called,\nl
Sweet like desires enamoured and unseen,\nl
Cry answering to low insistent cry.\nl
Behind slept emerald dumb remotenesses,\nl
Haunt of a Nature passionate, veiled, denied\nl
To all but her own vision lost and wild.\nl
Earth in this beautiful refuge free from cares\nl
Murmured to the soul a song of strength and peace.\nl
Only one sign was there of a human tread:\nl
A single path, shot thin and arrowlike\nl
Into this bosom of vast and secret life,\nl
Pierced its enormous dream of solitude.\nl
Page 392

Here first she met on the uncertain earth\nl
The one for whom her heart had come so far.\nl
As might a soul on Nature's background limned\nl
Stand out for a moment in a house of dream\nl
Created by the ardent breath of life,\nl
So he appeared against the forest verge\nl
Inset twixt green relief and golden ray.\nl
As if a weapon of the living Light,\nl
Erect and lofty like a spear of God\nl
His figure led the splendour of the morn.\nl
Noble and clear as the broad peaceful heavens\nl
A tablet of young wisdom was his brow;\nl
Freedom's imperious beauty curved his limbs,\nl
The joy of life was on his open face.\nl
His look was a wide daybreak of the gods,\nl
His head was a youthful Rishi's touched with light,\nl
His body was a lover's and a king's.\nl
In the magnificent dawning of his force\nl
Built like a moving statue of delight\nl
He illumined the border of the forest page.\nl
Out of the ignorant eager toil of the years\nl
Abandoning man's loud drama he had come\nl
Led by the wisdom of an adverse Fate\nl
To meet the ancient Mother in her groves.\nl
In her divine communion he had grown\nl
A foster-child of beauty and solitude,\nl
Heir to the centuries of the lonely wise,\nl
A brother of the sunshine and the sky,\nl
A wanderer communing with depth and marge.\nl
A Veda-knower of the unwritten book\nl
Perusing the mystic scripture of her forms,\nl
He had caught her hierophant significances,\nl
Her sphered immense imaginations learned,\nl
Taught by sublimities of stream and wood\nl
And voices of the sun and star and flame\nl
And chant of the magic singers on the boughs\nl
Page 393

And the dumb teaching of four-footed things.\nl
Helping with confident steps her slow great hands\nl
He leaned to her influence like a flower to rain\nl
And, like the flower and tree a natural growth,\nl
Widened with the touches of her shaping hours.\nl
The mastery free natures have was his\nl
And their assent to joy and spacious calm;\nl
One with the single Spirit inhabiting all,\nl
He laid experience at the Godhead's feet;\nl
His mind was open to her infinite mind,\nl
His acts were rhythmic with her primal force;\nl
He had subdued his mortal thought to hers.\nl
That day he had turned from his accustomed paths;\nl
For One who, knowing every moment's load,\nl
Can move in all our studied or careless steps,\nl
Had laid the spell of destiny on his feet\nl
And drawn him to the forest's flowering verge.\nl
\sparn At first her glance that took life's million shapes\nl
Impartially to people its treasure-house\nl
Along with sky and flower and hill and star,\nl
Dwelt rather on the bright harmonious scene.\nl
It saw the green-gold of the slumbrous sward,\nl
The grasses quivering with the slow wind's tread,\nl
The branches haunted by the wild bird's call.\nl
Awake to Nature, vague as yet to life,\nl
The eager prisoner from the Infinite,\nl
The immortal wrestler in its mortal house,\nl
Its pride, power, passion of a striving God,\nl
It saw this image of veiled deity,\nl
This thinking master creature of the earth,\nl
This last result of the beauty of the stars,\nl
But only saw like fair and common forms\nl
The artist spirit needs not for its work\nl
And puts aside in memory's shadowy rooms.\nl
A look, a turn decides our ill-poised fate.\nl
Thus in the hour that most concerned her all,\nl
Page 394

Wandering unwarned by the slow surface mind,\nl
The heedless scout beneath her tenting lids\nl
Admired indifferent beauty and cared not\nl
To wake her body's spirit to its king.\nl
So might she have passed by on chance ignorant roads\nl
Missing the call of Heaven, losing life's aim,\nl
But the god touched in time her conscious soul.\nl
Her vision settled, caught and all was changed.\nl
Her mind at first dwelt in ideal dreams,\nl
Those intimate transmuters of earth's signs\nl
That make known things a hint of unseen spheres,\nl
And saw in him the genius of the spot,\nl
A symbol figure standing mid earth's scenes,\nl
A king of life outlined in delicate air.\nl
Yet this was but a moment's reverie;\nl
For suddenly her heart looked out at him,\nl
The passionate seeing used thought cannot match,\nl
And knew one nearer than its own close strings.\nl
All in a moment was surprised and seized,\nl
All in inconscient ecstasy lain wrapped\nl
Or under imagination's coloured lids\nl
Held up in a large mirror-air of dream,\nl
Broke forth in flame to recreate the world,\nl
And in that flame to new things she was born.\nl
A mystic tumult from her depths arose;\nl
Haled, smitten erect like one who dreamed at ease,\nl
Life ran to gaze from every gate of sense:\nl
Thoughts indistinct and glad in moon-mist heavens,\nl
Feelings as when a universe takes birth,\nl
Swept through the turmoil of her bosom's space\nl
Invaded by a swarm of golden gods:\nl
Arising to a hymn of wonder's priests\nl
Her soul flung wide its doors to this new sun.\nl
An alchemy worked, the transmutation came;\nl
The missioned face had wrought the Master's spell.\nl
In the nameless light of two approaching eyes\nl
Page 395

A swift and fated turning of her days\nl
Appeared and stretched to a gleam of unknown worlds.\nl
Then trembling with the mystic shock her heart\nl
Moved in her breast and cried out like a bird\nl
Who hears his mate upon a neighbouring bough.\nl
Hooves trampling fast, wheels largely stumbling ceased;\nl
The chariot stood like an arrested wind.\nl
And Satyavan looked out from his soul's doors\nl
And felt the enchantment of her liquid voice\nl
Fill his youth's purple ambience and endured\nl
The haunting miracle of a perfect face.\nl
Mastered by the honey of a strange flower-mouth,\nl
Drawn to soul-spaces opening round a brow,\nl
He turned to the vision like a sea to the moon\nl
And suffered a dream of beauty and of change,\nl
Discovered the aureole round a mortal's head,\nl
Adored a new divinity in things.\nl
His self-bound nature foundered as in fire;\nl
His life was taken into another's life.\nl
The splendid lonely idols of his brain\nl
Fell prostrate from their bright sufficiencies,\nl
As at the touch of a new infinite,\nl
To worship a godhead greater than their own.\nl
An unknown imperious force drew him to her.\nl
Marvelling he came across the golden sward:\nl
Gaze met close gaze and clung in sight's embrace.\nl
A visage was there, noble and great and calm,\nl
As if encircled by a halo of thought,\nl
A span, an arch of meditating light,\nl
As though some secret nimbus half was seen;\nl
Her inner vision still remembering knew\nl
A forehead that wore the crown of all her past,\nl
Two eyes her constant and eternal stars,\nl
Comrade and sovereign eyes that claimed her soul,\nl
Lids known through many lives, large frames of love.\nl
He met in her regard his future's gaze,\nl
Page 396

A promise and a presence and a fire,\nl
Saw an embodiment of aeonic dreams,\nl
A mystery of the rapture for which all\nl
Yearns in this world of brief mortality\nl
Made in material shape his very own.\nl
This golden figure given to his grasp\nl
Hid in its breast the key of all his aims,\nl
A spell to bring the Immortal's bliss on earth,\nl
To mate with heaven's truth our mortal thought,\nl
To lift earth-hearts nearer the Eternal's sun.\nl
In these great spirits now incarnate here\nl
Love brought down power out of eternity\nl
To make of life his new undying base.\nl
His passion surged a wave from fathomless deeps;\nl
It leaped to earth from far forgotten heights,\nl
But kept its nature of infinity.\nl
On the dumb bosom of this oblivious globe\nl
Although as unknown beings we seem to meet,\nl
Our lives are not aliens nor as strangers join,\nl
Moved to each other by a causeless force.\nl
The soul can recognise its answering soul\nl
Across dividing Time and, on life's roads\nl
Absorbed wrapped traveller, turning it recovers\nl
Familiar splendours in an unknown face\nl
And touched by the warning finger of swift love\nl
It thrills again to an immortal joy\nl
Wearing a mortal body for delight.\nl
There is a Power within that knows beyond\nl
Our knowings; we are greater than our thoughts,\nl
And sometimes earth unveils that vision here.\nl
To live, to love are signs of infinite things,\nl
Love is a glory from eternity's spheres.\nl
Abased, disfigured, mocked by baser mights\nl
That steal his name and shape and ecstasy,\nl
He is still the godhead by which all can change.\nl
A mystery wakes in our inconscient stuff,\nl
Page 397

A bliss is born that can remake our life.\nl
Love dwells in us like an unopened flower\nl
Awaiting a rapid moment of the soul,\nl
Or he roams in his charmed sleep mid thoughts and things;\nl
The child-god is at play, he seeks himself\nl
In many hearts and minds and living forms:\nl
He lingers for a sign that he can know\nl
And, when it comes, wakes blindly to a voice,\nl
A look, a touch, the meaning of a face.\nl
His instrument the dim corporeal mind,\nl
Of celestial insight now forgetful grown,\nl
He seizes on some sign of outward charm\nl
To guide him mid the throng of Nature's hints,\nl
Reads heavenly truths into earth's semblances,\nl
Desires the image for the godhead's sake,\nl
Divines the immortalities of form\nl
And takes the body for the sculptured soul.\nl
Love's adoration like a mystic seer\nl
Through vision looks at the invisible,\nl
In earth's alphabet finds a godlike sense;\nl
But the mind only thinks, “Behold the one\nl
For whom my life has waited long unfilled,\nl
Behold the sudden sovereign of my days.”\nl
Heart feels for heart, limb cries for answering limb;\nl
All strives to enforce the unity all is.\nl
Too far from the Divine, Love seeks his truth\nl
And Life is blind and the instruments deceive\nl
And Powers are there that labour to debase.\nl
Still can the vision come, the joy arrive.\nl
Rare is the cup fit for love's nectar wine,\nl
As rare the vessel that can hold God's birth;\nl
A soul made ready through a thousand years\nl
Is the living mould of a supreme Descent.\nl
These knew each other though in forms thus strange.\nl
Although to sight unknown, though life and mind\nl
Had altered to hold a new significance,\nl
Page 398

These bodies summed the drift of numberless births,\nl
And the spirit to the spirit was the same.\nl
Amazed by a joy for which they had waited long,\nl
The lovers met upon their different paths,\nl
Travellers across the limitless plains of Time\nl
Together drawn from fate-led journeyings\nl
In the self-closed solitude of their human past,\nl
To a swift rapturous dream of future joy\nl
And the unexpected present of these eyes.\nl
By the revealing greatness of a look,\nl
Form-smitten the spirit's memory woke in sense.\nl
The mist was torn that lay between two lives;\nl
Her heart unveiled and his to find her turned;\nl
Attracted as in heaven star by star,\nl
They wondered at each other and rejoiced\nl
And wove affinity in a silent gaze.\nl
A moment passed that was eternity's ray,\nl
An hour began, the matrix of new Time.\nl

\ht Canto Three: Satyavan and Savitri
\par
\sbigcap Out of the voiceless mystery of the past\nl
In a present ignorant of forgotten bonds\nl
These spirits met upon the roads of Time.\nl
Yet in the heart their secret conscious selves\nl
At once aware grew of each other warned\nl
By the first call of a delightful voice\nl
And a first vision of the destined face.\nl
As when being cries to being from its depths\nl
Behind the screen of the external sense\nl
And strives to find the heart-disclosing word,\nl
The passionate speech revealing the soul's need,\nl
But the mind's ignorance veils the inner sight,\nl
Only a little breaks through our earth-made bounds,\nl
So now they met in that momentous hour,\nl
So utter the recognition in the deeps,\nl
The remembrance lost, the oneness felt and missed.\nl
Thus Satyavan spoke first to Savitri:\nl
“O thou who com'st to me out of Time's silences,\nl
Yet thy voice has wakened my heart to an unknown bliss,\nl
Immortal or mortal only in thy frame,\nl
For more than earth speaks to me from thy soul\nl
And more than earth surrounds me in thy gaze,\nl
How art thou named among the sons of men?\nl
Whence hast thou dawned filling my spirit's days,\nl
Brighter than summer, brighter than my flowers,\nl
Into the lonely borders of my life,\nl
O sunlight moulded like a golden maid?\nl
I know that mighty gods are friends of earth.\nl
Amid the pageantries of day and dusk,\nl
Long have I travelled with my pilgrim soul\nl
Moved by the marvel of familiar things.\nl
Page 400

Earth could not hide from me the powers she veils:\nl
Even though moving mid an earthly scene\nl
And the common surfaces of terrestrial things,\nl
My vision saw unblinded by her forms;\nl
The Godhead looked at me from familiar scenes.\nl
I witnessed the virgin bridals of the dawn\nl
Behind the glowing curtains of the sky\nl
Or vying in joy with the bright morning's steps\nl
I paced along the slumbrous coasts of noon,\nl
Or the gold desert of the sunlight crossed\nl
Traversing great wastes of splendour and of fire,\nl
Or met the moon gliding amazed through heaven\nl
In the uncertain wideness of the night,\nl
Or the stars marched on their long sentinel routes\nl
Pointing their spears through the infinitudes:\nl
The day and dusk revealed to me hidden shapes;\nl
Figures have come to me from secret shores\nl
And happy faces looked from ray and flame.\nl
I have heard strange voices cross the ether's waves,\nl
The Centaur's wizard song has thrilled my ear;\nl
I have glimpsed the Apsaras bathing in the pools,\nl
I have seen the wood-nymphs peering through the leaves;\nl
The winds have shown to me their trampling lords,\nl
I have beheld the princes of the Sun\nl
Burning in thousand-pillared homes of light.\nl
So now my mind could dream and my heart fear\nl
That from some wonder-couch beyond our air\nl
Risen in a wide morning of the gods\nl
Thou drov'st thy horses from the Thunderer's worlds.\nl
Although to heaven thy beauty seems allied,\nl
Much rather would my thoughts rejoice to know\nl
That mortal sweetness smiles between thy lids\nl
And thy heart can beat beneath a human gaze\nl
And thy aureate bosom quiver with a look\nl
And its tumult answer to an earth-born voice.\nl
If our time-vexed affections thou canst feel,\nl
Page 401

Earth's ease of simple things can satisfy,\nl
If thy glance can dwell content on earthly soil,\nl
And this celestial summary of delight,\nl
Thy golden body, dally with fatigue\nl
Oppressing with its grace our terrain, while\nl
The frail sweet passing taste of earthly food\nl
Delays thee and the torrent's leaping wine,\nl
Descend. Let thy journey cease, come down to us.\nl
Close is my father's creepered hermitage\nl
Screened by the tall ranks of these silent kings,\nl
Sung to by voices of the hue-robed choirs\nl
Whose chants repeat transcribed in music's notes\nl
The passionate coloured lettering of the boughs\nl
And fill the hours with their melodious cry.\nl
Amid the welcome-hum of many bees\nl
Invade our honied kingdom of the woods;\nl
There let me lead thee into an opulent life.\nl
Bare, simple is the sylvan hermit-life;\nl
Yet is it clad with the jewelry of earth.\nl
Wild winds run—visitors midst the swaying tops,\nl
Through the calm days heaven's sentinels of peace\nl
Couched on a purple robe of sky above\nl
Look down on a rich secrecy and hush\nl
And the chambered nuptial waters chant within.\nl
Enormous, whispering, many-formed around\nl
High forest gods have taken in their arms\nl
The human hour, a guest of their centuried pomps.\nl
Apparelled are the morns in gold and green,\nl
Sunlight and shadow tapestry the walls\nl
To make a resting chamber fit for thee.”\nl
Awhile she paused as if hearing still his voice,\nl
Unwilling to break the charm, then slowly spoke.\nl
Musing she answered, “I am Savitri,\nl
Princess of Madra. Who art thou? What name\nl
Musical on earth expresses thee to men?\nl
What trunk of kings watered by fortunate streams\nl
Page 402

Has flowered at last upon one happy branch?\nl
Why is thy dwelling in the pathless wood\nl
Far from the deeds thy glorious youth demands,\nl
Haunt of the anchorites and earth's wilder broods,\nl
Where only with thy witness self thou roamst\nl
In Nature's green unhuman loneliness\nl
Surrounded by enormous silences\nl
And the blind murmur of primaeval calms?”\nl
And Satyavan replied to Savitri:\nl
“In days when yet his sight looked clear on life,\nl
King Dyumatsena once, the Shalwa, reigned\nl
Through all the tract which from behind these tops\nl
Passing its days of emerald delight\nl
In trusting converse with the traveller winds\nl
Turns, looking back towards the southern heavens,\nl
And leans its flank upon the musing hills.\nl
But equal Fate removed her covering hand.\nl
A living night enclosed the strong man's paths,\nl
Heaven's brilliant gods recalled their careless gifts,\nl
Took from blank eyes their glad and helping ray\nl
And led the uncertain goddess from his side.\nl
Outcast from empire of the outer light,\nl
Lost to the comradeship of seeing men,\nl
He sojourns in two solitudes, within\nl
And in the solemn rustle of the woods.\nl
Son of that king, I, Satyavan, have lived\nl
Contented, for not yet of thee aware,\nl
In my high-peopled loneliness of spirit\nl
And this huge vital murmur kin to me,\nl
Nursed by the vastness, pupil of solitude.\nl
Great Nature came to her recovered child;\nl
I reigned in a kingdom of a nobler kind\nl
Than men can build upon dull Matter's soil;\nl
I met the frankness of the primal earth,\nl
I enjoyed the intimacy of infant God.\nl
In the great tapestried chambers of her state,\nl
Page 403

Free in her boundless palace I have dwelt\nl
Indulged by the warm mother of us all,\nl
Reared with my natural brothers in her house.\nl
I lay in the wide bare embrace of heaven,\nl
The sunlight's radiant blessing clasped my brow,\nl
The moonbeams' silver ecstasy at night\nl
Kissed my dim lids to sleep. Earth's morns were mine;\nl
Lured by faint murmurings with the green-robed hours\nl
I wandered lost in woods, prone to the voice\nl
Of winds and waters, partner of the sun's joy,\nl
A listener to the universal speech:\nl
My spirit satisfied within me knew\nl
Godlike our birthright, luxuried our life\nl
Whose close belongings are the earth and skies.\nl
Before Fate led me into this emerald world,\nl
Aroused by some foreshadowing touch within,\nl
An early prescience in my mind approached\nl
The great dumb animal consciousness of earth\nl
Now grown so close to me who have left old pomps\nl
To live in this grandiose murmur dim and vast.\nl
Already I met her in my spirit's dream.\nl
As if to a deeper country of the soul\nl
Transposing the vivid imagery of earth,\nl
Through an inner seeing and sense a wakening came.\nl
A visioned spell pursued my boyhood's hours,\nl
All things the eye had caught in coloured lines\nl
Were seen anew through the interpreting mind\nl
And in the shape it sought to seize the soul.\nl
An early child-god took my hand that held,\nl
Moved, guided by the seeking of his touch,\nl
Bright forms and hues which fled across his sight;\nl
Limned upon page and stone they spoke to men.\nl
High beauty's visitants my intimates were.\nl
The neighing pride of rapid life that roams\nl
Wind-maned through our pastures, on my seeing mood\nl
Cast shapes of swiftness; trooping spotted deer\nl
Page 404

Against the vesper sky became a song\nl
Of evening to the silence of my soul.\nl
I caught for some eternal eye the sudden\nl
King-fisher flashing to a darkling pool;\nl
A slow swan silvering the azure lake,\nl
A shape of magic whiteness, sailed through dream;\nl
Leaves trembling with the passion of the wind,\nl
Pranked butterflies, the conscious flowers of air,\nl
And wandering wings in blue infinity\nl
Lived on the tablets of my inner sight;\nl
Mountains and trees stood there like thoughts from God.\nl
The brilliant long-bills in their vivid dress,\nl
The peacock scattering on the breeze his moons\nl
Painted my memory like a frescoed wall.\nl
I carved my vision out of wood and stone;\nl
I caught the echoes of a word supreme\nl
And metred the rhythm-beats of infinity\nl
And listened through music for the eternal Voice.\nl
I felt a covert touch, I heard a call,\nl
But could not clasp the body of my God\nl
Or hold between my hands the World-Mother's feet.\nl
In men I met strange portions of a Self\nl
That sought for fragments and in fragments lived:\nl
Each lived in himself and for himself alone\nl
And with the rest joined only fleeting ties;\nl
Each passioned over his surface joy and grief,\nl
Nor saw the Eternal in his secret house.\nl
I conversed with Nature, mused with the changeless stars,\nl
God's watch-fires burning in the ignorant Night,\nl
And saw upon her mighty visage fall\nl
A ray prophetic of the Eternal's sun.\nl
I sat with the forest sages in their trance:\nl
There poured awakening streams of diamond light,\nl
I glimpsed the presence of the One in all.\nl
But still there lacked the last transcendent power\nl
And Matter still slept empty of its Lord.\nl
Page 405

The Spirit was saved, the body lost and mute\nl
Lived still with Death and ancient Ignorance;\nl
The Inconscient was its base, the Void its fate.\nl
But thou hast come and all will surely change:\nl
I shall feel the World-Mother in thy golden limbs\nl
And hear her wisdom in thy sacred voice.\nl
The child of the Void shall be reborn in God,\nl
My Matter shall evade the Inconscient's trance.\nl
My body like my spirit shall be free.\nl
It shall escape from Death and Ignorance.”\nl
And Savitri, musing still, replied to him:\nl
“Speak more to me, speak more, O Satyavan,\nl
Speak of thyself and all thou art within;\nl
I would know thee as if we had ever lived\nl
Together in the chamber of our souls.\nl
Speak till a light shall come into my heart\nl
And my moved mortal mind shall understand\nl
What all the deathless being in me feels.\nl
It knows that thou art he my spirit has sought\nl
Amidst earth's thronging visages and forms\nl
Across the golden spaces of my life.”\nl
And Satyavan like a replying harp\nl
To the insistent calling of a flute\nl
Answered her questioning and let stream to her\nl
His heart in many-coloured waves of speech:\nl
“O golden princess, perfect Savitri,\nl
More I would tell than failing words can speak,\nl
Of all that thou hast meant to me, unknown,\nl
All that the lightning-flash of love reveals\nl
In one great hour of the unveiling gods.\nl
Even a brief nearness has reshaped my life.\nl
For now I know that all I lived and was\nl
Moved towards this moment of my heart's rebirth;\nl
I look back on the meaning of myself,\nl
A soul made ready on earth's soil for thee.\nl
Once were my days like days of other men:\nl
Page 406

To think and act was all, to enjoy and breathe;\nl
This was the width and height of mortal hope:\nl
Yet there came glimpses of a deeper self\nl
That lives behind Life and makes her act its scene.\nl
A truth was felt that screened its shape from mind,\nl
A Greatness working towards a hidden end,\nl
And vaguely through the forms of earth there looked\nl
Something that life is not and yet must be.\nl
I groped for the Mystery with the lantern, Thought.\nl
Its glimmerings lighted with the abstract word\nl
A half-visible ground and travelling yard by yard\nl
It mapped a system of the Self and God.\nl
I could not live the truth it spoke and thought.\nl
I turned to seize its form in visible things,\nl
Hoping to fix its rule by mortal mind,\nl
Imposed a narrow structure of world-law\nl
Upon the freedom of the Infinite,\nl
A hard firm skeleton of outward Truth,\nl
A mental scheme of a mechanic Power.\nl
This light showed more the darknesses unsearched;\nl
It made the original Secrecy more occult;\nl
It could not analyse its cosmic Veil\nl
Or glimpse the Wonder-worker's hidden hand\nl
And trace the pattern of his magic plans.\nl
I plunged into an inner seeing Mind\nl
And knew the secret laws and sorceries\nl
That make of Matter mind's bewildered slave:\nl
The mystery was not solved but deepened more.\nl
I strove to find its hints through Beauty and Art,\nl
But Form cannot unveil the indwelling Power;\nl
Only it throws its symbols at our hearts.\nl
It evoked a mood of self, invoked a sign\nl
Of all the brooding glory hidden in sense:\nl
I lived in the ray but faced not to the sun.\nl
I looked upon the world and missed the Self,\nl
And when I found the Self, I lost the world,\nl
Page 407

My other selves I lost and the body of God,\nl
The link of the finite with the Infinite,\nl
The bridge between the appearance and the Truth,\nl
The mystic aim for which the world was made,\nl
The human sense of Immortality.\nl
But now the gold link comes to me with thy feet\nl
And His gold sun has shone on me from thy face.\nl
For now another realm draws near with thee\nl
And now diviner voices fill my ear,\nl
A strange new world swims to me in thy gaze\nl
Approaching like a star from unknown heavens;\nl
A cry of spheres comes with thee and a song\nl
Of flaming gods. I draw a wealthier breath\nl
And in a fierier march of moments move.\nl
My mind transfigures to a rapturous seer.\nl
A foam-leap travelling from the waves of bliss\nl
Has changed my heart and changed the earth around:\nl
All with thy coming fills. Air, soil and stream\nl
Wear bridal raiment to be fit for thee\nl
And sunlight grows a shadow of thy hue\nl
Because of change within me by thy look.\nl
Come nearer to me from thy car of light\nl
On this green sward disdaining not our soil.\nl
For here are secret spaces made for thee\nl
Whose caves of emerald long to screen thy form.\nl
Wilt thou not make this mortal bliss thy sphere?\nl
Descend, O happiness, with thy moon-gold feet\nl
Enrich earth's floors upon whose sleep we lie.\nl
O my bright beauty's princess Savitri,\nl
By my delight and thy own joy compelled\nl
Enter my life, thy chamber and thy shrine.\nl
In the great quietness where spirits meet,\nl
Led by my hushed desire into my woods\nl
Let the dim rustling arches over thee lean;\nl
One with the breath of things eternal live,\nl
Thy heart-beats near to mine, till there shall leap\nl
Page 408

Enchanted from the fragrance of the flowers\nl
A moment which all murmurs shall recall\nl
And every bird remember in its cry.”\nl

\spar Allured to her lashes by his passionate words\nl
Her fathomless soul looked out at him from her eyes;\nl
Passing her lips in liquid sounds it spoke.\nl
This word alone she uttered and said all:\nl
“O Satyavan, I have heard thee and I know;\nl
I know that thou and only thou art he.”\nl
Then down she came from her high carven car\nl
Descending with a soft and faltering haste;\nl
Her many-hued raiment glistening in the light\nl
Hovered a moment over the wind-stirred grass,\nl
Mixed with a glimmer of her body's ray\nl
Like lovely plumage of a settling bird.\nl
Her gleaming feet upon the green-gold sward\nl
Scattered a memory of wandering beams\nl
And lightly pressed the unspoken desire of earth\nl
Cherished in her too brief passing by the soil.\nl
Then flitting like pale-brilliant moths her hands\nl
Took from the sylvan verge's sunlit arms\nl
A load of their jewel-faces' clustering swarms,\nl
Companions of the spring-time and the breeze.\nl
A candid garland set with simple forms\nl
Her rapid fingers taught a flower song,\nl
The stanzaed movement of a marriage hymn.\nl
Profound in perfume and immersed in hue\nl
They mixed their yearning's coloured signs and made\nl
The bloom of their purity and passion one.\nl
A sacrament of joy in treasuring palms\nl
She brought, flower-symbol of her offered life,\nl
Then with raised hands that trembled a little now\nl
At the very closeness that her soul desired,\nl
This bond of sweetness, their bright union's sign,\nl
She laid on the bosom coveted by her love.\nl
Page 409

As if inclined before some gracious god\nl
Who has out of his mist of greatness shone\nl
To fill with beauty his adorer's hours,\nl
She bowed and touched his feet with worshipping hands;\nl
She made her life his world for him to tread\nl
And made her body the room of his delight,\nl
Her beating heart a remembrancer of bliss.\nl
He bent to her and took into his own\nl
Their married yearning joined like folded hopes;\nl
As if a whole rich world suddenly possessed,\nl
Wedded to all he had been, became himself,\nl
An inexhaustible joy made his alone,\nl
He gathered all Savitri into his clasp.\nl
Around her his embrace became the sign\nl
Of a locked closeness through slow intimate years,\nl
A first sweet summary of delight to come,\nl
One brevity intense of all long life.\nl
In a wide moment of two souls that meet\nl
She felt her being flow into him as in waves\nl
A river pours into a mighty sea.\nl
As when a soul is merging into God\nl
To live in Him for ever and know His joy,\nl
Her consciousness grew aware of him alone\nl
And all her separate self was lost in his.\nl
As a starry heaven encircles happy earth,\nl
He shut her into himself in a circle of bliss\nl
And shut the world into himself and her.\nl
A boundless isolation made them one;\nl
He was aware of her enveloping him\nl
And let her penetrate his very soul\nl
As is a world by the world's spirit filled,\nl
As the mortal wakes into Eternity,\nl
As the finite opens to the Infinite.\nl
Thus were they in each other lost awhile,\nl
Then drawing back from their long ecstasy's trance\nl
Came into a new self and a new world.\nl
Page 410

Each now was a part of the other's unity,\nl
The world was but their twin self-finding's scene\nl
Or their own wedded being's vaster frame.\nl
On the high glowing cupola of the day\nl
Fate tied a knot with morning's halo threads\nl
While by the ministry of an auspice-hour\nl
Heart-bound before the sun, their marriage fire,\nl
The wedding of the eternal Lord and Spouse\nl
Took place again on earth in human forms:\nl
In a new act of the drama of the world\nl
The united Two began a greater age.\nl
In the silence and murmur of that emerald world\nl
And the mutter of the priest-wind's sacred verse,\nl
Amid the choral whispering of the leaves\nl
Love's twain had joined together and grew one.\nl
The natural miracle was wrought once more:\nl
In the immutable ideal world\nl
One human moment was eternal made.\nl

\spar Then down the narrow path where their lives had met\nl
He led and showed to her her future world,\nl
Love's refuge and corner of happy solitude.\nl
At the path's end through a green cleft in the trees\nl
She saw a clustering line of hermit-roofs\nl
And looked now first on her heart's future home,\nl
The thatch that covered the life of Satyavan.\nl
Adorned with creepers and red climbing flowers\nl
It seemed a sylvan beauty in her dreams\nl
Slumbering with brown body and tumbled hair\nl
In her chamber inviolate of emerald peace.\nl
Around it stretched the forest's anchorite mood\nl
Lost in the depths of its own solitude.\nl
Then moved by the deep joy she could not speak,\nl
A little depth of it quivering in her words,\nl
Her happy voice cried out to Satyavan:\nl
“My heart will stay here on this forest verge\nl
Page 411

And close to this thatched roof while I am far:\nl
Now of more wandering it has no need.\nl
But I must haste back to my father's house\nl
Which soon will lose one loved accustomed tread\nl
And listen in vain for a once cherished voice.\nl
For soon I shall return nor ever again\nl
Oneness must sever its recovered bliss\nl
Or fate sunder our lives while life is ours.”\nl
Once more she mounted on the carven car\nl
And under the ardour of a fiery noon\nl
Less bright than the splendour of her thoughts and dreams\nl
She sped swift-reined, swift-hearted but still saw\nl
In still lucidities of sight's inner world\nl
Through the cool-scented wood's luxurious gloom\nl
On shadowy paths between great rugged trunks\nl
Pace towards a tranquil clearing Satyavan.\nl
A nave of trees enshrined the hermit thatch,\nl
The new deep covert of her felicity,\nl
Preferred to heaven her soul's temple and home.\nl
This now remained with her, her heart's constant scene.\nl

\sbigcap In silent bounds bordering the mortal's plane\nl
Crossing a wide expanse of brilliant peace\nl
Narad the heavenly sage from Paradise\nl
Came chanting through the large and lustrous air.\nl
Attracted by the golden summer-earth\nl
That lay beneath him like a glowing bowl\nl
Tilted upon a table of the Gods,\nl
Turning as if moved round by an unseen hand\nl
To catch the warmth and blaze of a small sun,\nl
He passed from the immortals' happy paths\nl
To a world of toil and quest and grief and hope,\nl
To these rooms of the see-saw game of death with life.\nl
Across an intangible border of soul-space\nl
He passed from Mind into material things\nl
Amid the inventions of the inconscient Self\nl
And the workings of a blind somnambulist Force.\nl
Below him circling burned the myriad suns:\nl
He bore the ripples of the etheric sea;\nl
A primal Air brought the first joy of touch;\nl
A secret Spirit drew its mighty breath\nl
Contracting and expanding this huge world\nl
In its formidable circuit through the Void;\nl
The secret might of the creative Fire\nl
Displayed its triple power to build and form,\nl
Its infinitesimal wave-sparks' weaving dance,\nl
Its nebulous units grounding shape and mass,\nl
Magic foundation and pattern of a world,\nl
Its radiance bursting into the light of stars;\nl
He felt a sap of life, a sap of death;\nl
Into solid Matter's dense communion\nl
Plunging and its obscure oneness of forms\nl
Page 415

He shared with a dumb Spirit identity.\nl
He beheld the cosmic Being at his task,\nl
His eyes measured the spaces, gauged the depths,\nl
His inner gaze the movements of the soul,\nl
He saw the eternal labour of the Gods,\nl
And looked upon the life of beasts and men.\nl
A change now fell upon the singer's mood,\nl
A rapture and a pathos moved his voice;\nl
He sang no more of Light that never wanes,\nl
And oneness and pure everlasting bliss,\nl
He sang no more the deathless heart of Love,\nl
His chant was a hymn of Ignorance and Fate.\nl
He sang the name of Vishnu and the birth\nl
And joy and passion of the mystic world,\nl
And how the stars were made and life began\nl
And the mute regions stirred with the throb of a Soul.\nl
He sang the Inconscient and its secret self,\nl
Its power omnipotent knowing not what it does,\nl
All-shaping without will or thought or sense,\nl
Its blind unerring occult mystery,\nl
And darkness yearning towards the eternal Light,\nl
And Love that broods within the dim abyss\nl
And waits the answer of the human heart,\nl
And death that climbs to immortality.\nl
He sang of the Truth that cries from Night's blind deeps,\nl
And the Mother-Wisdom hid in Nature's breast\nl
And the Idea that through her dumbness works\nl
And the miracle of her transforming hands,\nl
Of life that slumbers in the stone and sun\nl
And Mind subliminal in mindless life,\nl
And the Consciousness that wakes in beasts and men.\nl
He sang of the glory and marvel still to be born,\nl
Of Godhead throwing off at last its veil,\nl
Of bodies made divine and life made bliss,\nl
Immortal sweetness clasping immortal might,\nl
Heart sensing heart, thought looking straight at thought,\nl
Page 416

And the delight when every barrier falls,\nl
And the transfiguration and the ecstasy.\nl
And as he sang the demons wept with joy\nl
Foreseeing the end of their long dreadful task\nl
And the defeat for which they hoped in vain,\nl
And glad release from their self-chosen doom\nl
And return into the One from whom they came.\nl
He who has conquered the Immortals' seats,\nl
Came down to men on earth the Man divine.\nl
As darts a lightning streak, a glory fell\nl
Nearing until the rapt eyes of the sage\nl
Looked out from luminous cloud and, strangely limned,\nl
His face, a beautiful mask of antique joy,\nl
Appearing in light descended where arose\nl
King Aswapati's palace to the winds\nl
In Madra, flowering up in delicate stone.\nl
There welcomed him the sage and thoughtful king,\nl
At his side a creature beautiful, passionate, wise,\nl
Aspiring like a sacrificial flame\nl
Skyward from its earth-seat through luminous air,\nl
Queen-browed, the human mother of Savitri.\nl
There for an hour untouched by the earth's siege\nl
They ceased from common life and care and sat\nl
Inclining to the high and rhythmic voice,\nl
While in his measured chant the heavenly seer\nl
Spoke of the toils of men and what the gods\nl
Strive for on earth, and joy that throbs behind\nl
The marvel and the mystery of pain.\nl
He sang to them of the lotus-heart of love\nl
With all its thousand luminous buds of truth,\nl
Which quivering sleeps veiled by apparent things.\nl
It trembles at each touch, it strives to wake\nl
And one day it shall hear a blissful voice\nl
And in the garden of the Spouse shall bloom\nl
When she is seized by her discovered lord.\nl
A mighty shuddering coil of ecstasy\nl
Page 417

Crept through the deep heart of the universe.\nl
Out of her Matter's stupor, her mind's dreams,\nl
She woke, she looked upon God's unveiled face.\nl

\spar Even as he sang and rapture stole through earth-time\nl
And caught the heavens, came with a call of hooves,\nl
As of her swift heart hastening, Savitri;\nl
Her radiant tread glimmered across the floor.\nl
A happy wonder in her fathomless gaze,\nl
Changed by the halo of her love she came;\nl
Her eyes rich with a shining mist of joy\nl
As one who comes from a heavenly embassy\nl
Discharging the proud mission of her heart,\nl
One carrying the sanction of the gods\nl
To her love and its luminous eternity,\nl
She stood before her mighty father's throne\nl
And, eager for beauty on discovered earth\nl
Transformed and new in her heart's miracle-light,\nl
Saw like a rose of marvel, worshipping,\nl
The fire-tinged sweetness of the son of Heaven.\nl
He flung on her his vast immortal look;\nl
His inner gaze surrounded her with its light\nl
And reining back knowledge from his immortal lips\nl
He cried to her, “Who is this that comes, the bride,\nl
The flame-born, and round her illumined head\nl
Pouring their lights her hymeneal pomps\nl
Move flashing about her? From what green glimmer of glades\nl
Retreating into dewy silences\nl
Or half-seen verge of waters moon-betrayed\nl
Bringst thou this glory of enchanted eyes?\nl
Earth has gold-hued expanses, shadowy hills\nl
That cowl their dreaming phantom heads in night,\nl
And, guarded in a cloistral joy of woods,\nl
Screened banks sink down into felicity\nl
Seized by the curved incessant yearning hands\nl
And ripple-passion of the upgazing stream:\nl
Page 418

Amid cool-lipped murmurs of its pure embrace\nl
They lose their souls on beds of trembling reeds.\nl
And all these are mysterious presences\nl
In which some spirit's immortal bliss is felt,\nl
And they betray the earth-born heart to joy.\nl
There hast thou paused, and marvelling borne eyes\nl
Unknown, or heard a voice that forced thy life\nl
To strain its rapture through thy listening soul?\nl
Or, if my thought could trust this shimmering gaze,\nl
It would say thou hast not drunk from an earthly cup,\nl
But stepping through azure curtains of the noon\nl
Thou wast surrounded on a magic verge\nl
In brighter countries than man's eyes can bear.\nl
Assailed by trooping voices of delight\nl
And seized mid a sunlit glamour of the boughs\nl
In faery woods, led down the gleaming slopes\nl
Of Gandhamadan where the Apsaras roam,\nl
Thy limbs have shared the sports which none has seen,\nl
And in god-haunts thy human footsteps strayed,\nl
Thy mortal bosom quivered with god-speech\nl
And thy soul answered to a Word unknown.\nl
What feet of gods, what ravishing flutes of heaven\nl
Have thrilled high melodies round, from near and far\nl
Approaching through the soft and revelling air,\nl
Which still surprised thou hearest? They have fed\nl
Thy silence on some red strange-ecstasied fruit\nl
And thou hast trod the dim moon-peaks of bliss.\nl
Reveal, O winged with light, whence thou hast flown\nl
Hastening bright-hued through the green tangled earth,\nl
Thy body rhythmical with the spring-bird's call.\nl
The empty roses of thy hands are filled\nl
Only with their own beauty and the thrill\nl
Of a remembered clasp, and in thee glows\nl
A heavenly jar, thy firm deep-honied heart,\nl
New-brimming with a sweet and nectarous wine.\nl
Thou hast not spoken with the kings of pain.\nl
Page 419

Life's perilous music rings yet to thy ear\nl
Far-melodied, rapid and grand, a Centaur's song,\nl
Or soft as water plashing mid the hills,\nl
Or mighty as a great chant of many winds.\nl
Moon-bright thou livest in thy inner bliss.\nl
Thou comest like a silver deer through groves\nl
Of coral flowers and buds of glowing dreams,\nl
Or fleest like a wind-goddess through leaves,\nl
Or roamst, O ruby-eyed and snow-winged dove,\nl
Flitting through thickets of thy pure desires\nl
In the unwounded beauty of thy soul.\nl
These things are only images to thy earth,\nl
But truest truth of that which in thee sleeps.\nl
For such is thy spirit, a sister of the gods,\nl
Thy earthly body lovely to the eyes\nl
And thou art kin in joy to heaven's sons.\nl
O thou who hast come to this great perilous world\nl
Now only seen through the splendour of thy dreams,\nl
Where hardly love and beauty can live safe,\nl
Thyself a being dangerously great,\nl
A soul alone in a golden house of thought\nl
Has lived walled in by the safety of thy dreams.\nl
On heights of happiness leaving doom asleep\nl
Who hunts unseen the unconscious lives of men,\nl
If thy heart could live locked in the ideal's gold,\nl
As high, as happy might thy waking be!\nl
If for all time doom could be left to sleep!”\nl
\sparn He spoke but held his knowledge back from words.\nl
As a cloud plays with lightnings' vivid laugh,\nl
But still holds back the thunder in its heart,\nl
Only he let bright images escape.\nl
His speech like glimmering music veiled his thoughts;\nl
As a wind flatters the bright summer air,\nl
Pitiful to mortals, only to them it spoke\nl
Of living beauty and of present bliss:\nl
He hid in his all-knowing mind the rest.\nl
Page 420

To those who hearkened to his celestial voice,\nl
The veil heaven's pity throws on future pain\nl
The Immortals' sanction seemed of endless joy.\nl
But Aswapati answered to the seer;—\nl
His listening mind had marked the dubious close,\nl
An ominous shadow felt behind the words,\nl
But calm like one who ever sits facing Fate\nl
Here mid the dangerous contours of earth's life,\nl
He answered covert thought with guarded speech:\nl
“O deathless sage who knowest all things here,\nl
If I could read by the ray of my own wish\nl
Through the carved shield of symbol images\nl
Which thou hast thrown before thy heavenly mind\nl
I might see the steps of a young godlike life\nl
Happily beginning luminous-eyed on earth;\nl
Between the Unknowable and the Unseen\nl
Born on the borders of two wonder-worlds,\nl
It flames out symbols of the infinite\nl
And lives in a great light of inner suns.\nl
For it has read and broken the wizard seals;\nl
It has drunk of the Immortal's wells of joy,\nl
It has looked across the jewel bars of heaven,\nl
It has entered the aspiring Secrecy,\nl
It sees beyond terrestrial common things\nl
And communes with the Powers that build the worlds,\nl
Till through the shining gates and mystic streets\nl
Of the city of lapis lazuli and pearl\nl
Proud deeds step forth, a rank and march of gods.\nl
Although in pauses of our human lives\nl
Earth keeps for man some short and perfect hours\nl
When the inconstant tread of Time can seem\nl
The eternal moment which the deathless live,\nl
Yet rare that touch upon the mortal's world:\nl
Hardly a soul and body here are born\nl
In the fierce difficult movement of the stars,\nl
Whose life can keep the paradisal note,\nl
Page 421

Its rhythm repeat the many-toned melody\nl
Tirelessly throbbing through the rapturous air\nl
Caught in the song that sways the Apsara's limbs\nl
When she floats gleaming like a cloud of light,\nl
A wave of joy on heaven's moonstone floor.\nl
Behold this image cast by light and love,\nl
A stanza of the ardour of the gods\nl
Perfectly rhymed, a pillared ripple of gold!\nl
Her body like a brimmed pitcher of delight\nl
Shaped in a splendour of gold-coloured bronze\nl
As if to seize earth's truth of hidden bliss.\nl
Dream-made illumined mirrors are her eyes\nl
Draped subtly in a slumbrous fringe of jet,\nl
Retaining heaven's reflections in their depths.\nl
Even as her body, such is she within.\nl
Heaven's lustrous mornings gloriously recur,\nl
Like drops of fire upon a silver page,\nl
In her young spirit yet untouched with tears.\nl
All beautiful things eternal seem and new\nl
To virgin wonder in her crystal soul.\nl
The unchanging blue reveals its spacious thought;\nl
Marvellous the moon floats on through wondering skies;\nl
Earth's flowers spring up and laugh at time and death;\nl
The charmed mutations of the enchanter life\nl
Race like bright children past the smiling hours.\nl
If but this joy of life could last, nor pain\nl
Throw its bronze note into her rhythmed days!\nl
Behold her, singer with the prescient gaze,\nl
And let thy blessing chant that this fair child\nl
Shall pour the nectar of a sorrowless life\nl
Around her from her lucid heart of love,\nl
Heal with her bliss the tired breast of earth\nl
And cast like a happy snare felicity.\nl
As grows the great and golden bounteous tree\nl
Flowering by Alacananda's murmuring waves,\nl
Where with enamoured speed the waters run\nl
Page 422

Lisping and babbling to the splendour of morn\nl
And cling with lyric laughter round the knees\nl
Of heaven's daughters dripping magic rain\nl
Pearl-bright from moon-gold limbs and cloudy hair,\nl
So are her dawns like jewelled leaves of light,\nl
So casts she her felicity on men.\nl
A flame of radiant happiness she was born\nl
And surely will that flame set earth alight:\nl
Doom surely will see her pass and say no word!\nl
But too often here the careless Mother leaves\nl
Her chosen in the envious hands of Fate:\nl
The harp of God falls mute, its call to bliss\nl
Discouraged fails mid earth's unhappy sounds;\nl
The strings of the siren Ecstasy cry not here\nl
Or soon are silenced in the human heart.\nl
Of sorrow's songs we have enough: bid once\nl
Her glad and griefless days bring heaven here.\nl
Or must fire always test the great of soul?\nl
Along the dreadful causeway of the Gods,\nl
Armoured with love and faith and sacred joy,\nl
A traveller to the Eternal's house,\nl
Once let unwounded pass a mortal life.”\nl
But Narad answered not; silent he sat,\nl
Knowing that words are vain and Fate is lord.\nl
He looked into the unseen with seeing eyes,\nl
Then, dallying with the mortal's ignorance\nl
Like one who knows not, questioning, he cried:\nl
“On what high mission went her hastening wheels?\nl
Whence came she with this glory in her heart\nl
And Paradise made visible in her eyes?\nl
What sudden God has met, what face supreme?”\nl
To whom the king, “The red asoca watched\nl
Her going forth which now sees her return.\nl
Arisen into an air of flaming dawn\nl
Like a bright bird tired of her lonely branch,\nl
To find her own lord, since to her on earth\nl
Page 423

He came not yet, this sweetness wandered forth\nl
Cleaving her way with the beat of her rapid wings.\nl
Led by a distant call her vague swift flight\nl
Threaded the summer morns and sunlit lands.\nl
The happy rest her burdened lashes keep\nl
And these charmed guardian lips hold treasured still.\nl
Virgin who comest perfected by joy,\nl
Reveal the name thy sudden heart-beats learned.\nl
Whom hast thou chosen, kingliest among men?”\nl
And Savitri answered with her still calm voice\nl
As one who speaks beneath the eyes of Fate:\nl
“Father and king, I have carried out thy will.\nl
One whom I sought I found in distant lands;\nl
I have obeyed my heart, I have heard its call.\nl
On the borders of a dreaming wilderness\nl
Mid Shalwa's giant hills and brooding woods\nl
In his thatched hermitage Dyumatsena dwells,\nl
Blind, exiled, outcast, once a mighty king.\nl
The son of Dyumatsena, Satyavan,\nl
I have met on the wild forest's lonely verge.\nl
My father, I have chosen. This is done.”\nl
Astonished, all sat silent for a space.\nl
Then Aswapati looked within and saw\nl
A heavy shadow float above the name\nl
Chased by a sudden and stupendous light;\nl
He looked into his daughter's eyes and spoke:\nl
“Well hast thou done and I approve thy choice.\nl
If this is all, then all is surely well;\nl
If there is more, then all can still be well.\nl
Whether it seem good or evil to men's eyes,\nl
Only for good the secret Will can work.\nl
Our destiny is written in double terms:\nl
Through Nature's contraries we draw nearer God;\nl
Out of the darkness we still grow to light.\nl
Death is our road to immortality.\nl
`Cry woe, cry woe,' the world's lost voices wail,\nl
Page 424

Yet conquers the eternal Good at last.”\nl
Then might the sage have spoken, but the king\nl
In haste broke out and stayed the dangerous word:\nl
“O singer of the ultimate ecstasy,\nl
Lend not a dangerous vision to the blind\nl
Because by native right thou hast seen clear.\nl
Impose not on the mortal's tremulous breast\nl
The dire ordeal that foreknowledge brings;\nl
Demand not now the Godhead in our acts.\nl
Here are not happy peaks the heaven-nymphs roam\nl
Or Coilas or Vaicountha's starry stair:\nl
Abrupt, jagged hills only the mighty climb\nl
Are here where few dare even think to rise;\nl
Far voices call down from the dizzy rocks,\nl
Chill, slippery, precipitous are the paths.\nl
Too hard the gods are with man's fragile race;\nl
In their large heavens they dwell exempt from Fate\nl
And they forget the wounded feet of man,\nl
His limbs that faint beneath the whips of grief,\nl
His heart that hears the tread of time and death.\nl
The future's road is hid from mortal sight:\nl
He moves towards a veiled and secret face.\nl
To light one step in front is all his hope\nl
And only for a little strength he asks\nl
To meet the riddle of his shrouded fate.\nl
Awaited by a vague and half-seen force,\nl
Aware of danger to his uncertain hours\nl
He guards his flickering yearnings from her breath;\nl
He feels not when the dreadful fingers close\nl
Around him with the grasp none can elude.\nl
If thou canst loose her grip, then only speak.\nl
Perhaps from the iron snare there is escape:\nl
Our mind perhaps deceives us with its words\nl
And gives the name of doom to our own choice;\nl
Perhaps the blindness of our will is Fate.”\nl
He said and Narad answered not the king.\nl
Page 425

But now the queen alarmed lifted her voice:\nl
“O seer, thy bright arrival has been timed\nl
To this high moment of a happy life;\nl
Then let the speech benign of griefless spheres\nl
Confirm this blithe conjunction of two stars\nl
And sanction joy with thy celestial voice.\nl
Here drag not in the peril of our thoughts,\nl
Let not our words create the doom they fear.\nl
Here is no cause for dread, no chance for grief\nl
To raise her ominous head and stare at love.\nl
A single spirit in a multitude,\nl
Happy is Satyavan mid earthly men\nl
Whom Savitri has chosen for her mate,\nl
And fortunate the forest hermitage\nl
Where leaving her palace and riches and a throne\nl
My Savitri will dwell and bring in heaven.\nl
Then let thy blessing put the immortals' seal\nl
On these bright lives' unstained felicity\nl
Pushing the ominous Shadow from their days.\nl
Too heavy falls a Shadow on man's heart;\nl
It dares not be too happy upon earth.\nl
It dreads the blow dogging too vivid joys,\nl
A lash unseen in Fate's extended hand,\nl
The danger lurking in fortune's proud extremes,\nl
An irony in life's indulgent smile,\nl
And trembles at the laughter of the gods.\nl
Or if crouches unseen a panther doom,\nl
If wings of Evil brood above that house,\nl
Then also speak, that we may turn aside\nl
And rescue our lives from hazard of wayside doom\nl
And chance entanglement of an alien fate.”\nl
And Narad slowly answered to the queen:\nl
“What help is in prevision to the driven?\nl
Safe doors cry opening near, the doomed pass on.\nl
A future knowledge is an added pain,\nl
A torturing burden and a fruitless light\nl
Page 426

On the enormous scene that Fate has built.\nl
The eternal poet, universal Mind,\nl
Has paged each line of his imperial act;\nl
Invisible the giant actors tread\nl
And man lives like some secret player's mask.\nl
He knows not even what his lips shall speak.\nl
For a mysterious Power compels his steps\nl
And life is stronger than his trembling soul.\nl
None can refuse what the stark Force demands:\nl
Her eyes are fixed upon her mighty aim;\nl
No cry or prayer can turn her from her path.\nl
She has leaped an arrow from the bow of God.”\nl
His words were theirs who live unforced to grieve\nl
And help by calm the swaying wheels of life\nl
And the long restlessness of transient things\nl
And the trouble and passion of the unquiet world.\nl
As though her own bosom were pierced the mother saw\nl
The ancient human sentence strike her child,\nl
Her sweetness that deserved another fate\nl
Only a larger measure given of tears.\nl
Aspiring to the nature of the gods,\nl
A mind proof-armoured mailed in mighty thoughts,\nl
A will entire couchant behind wisdom's shield,\nl
Though to still heavens of knowledge she had risen,\nl
Though calm and wise and Aswapati's queen,\nl
Human was she still and opened her doors to grief;\nl
The stony-eyed injustice she accused\nl
Of the marble godhead of inflexible Law,\nl
Nor sought the strength extreme adversity brings\nl
To lives that stand erect and front the World-Power:\nl
Her heart appealed against the impartial judge,\nl
Taxed with perversity the impersonal One.\nl
Her tranquil spirit she called not to her aid,\nl
But as a common man beneath his load\nl
Grows faint and breathes his pain in ignorant words,\nl
So now she arraigned the world's impassive will:\nl
Page 427

“What stealthy doom has crept across her path\nl
Emerging from the dark forest's sullen heart,\nl
What evil thing stood smiling by the way\nl
And wore the beauty of the Shalwa boy?\nl
Perhaps he came an enemy from her past\nl
Armed with a hidden force of ancient wrongs,\nl
Himself unknowing, and seized her unknown.\nl
Here dreadfully entangled love and hate\nl
Meet us blind wanderers mid the perils of Time.\nl
Our days are links of a disastrous chain,\nl
Necessity avenges casual steps;\nl
Old cruelties come back unrecognised,\nl
The gods make use of our forgotten deeds.\nl
Yet all in vain the bitter law was made.\nl
Our own minds are the justicers of doom.\nl
For nothing have we learned, but still repeat\nl
Our stark misuse of self and others' souls.\nl
There are dire alchemies of the human heart\nl
And fallen from his ethereal element\nl
Love darkens to the spirit of nether gods.\nl
The dreadful angel, angry with his joys\nl
Woundingly sweet he cannot yet forego,\nl
Is pitiless to the soul his gaze disarmed,\nl
He visits with his own pangs his quivering prey\nl
Forcing us to cling enamoured to his grip\nl
As if in love with our own agony.\nl
This is one poignant misery in the world,\nl
And grief has other lassoes for our life.\nl
Our sympathies become our torturers.\nl
Strength have I my own punishment to bear,\nl
Knowing it just, but on this earth perplexed,\nl
Smitten in the sorrow of scourged and helpless things,\nl
Often it faints to meet other suffering eyes.\nl
We are not as the gods who know not grief\nl
And look impassive on a suffering world,\nl
Calm they gaze down on the little human scene\nl
Page 428

And the short-lived passion crossing mortal hearts.\nl
An ancient tale of woe can move us still,\nl
We keep the ache of breasts that breathe no more,\nl
We are shaken by the sight of human pain,\nl
And share the miseries that others feel.\nl
Ours not the passionless lids that cannot age.\nl
Too hard for us is heaven's indifference:\nl
Our own tragedies are not enough for us,\nl
All pathos and all sufferings we make ours;\nl
We have sorrow for a greatness passed away\nl
And feel the touch of tears in mortal things.\nl
Even a stranger's anguish rends my heart,\nl
And this, O Narad, is my well-loved child.\nl
Hide not from us our doom, if doom is ours.\nl
This is the worst, an unknown face of Fate,\nl
A terror ominous, mute, felt more than seen\nl
Behind our seat by day, our couch by night,\nl
A Fate lurking in the shadow of our hearts,\nl
The anguish of the unseen that waits to strike.\nl
To know is best, however hard to bear.”\nl
Then cried the sage piercing the mother's heart,\nl
Forcing to steel the will of Savitri,\nl
His words set free the spring of cosmic Fate.\nl
The great Gods use the pain of human hearts\nl
As a sharp axe to hew their cosmic road:\nl
They squander lavishly men's blood and tears\nl
For a moment's purpose in their fateful work.\nl
This cosmic Nature's balance is not ours\nl
Nor the mystic measure of her need and use.\nl
A single word lets loose vast agencies;\nl
A casual act determines the world's fate.\nl
So now he set free destiny in that hour.\nl
“The truth thou hast claimed; I give to thee the truth.\nl
A marvel of the meeting earth and heavens\nl
Is he whom Savitri has chosen mid men,\nl
His figure is the front of Nature's march,\nl
Page 429

His single being excels the works of Time.\nl
A sapphire cutting from the sleep of heaven,\nl
Delightful is the soul of Satyavan,\nl
A ray out of the rapturous Infinite,\nl
A silence waking to a hymn of joy.\nl
A divinity and kingliness gird his brow;\nl
His eyes keep a memory from a world of bliss.\nl
As brilliant as a lonely moon in heaven,\nl
Gentle like the sweet bud that spring desires,\nl
Pure like a stream that kisses silent banks,\nl
He takes with bright surprise spirit and sense.\nl
A living knot of golden Paradise,\nl
A blue Immense he leans to the longing world,\nl
Time's joy borrowed out of eternity,\nl
A star of splendour or a rose of bliss.\nl
In him soul and Nature, equal Presences,\nl
Balance and fuse in a wide harmony.\nl
The Happy in their bright ether have not hearts\nl
More sweet and true than this of mortal make\nl
That takes all joy as the world's native gift\nl
And to all gives joy as the world's natural right.\nl
His speech carries a light of inner truth,\nl
And a large-eyed communion with the Power\nl
In common things has made veilless his mind,\nl
A seer in earth-shapes of garbless deity.\nl
A tranquil breadth of sky windless and still\nl
Watching the world like a mind of unplumbed thought,\nl
A silent space musing and luminous\nl
Uncovered by the morning to delight,\nl
A green tangle of trees upon a happy hill\nl
Made into a murmuring nest by southern winds,\nl
These are his images and parallels,\nl
His kin in beauty and in depth his peers.\nl
A will to climb lifts a delight to live,\nl
Heaven's height companion of earth-beauty's charm,\nl
An aspiration to the immortals' air\nl
Page 430

Lain on the lap of mortal ecstasy.\nl
His sweetness and his joy attract all hearts\nl
To live with his own in a glad tenancy,\nl
His strength is like a tower built to reach heaven,\nl
A godhead quarried from the stones of life.\nl
O loss, if death into its elements\nl
Of which his gracious envelope was built,\nl
Shatter this vase before it breathes its sweets,\nl
As if earth could not keep too long from heaven\nl
A treasure thus unique loaned by the gods,\nl
A being so rare, of so divine a make!\nl
In one brief year when this bright hour flies back\nl
And perches careless on a branch of Time,\nl
This sovereign glory ends heaven lent to earth,\nl
This splendour vanishes from the mortal's sky:\nl
Heaven's greatness came, but was too great to stay.\nl
Twelve swift-winged months are given to him and her;\nl
This day returning Satyavan must die.”\nl
A lightning bright and nude the sentence fell.\nl
But the queen cried: “Vain then can be heaven's grace!\nl
Heaven mocks us with the brilliance of its gifts,\nl
For Death is a cupbearer of the wine\nl
Of too brief joy held up to mortal lips\nl
For a passionate moment by the careless gods.\nl
But I reject the grace and the mockery.\nl
Mounting thy car go forth, O Savitri,\nl
And travel once more through the peopled lands.\nl
Alas, in the green gladness of the woods\nl
Thy heart has stooped to a misleading call.\nl
Choose once again and leave this fated head,\nl
Death is the gardener of this wonder-tree;\nl
Love's sweetness sleeps in his pale marble hand.\nl
Advancing in a honeyed line but closed,\nl
A little joy would buy too bitter an end.\nl
Plead not thy choice, for death has made it vain.\nl
Thy youth and radiance were not born to lie\nl
Page 431

A casket void dropped on a careless soil;\nl
A choice less rare may call a happier fate.”\nl
But Savitri answered from her violent heart,—\nl
Her voice was calm, her face was fixed like steel:\nl
“Once my heart chose and chooses not again.\nl
The word I have spoken can never be erased,\nl
It is written in the record book of God.\nl
The truth once uttered, from the earth's air effaced,\nl
By mind forgotten, sounds immortally\nl
For ever in the memory of Time.\nl
Once the dice fall thrown by the hand of Fate\nl
In an eternal moment of the gods.\nl
My heart has sealed its troth to Satyavan:\nl
Its signature adverse Fate cannot efface,\nl
Its seal not Fate nor Death nor Time dissolve.\nl
Those who shall part who have grown one being within?\nl
Death's grip can break our bodies, not our souls;\nl
If death take him, I too know how to die.\nl
Let Fate do with me what she will or can;\nl
I am stronger than death and greater than my fate;\nl
My love shall outlast the world, doom falls from me\nl
Helpless against my immortality.\nl
Fate's law may change, but not my spirit's will.”\nl
An adamant will, she cast her speech like bronze.\nl
But in the queen's mind listening her words\nl
Rang like the voice of a self-chosen Doom\nl
Denying every issue of escape.\nl
To her own despair answer the mother made;\nl
As one she cried who in her heavy heart\nl
Labours amid the sobbing of her hopes\nl
To wake a note of help from sadder strings:\nl
“O child, in the magnificence of thy soul\nl
Dwelling on the border of a greater world\nl
And dazzled by thy superhuman thoughts,\nl
Thou lendst eternity to a mortal hope.\nl
Here on this mutable and ignorant earth\nl
Page 432

Who is the lover and who is the friend?\nl
All passes here, nothing remains the same.\nl
None is for any on this transient globe.\nl
He whom thou lovest now, a stranger came\nl
And into a far strangeness shall depart:\nl
His moment's part once done upon life's stage\nl
Which for a time was given him from within,\nl
To other scenes he moves and other players\nl
And laughs and weeps mid faces new, unknown.\nl
The body thou hast loved is cast away\nl
Amidst the brute unchanging stuff of worlds\nl
To indifferent mighty Nature and becomes\nl
Crude matter for the joy of others' lives.\nl
But for our souls, upon the wheel of God\nl
For ever turning, they arrive and go,\nl
Married and sundered in the magic round\nl
Of the great Dancer of the boundless dance.\nl
Our emotions are but high and dying notes\nl
Of his wild music changed compellingly\nl
By the passionate movements of a seeking Heart\nl
In the inconstant links of hour with hour.\nl
To call down heaven's distant answering song,\nl
To cry to an unseized bliss is all we dare;\nl
Once seized, we lose the heavenly music's sense;\nl
Too near, the rhythmic cry has fled or failed;\nl
All sweetnesses are baffling symbols here.\nl
Love dies before the lover in our breast:\nl
Our joys are perfumes in a brittle vase.\nl
O then what wreck is this upon Time's sea\nl
To spread life's sails to the hurricane desire\nl
And call for pilot the unseeing heart!\nl
O child, wilt thou proclaim, wilt thou then follow\nl
Against the Law that is the eternal will\nl
The autarchy of the rash Titan's mood\nl
To whom his own fierce will is the one law\nl
In a world where Truth is not, nor Light nor God?\nl
Page 433

Only the gods can speak what now thou speakst.\nl
Thou who art human, think not like a god.\nl
For man, below the god, above the brute,\nl
Is given the calm reason as his guide;\nl
He is not driven by an unthinking will\nl
As are the actions of the bird and beast;\nl
He is not moved by stark Necessity\nl
Like the senseless motion of inconscient things.\nl
The giant's and the Titan's furious march\nl
Climbs to usurp the kingdom of the gods\nl
Or skirts the demon magnitudes of Hell;\nl
In the unreflecting passion of their hearts\nl
They dash their lives against the eternal Law\nl
And fall and break by their own violent mass:\nl
The middle path is made for thinking man.\nl
To choose his steps by reason's vigilant light,\nl
To choose his path among the many paths\nl
Is given him, for each his difficult goal\nl
Hewn out of infinite possibility.\nl
Leave not thy goal to follow a beautiful face.\nl
Only when thou hast climbed above thy mind\nl
And liv'st in the calm vastness of the One\nl
Can love be eternal in the eternal Bliss\nl
And love divine replace the human tie.\nl
There is a shrouded law, an austere force:\nl
It bids thee strengthen thy undying spirit;\nl
It offers its severe benignancies\nl
Of work and thought and measured grave delight\nl
As steps to climb to God's far secret heights.\nl
Then is our life a tranquil pilgrimage,\nl
Each year a mile upon the heavenly Way,\nl
Each dawn opens into a larger Light.\nl
Thy acts are thy helpers, all events are signs,\nl
Waking and sleep are opportunities\nl
Given to thee by an immortal Power.\nl
So canst thou raise thy pure unvanquished spirit,\nl
Page 434

Till spread to heaven in a wide vesper calm,\nl
Indifferent and gentle as the sky,\nl
It greatens slowly into timeless peace.”\nl
But Savitri replied with steadfast eyes:\nl
“My will is part of the eternal Will,\nl
My fate is what my spirit's strength can make,\nl
My fate is what my spirit's strength can bear;\nl
My strength is not the Titan's; it is God's.\nl
I have discovered my glad reality\nl
Beyond my body in another's being:\nl
I have found the deep unchanging soul of love.\nl
Then how shall I desire a lonely good,\nl
Or slay, aspiring to white vacant peace,\nl
The endless hope that made my soul spring forth\nl
Out of its infinite solitude and sleep?\nl
My spirit has glimpsed the glory for which it came,\nl
The beating of one vast heart in the flame of things,\nl
My eternity clasped by his eternity\nl
And, tireless of the sweet abysms of Time,\nl
Deep possibility always to love.\nl
This, this is first, last joy and to its throb\nl
The riches of a thousand fortunate years\nl
Are poverty. Nothing to me are death and grief\nl
Or ordinary lives and happy days.\nl
And what to me are common souls of men\nl
Or eyes and lips that are not Satyavan's?\nl
I have no need to draw back from his arms\nl
And the discovered paradise of his love\nl
And journey into a still infinity.\nl
Only now for my soul in Satyavan\nl
I treasure the rich occasion of my birth:\nl
In sunlight and a dream of emerald ways\nl
I shall walk with him like gods in Paradise.\nl
If for a year, that year is all my life.\nl
And yet I know this is not all my fate\nl
Only to live and love awhile and die.\nl
Page 435

For I know now why my spirit came on earth\nl
And who I am and who he is I love.\nl
I have looked at him from my immortal Self,\nl
I have seen God smile at me in Satyavan;\nl
I have seen the Eternal in a human face.”\nl
Then none could answer to her words. Silent\nl
They sat and looked into the eyes of Fate.\nl

\ht Canto Two: The Way of Fate and the Problem of Pain
\par
\sbigcap A silence sealed the irrevocable decree,\nl
The word of Fate that fell from heavenly lips\nl
Fixing a doom no power could ever reverse\nl
Unless heaven's will itself could change its course.\nl
Or so it seemed: yet from the silence rose\nl
One voice that questioned changeless destiny,\nl
A will that strove against the immutable Will.\nl
A mother's heart had heard the fateful speech\nl
That rang like a sanction to the call of death\nl
And came like a chill close to life and hope.\nl
Yet hope sank down like an extinguished fire.\nl
She felt the leaden inevitable hand\nl
Invade the secrecy of her guarded soul\nl
And smite with sudden pain its still content\nl
And the empire of her hard-won quietude.\nl
Awhile she fell to the level of human mind,\nl
A field of mortal grief and Nature's law;\nl
She shared, she bore the common lot of men\nl
And felt what common hearts endure in Time.\nl
Voicing earth's question to the inscrutable power\nl
The queen now turned to the still immobile seer:\nl
Assailed by the discontent in Nature's depths,\nl
Partner in the agony of dumb driven things\nl
And all the misery, all the ignorant cry,\nl
Passionate like sorrow questioning heaven she spoke.\nl
Lending her speech to the surface soul on earth\nl
She uttered the suffering in the world's dumb heart\nl
And man's revolt against his ignorant fate.\nl
“O seer, in the earth's strange twi-natured life\nl
By what pitiless adverse Necessity\nl
Or what cold freak of a Creator's will,\nl
Page 437

By what random accident or governed Chance\nl
That shaped a rule out of fortuitous steps,\nl
Made destiny from an hour's emotion, came\nl
Into the unreadable mystery of Time\nl
The direr mystery of grief and pain?\nl
Is it thy God who made this cruel law?\nl
Or some disastrous Power has marred his work\nl
And he stands helpless to defend or save?\nl
A fatal seed was sown in life's false start\nl
When evil twinned with good on earthly soil.\nl
Then first appeared the malady of mind,\nl
Its pang of thought, its quest for the aim of life.\nl
It twisted into forms of good and ill\nl
The frank simplicity of the animal's acts;\nl
It turned the straight path hewn by the body's gods,\nl
Followed the zigzag of the uncertain course\nl
Of life that wanders seeking for its aim\nl
In the pale starlight falling from thought's skies,\nl
Its guides the unsure idea, the wavering will.\nl
Lost was the instinct's safe identity\nl
With the arrow-point of being's inmost sight,\nl
Marred the sure steps of Nature's simple walk\nl
And truth and freedom in the growing soul.\nl
Out of some ageless innocence and peace,\nl
Privilege of souls not yet betrayed to birth,\nl
Cast down to suffer on this hard dangerous earth\nl
Our life was born in pain and with a cry.\nl
Although earth-nature welcomes heaven's breath\nl
Inspiring Matter with the will to live,\nl
A thousand ills assail the mortal's hours\nl
And wear away the natural joy of life;\nl
Our bodies are an engine cunningly made,\nl
But for all its parts as cunningly are planned,\nl
Contrived ingeniously with demon skill,\nl
Its apt inevitable heritage\nl
Of mortal danger and peculiar pain,\nl
Page 438

Its payment of the tax of Time and Fate,\nl
Its way to suffer and its way to die.\nl
This is the ransom of our high estate,\nl
The sign and stamp of our humanity.\nl
A grisly company of maladies\nl
Come, licensed lodgers, into man's bodily house,\nl
Purveyors of death and torturers of life.\nl
In the malignant hollows of the world,\nl
In its subconscient cavern-passages\nl
Ambushed they lie waiting their hour to leap,\nl
Surrounding with danger the sieged city of life:\nl
Admitted into the citadel of man's days\nl
They mine his force and maim or suddenly kill.\nl
Ourselves within us lethal forces nurse;\nl
We make of our own enemies our guests:\nl
Out of their holes like beasts they creep and gnaw\nl
The chords of the divine musician's lyre\nl
Till frayed and thin the music dies away\nl
Or crashing snaps with a last tragic note.\nl
All that we are is like a fort beset:\nl
All that we strive to be alters like a dream\nl
In the grey sleep of Matter's ignorance.\nl
Mind suffers lamed by the world's disharmony\nl
And the unloveliness of human things.\nl
A treasure misspent or cheaply, fruitlessly sold\nl
In the bazaar of a blind destiny,\nl
A gift of priceless value from Time's gods\nl
Lost or mislaid in an uncaring world,\nl
Life is a marvel missed, an art gone wry;\nl
A seeker in a dark and obscure place,\nl
An ill-armed warrior facing dreadful odds,\nl
An imperfect worker given a baffling task,\nl
An ignorant judge of problems Ignorance made,\nl
Its heavenward flights reach closed and keyless gates,\nl
Its glorious outbursts peter out in mire.\nl
On Nature's gifts to man a curse was laid:\nl
Page 439

All walks inarmed by its own opposites,\nl
Error is the comrade of our mortal thought\nl
And falsehood lurks in the deep bosom of truth,\nl
Sin poisons with its vivid flowers of joy\nl
Or leaves a red scar burnt across the soul;\nl
Virtue is a grey bondage and a gaol.\nl
At every step is laid for us a snare.\nl
Alien to reason and the spirit's light,\nl
Our fount of action from a darkness wells;\nl
In ignorance and nescience are our roots.\nl
A growing register of calamities\nl
Is the past's account, the future's book of Fate:\nl
The centuries pile man's follies and man's crimes\nl
Upon the countless crowd of Nature's ills;\nl
As if the world's stone load was not enough,\nl
A crop of miseries obstinately is sown\nl
By his own hand in the furrows of the gods,\nl
The vast increasing tragic harvest reaped\nl
From old misdeeds buried by oblivious Time.\nl
He walks by his own choice into Hell's trap;\nl
This mortal creature is his own worst foe.\nl
His science is an artificer of doom;\nl
He ransacks earth for means to harm his kind;\nl
He slays his happiness and others' good.\nl
Nothing has he learned from Time and its history;\nl
Even as of old in the raw youth of Time,\nl
When Earth ignorant ran on the highways of Fate,\nl
Old forms of evil cling to the world's soul:\nl
War making nought the sweet smiling calm of life,\nl
Battle and rapine, ruin and massacre\nl
Are still the fierce pastimes of man's warring tribes;\nl
An idiot hour destroys what centuries made,\nl
His wanton rage or frenzied hate lays low\nl
The beauty and greatness by his genius wrought\nl
And the mighty output of a nation's toil.\nl
All he has achieved he drags to the precipice.\nl
Page 440

His grandeur he turns to an epic of doom and fall;\nl
His littleness crawls content through squalor and mud,\nl
He calls heaven's retribution on his head\nl
And wallows in his self-made misery.\nl
A part author of the cosmic tragedy,\nl
His will conspires with death and time and fate.\nl
His brief appearance on the enigmaed earth\nl
Ever recurs but brings no high result\nl
To this wanderer through the aeon-rings of God\nl
That shut his life in their vast longevity.\nl
His soul's wide search and ever returning hopes\nl
Pursue the useless orbit of their course\nl
In a vain repetition of lost toils\nl
Across a track of soon forgotten lives.\nl
All is an episode in a meaningless tale.\nl
Why is it all and wherefore are we here?\nl
If to some being of eternal bliss\nl
It is our spirit's destiny to return\nl
Or some still impersonal height of endless calm,\nl
Since That we are and out of That we came,\nl
Whence rose the strange and sterile interlude\nl
Lasting in vain through interminable Time?\nl
Who willed to form or feign a universe\nl
In the cold and endless emptiness of Space?\nl
Or if these beings must be and their brief lives,\nl
What need had the soul of ignorance and tears?\nl
Whence rose the call for sorrow and for pain?\nl
Or all came helplessly without a cause?\nl
What power forced the immortal spirit to birth?\nl
The eternal witness once of eternity,\nl
A deathless sojourner mid transient scenes,\nl
He camps in life's half-lit obscurity\nl
Amid the debris of his thoughts and dreams.\nl
Or who persuaded it to fall from bliss\nl
And forfeit its immortal privilege?\nl
Who laid on it the ceaseless will to live\nl
Page 441

A wanderer in this beautiful, sorrowful world,\nl
And bear its load of joy and grief and love?\nl
Or if no being watches the works of Time,\nl
What hard impersonal Necessity\nl
Compels the vain toil of brief living things?\nl
A great Illusion then has built the stars.\nl
But where then is the soul's security,\nl
Its poise in this circling of unreal suns?\nl
Or else it is a wanderer from its home\nl
Who strayed into a blind alley of Time and chance\nl
And finds no issue from a meaningless world.\nl
Or where begins and ends Illusion's reign?\nl
Perhaps the soul we feel is only a dream,\nl
Eternal self a fiction sensed in trance.”\nl

\spar Then after a silence Narad made reply:\nl
Tuning his lips to earthly sound he spoke,\nl
And something now of the deep sense of fate\nl
Weighted the fragile hints of mortal speech.\nl
His forehead shone with vision solemnised,\nl
Turned to a tablet of supernal thoughts\nl
As if characters of an unwritten tongue\nl
Had left in its breadth the inscriptions of the gods.\nl
Bare in that light Time toiled, his unseen works\nl
Detected; the broad-flung far-seeing schemes\nl
Unfinished which his aeoned flight unrolls\nl
Were mapped already in that world-wide look.\nl
“Was then the sun a dream because there is night?\nl
Hidden in the mortal's heart the Eternal lives:\nl
He lives secret in the chamber of thy soul,\nl
A Light shines there nor pain nor grief can cross.\nl
A darkness stands between thyself and him,\nl
Thou canst not hear or feel the marvellous Guest,\nl
Thou canst not see the beatific sun.\nl
O queen, thy thought is a light of the Ignorance,\nl
Its brilliant curtain hides from thee God's face.\nl
Page 442

It illumes a world born from the Inconscience\nl
But hides the Immortal's meaning in the world.\nl
Thy mind's light hides from thee the Eternal's thought,\nl
Thy heart's hopes hide from thee the Eternal's will,\nl
Earth's joys shut from thee the Immortal's bliss.\nl
Thence rose the need of a dark intruding god,\nl
The world's dread teacher, the creator, pain.\nl
Where Ignorance is, there suffering too must come;\nl
Thy grief is a cry of darkness to the Light;\nl
Pain was the first-born of the Inconscience\nl
Which was thy body's dumb original base;\nl
Already slept there pain's subconscient shape:\nl
A shadow in a shadowy tenebrous womb,\nl
Till life shall move, it waits to wake and be.\nl
In one caul with joy came forth the dreadful Power.\nl
In life's breast it was born hiding its twin;\nl
But pain came first, then only joy could be.\nl
Pain ploughed the first hard ground of the world-drowse.\nl
By pain a spirit started from the clod,\nl
By pain Life stirred in the subliminal deep.\nl
Interned, submerged, hidden in Matter's trance\nl
Awoke to itself the dreamer, sleeping Mind;\nl
It made a visible realm out of its dreams,\nl
It drew its shapes from the subconscient depths,\nl
Then turned to look upon the world it had made.\nl
By pain and joy, the bright and tenebrous twins,\nl
The inanimate world perceived its sentient soul,\nl
Else had the Inconscient never suffered change.\nl
Pain is the hammer of the Gods to break\nl
A dead resistance in the mortal's heart,\nl
His slow inertia as of living stone.\nl
If the heart were not forced to want and weep,\nl
His soul would have lain down content, at ease,\nl
And never thought to exceed the human start\nl
And never learned to climb towards the Sun.\nl
This earth is full of labour, packed with pain;\nl
Page 443

Throes of an endless birth coerce her still;\nl
The centuries end, the ages vainly pass\nl
And yet the Godhead in her is not born.\nl
The ancient Mother faces all with joy,\nl
Calls for the ardent pang, the grandiose thrill;\nl
For with pain and labour all creation comes.\nl
This earth is full of the anguish of the gods;\nl
Ever they travail driven by Time's goad,\nl
And strive to work out the eternal Will\nl
And shape the life divine in mortal forms.\nl
His will must be worked out in human breasts\nl
Against the Evil that rises from the gulfs,\nl
Against the world's Ignorance and its obstinate strength,\nl
Against the stumblings of man's pervert will,\nl
Against the deep folly of his human mind,\nl
Against the blind reluctance of his heart.\nl
The spirit is doomed to pain till man is free.\nl
There is a clamour of battle, a tramp, a march:\nl
A cry arises like a moaning sea,\nl
A desperate laughter under the blows of death,\nl
A doom of blood and sweat and toil and tears.\nl
Men die that man may live and God be born.\nl
An awful Silence watches tragic Time.\nl
Pain is the hand of Nature sculpturing men\nl
To greatness: an inspired labour chisels\nl
With heavenly cruelty an unwilling mould.\nl
Implacable in the passion of their will,\nl
Lifting the hammers of titanic toil\nl
The demiurges of the universe work;\nl
They shape with giant strokes their own; their sons\nl
Are marked with their enormous stamp of fire.\nl
Although the shaping god's tremendous touch\nl
Is torture unbearable to mortal nerves,\nl
The fiery spirit grows in strength within\nl
And feels a joy in every titan pang.\nl
He who would save himself lives bare and calm;\nl
Page 444

He who would save the race must share its pain:\nl
This he shall know who obeys that grandiose urge.\nl
The Great who came to save this suffering world\nl
And rescue out of Time's shadow and the Law,\nl
Must pass beneath the yoke of grief and pain;\nl
They are caught by the Wheel that they had hoped to break,\nl
On their shoulders they must bear man's load of fate.\nl
Heaven's riches they bring, their sufferings count the price\nl
Or they pay the gift of knowledge with their lives.\nl
The Son of God born as the Son of man\nl
Has drunk the bitter cup, owned Godhead's debt,\nl
The debt the Eternal owes to the fallen kind\nl
His will has bound to death and struggling life\nl
That yearns in vain for rest and endless peace.\nl
Now is the debt paid, wiped off the original score.\nl
The Eternal suffers in a human form,\nl
He has signed salvation's testament with his blood:\nl
He has opened the doors of his undying peace.\nl
The Deity compensates the creature's claim,\nl
The Creator bears the law of pain and death;\nl
A retribution smites the incarnate God.\nl
His love has paved the mortal's road to Heaven:\nl
He has given his life and light to balance here\nl
The dark account of mortal ignorance.\nl
It is finished, the dread mysterious sacrifice,\nl
Offered by God's martyred body for the world;\nl
Gethsemane and Calvary are his lot,\nl
He carries the cross on which man's soul is nailed;\nl
His escort is the curses of the crowd;\nl
Insult and jeer are his right's acknowledgment;\nl
Two thieves slain with him mock his mighty death.\nl
He has trod with bleeding brow the Saviour's way.\nl
He who has found his identity with God\nl
Pays with the body's death his soul's vast light.\nl
His knowledge immortal triumphs by his death.\nl
Hewn, quartered on the scaffold as he falls,\nl
Page 445

His crucified voice proclaims, `I, I am God;'\nl
`Yes, all is God,' peals back Heaven's deathless call.\nl
The seed of Godhead sleeps in mortal hearts,\nl
The flower of Godhead grows on the world-tree:\nl
All shall discover God in self and things.\nl
But when God's messenger comes to help the world\nl
And lead the soul of earth to higher things,\nl
He too must carry the yoke he came to unloose;\nl
He too must bear the pang that he would heal:\nl
Exempt and unafflicted by earth's fate,\nl
How shall he cure the ills he never felt?\nl
He covers the world's agony with his calm;\nl
But though to the outward eye no sign appears\nl
And peace is given to our torn human hearts,\nl
The struggle is there and paid the unseen price;\nl
The fire, the strife, the wrestle are within.\nl
He carries the suffering world in his own breast;\nl
Its sins weigh on his thoughts, its grief is his:\nl
Earth's ancient load lies heavy on his soul;\nl
Night and its powers beleaguer his tardy steps,\nl
The Titan adversary's clutch he bears;\nl
His march is a battle and a pilgrimage.\nl
Life's evil smites, he is stricken with the world's pain:\nl
A million wounds gape in his secret heart.\nl
He journeys sleepless through an unending night;\nl
Antagonist forces crowd across his path;\nl
A siege, a combat is his inner life.\nl
Even worse may be the cost, direr the pain:\nl
His large identity and all-harbouring love\nl
Shall bring the cosmic anguish into his depths,\nl
The sorrow of all living things shall come\nl
And knock at his doors and live within his house;\nl
A dreadful cord of sympathy can tie\nl
All suffering into his single grief and make\nl
All agony in all the worlds his own.\nl
He meets an ancient adversary Force,\nl
Page 446

He is lashed with the whips that tear the world's worn heart;\nl
The weeping of the centuries visits his eyes:\nl
He wears the blood-glued fiery Centaur shirt,\nl
The poison of the world has stained his throat.\nl
In the market-place of Matter's capital\nl
Amidst the chafferings of the affair called life\nl
He is tied to the stake of a perennial Fire;\nl
He burns on an unseen original verge\nl
That Matter may be turned to spirit stuff:\nl
He is the victim in his own sacrifice.\nl
The Immortal bound to earth's mortality\nl
Appearing and perishing on the roads of Time\nl
Creates God's moment by eternity's beats.\nl
He dies that the world may be new-born and live.\nl
Even if he escapes the fiercest fires,\nl
Even if the world breaks not in, a drowning sea,\nl
Only by hard sacrifice is high heaven earned:\nl
He must face the fight, the pang who would conquer Hell.\nl
A dark concealed hostility is lodged\nl
In the human depths, in the hidden heart of Time\nl
That claims the right to change and mar God's work.\nl
A secret enmity ambushes the world's march;\nl
It leaves a mark on thought and speech and act:\nl
It stamps stain and defect on all things done;\nl
Till it is slain peace is forbidden on earth.\nl
There is no visible foe, but the unseen\nl
Is round us, forces intangible besiege,\nl
Touches from alien realms, thoughts not our own\nl
Overtake us and compel the erring heart;\nl
Our lives are caught in an ambiguous net.\nl
An adversary Force was born of old:\nl
Invader of the life of mortal man,\nl
It hides from him the straight immortal path.\nl
A power came in to veil the eternal Light,\nl
A power opposed to the eternal will\nl
Diverts the messages of the infallible Word,\nl
Page 447

Contorts the contours of the cosmic plan:\nl
A whisper lures to evil the human heart,\nl
It seals up wisdom's eyes, the soul's regard,\nl
It is the origin of our suffering here,\nl
It binds earth to calamity and pain.\nl
This all must conquer who would bring down God's peace.\nl
This hidden foe lodged in the human breast\nl
Man must overcome or miss his higher fate.\nl
This is the inner war without escape.\nl

\spar “Hard is the world-redeemer's heavy task;\nl
The world itself becomes his adversary,\nl
Those he would save are his antagonists:\nl
This world is in love with its own ignorance,\nl
Its darkness turns away from the saviour light,\nl
It gives the cross in payment for the crown.\nl
His work is a trickle of splendour in a long night;\nl
He sees the long march of Time, the little won;\nl
A few are saved, the rest strive on and fail:\nl
A Sun has passed, on earth Night's shadow falls.\nl
Yes, there are happy ways near to God's sun;\nl
But few are they who tread the sunlit path;\nl
Only the pure in soul can walk in light.\nl
An exit is shown, a road of hard escape\nl
From the sorrow and the darkness and the chain;\nl
But how shall a few escaped release the world?\nl
The human mass lingers beneath the yoke.\nl
Escape, however high, redeems not life,\nl
Life that is left behind on a fallen earth.\nl
Escape cannot uplift the abandoned race\nl
Or bring to it victory and the reign of God.\nl
A greater power must come, a larger light.\nl
Although Light grows on earth and Night recedes,\nl
Yet till the evil is slain in its own home\nl
And Light invades the world's inconscient base\nl
And perished has the adversary Force,\nl
Page 448

He still must labour on, his work half done.\nl
One yet may come armoured, invincible;\nl
His will immobile meets the mobile hour;\nl
The world's blows cannot bend that victor head;\nl
Calm and sure are his steps in the growing Night;\nl
The goal recedes, he hurries not his pace,\nl
He turns not to high voices in the night;\nl
He asks no aid from the inferior gods;\nl
His eyes are fixed on his immutable aim.\nl
Man turns aside or chooses easier paths;\nl
He keeps to the one high and difficult road\nl
That sole can climb to the Eternal's peaks;\nl
The ineffable planes already have felt his tread;\nl
He has made heaven and earth his instruments,\nl
But the limits fall from him of earth and heaven;\nl
Their law he transcends but uses as his means.\nl
He has seized life's hands, he has mastered his own heart.\nl
The feints of Nature mislead not his sight,\nl
Inflexible his look towards Truth's far end;\nl
Fate's deaf resistance cannot break his will.\nl
In the dreadful passages, the fatal paths,\nl
Invulnerable his soul, his heart unslain,\nl
He lives through the opposition of earth's Powers\nl
And Nature's ambushes and the world's attacks.\nl
His spirit's stature transcending pain and bliss,\nl
He fronts evil and good with calm and equal eyes.\nl
He too must grapple with the riddling Sphinx\nl
And plunge into her long obscurity.\nl
He has broken into the Inconscient's depths\nl
That veil themselves even from their own regard:\nl
He has seen God's slumber shape these magic worlds.\nl
He has watched the dumb God fashioning Matter's frame,\nl
Dreaming the dreams of its unknowing sleep,\nl
And watched the unconscious Force that built the stars.\nl
He has learned the Inconscient's workings and its law,\nl
Its incoherent thoughts and rigid acts,\nl
Page 449

Its hazard wastes of impulse and idea,\nl
The chaos of its mechanic frequencies,\nl
Its random calls, its whispers falsely true,\nl
Misleaders of the hooded listening soul.\nl
All things come to its ear but nothing abides;\nl
All rose from the silence, all goes back to its hush.\nl
Its somnolence founded the universe,\nl
Its obscure waking makes the world seem vain.\nl
Arisen from Nothingness and towards Nothingness turned,\nl
Its dark and potent nescience was earth's start;\nl
It is the waste stuff from which all was made;\nl
Into its deeps creation can collapse.\nl
Its opposition clogs the march of the soul,\nl
It is the mother of our ignorance.\nl
He must call light into its dark abysms,\nl
Else never can Truth conquer Matter's sleep\nl
And all earth look into the eyes of God.\nl
All things obscure his knowledge must relume,\nl
All things perverse his power must unknot:\nl
He must pass to the other shore of falsehood's sea,\nl
He must enter the world's dark to bring there light.\nl
The heart of evil must be bared to his eyes,\nl
He must learn its cosmic dark necessity,\nl
Its right and its dire roots in Nature's soil.\nl
He must know the thought that moves the demon act\nl
And justifies the Titan's erring pride\nl
And the falsehood lurking in earth's crooked dreams:\nl
He must enter the eternity of Night\nl
And know God's darkness as he knows his Sun.\nl
For this he must go down into the pit,\nl
For this he must invade the dolorous Vasts.\nl
Imperishable and wise and infinite,\nl
He still must travel Hell the world to save.\nl
Into the eternal Light he shall emerge\nl
On borders of the meeting of all worlds;\nl
There on the verge of Nature's summit steps\nl
Page 450

The secret Law of each thing is fulfilled,\nl
All contraries heal their long dissidence.\nl
There meet and clasp the eternal opposites,\nl
There pain becomes a violent fiery joy;\nl
Evil turns back to its original good,\nl
And sorrow lies upon the breasts of Bliss:\nl
She has learned to weep glad tears of happiness;\nl
Her gaze is charged with a wistful ecstasy.\nl
Then shall be ended here the Law of Pain.\nl
Earth shall be made a home of Heaven's light,\nl
A seer heaven-born shall lodge in human breasts;\nl
The superconscient beam shall touch men's eyes\nl
And the truth-conscious world come down to earth\nl
Invading Matter with the Spirit's ray,\nl
Awaking its silence to immortal thoughts,\nl
Awaking the dumb heart to the living Word.\nl
This mortal life shall house Eternity's bliss,\nl
The body's self taste immortality.\nl
Then shall the world-redeemer's task be done.\nl

\spar “Till then must life carry its seed of death\nl
And sorrow's plaint be heard in the slow Night.\nl
O mortal, bear this great world's law of pain,\nl
In thy hard passage through a suffering world\nl
Lean for thy soul's support on Heaven's strength,\nl
Turn towards high Truth, aspire to love and peace.\nl
A little bliss is lent thee from above,\nl
A touch divine upon thy human days.\nl
Make of thy daily way a pilgrimage,\nl
For through small joys and griefs thou mov'st towards God.\nl
Haste not towards Godhead on a dangerous road,\nl
Open not thy doorways to a nameless Power,\nl
Climb not to Godhead by the Titan's road.\nl
Against the Law he pits his single will,\nl
Across its way he throws his pride of might.\nl
Heavenward he clambers on a stair of storms\nl
Page 451

Aspiring to live near the deathless sun.\nl
He strives with a giant strength to wrest by force\nl
From life and Nature the immortals' right;\nl
He takes by storm the world and fate and heaven.\nl
He comes not to the high World-maker's seat,\nl
He waits not for the outstretched hand of God\nl
To raise him out of his mortality.\nl
All he would make his own, leave nothing free,\nl
Stretching his small self to cope with the infinite.\nl
Obstructing the gods' open ways he makes\nl
His own estate of the earth's air and light;\nl
A monopolist of the world-energy,\nl
He dominates the life of common men.\nl
His pain and others' pain he makes his means:\nl
On death and suffering he builds his throne.\nl
In the hurry and clangour of his acts of might,\nl
In a riot and excess of fame and shame,\nl
By his magnitudes of hate and violence,\nl
By the quaking of the world beneath his tread\nl
He matches himself against the Eternal's calm\nl
And feels in himself the greatness of a god:\nl
Power is his image of celestial self.\nl
The Titan's heart is a sea of fire and force;\nl
He exults in the death of things and ruin and fall,\nl
He feeds his strength with his own and others' pain;\nl
In the world's pathos and passion he takes delight,\nl
His pride, his might call for the struggle and pang.\nl
He glories in the sufferings of the flesh\nl
And covers the stigmata with the Stoic's name.\nl
His eyes blinded and visionless stare at the sun,\nl
The seeker's Sight receding from his heart\nl
Can find no more the light of eternity;\nl
He sees the beyond as an emptiness void of soul\nl
And takes his night for a dark infinite.\nl
His nature magnifies the unreal's blank\nl
And sees in Nought the sole reality:\nl
Page 452

He would stamp his single figure on the world,\nl
Obsess the world's rumours with his single name.\nl
His moments centre the vast universe.\nl
He sees his little self as very God.\nl
His little `I' has swallowed the whole world,\nl
His ego has stretched into infinity.\nl
His mind, a beat in original Nothingness,\nl
Ciphers his thought on a slate of hourless Time.\nl
He builds on a mighty vacancy of soul\nl
A huge philosophy of Nothingness.\nl
In him Nirvana lives and speaks and acts\nl
Impossibly creating a universe.\nl
An eternal zero is his formless self,\nl
His spirit the void impersonal absolute.\nl
Take not that stride, O growing soul of man;\nl
Cast not thy self into that night of God.\nl
The soul suffering is not eternity's key,\nl
Or ransom by sorrow heaven's demand on life.\nl
O mortal, bear, but ask not for the stroke,\nl
Too soon will grief and anguish find thee out.\nl
Too enormous is that venture for thy will;\nl
Only in limits can man's strength be safe;\nl
Yet is infinity thy spirit's goal;\nl
Its bliss is there behind the world's face of tears.\nl
A power is in thee that thou knowest not;\nl
Thou art a vessel of the imprisoned spark.\nl
It seeks relief from Time's envelopment,\nl
And while thou shutst it in, the seal is pain:\nl
Bliss is the Godhead's crown, eternal, free,\nl
Unburdened by life's blind mystery of pain:\nl
Pain is the signature of the Ignorance\nl
Attesting the secret god denied by life:\nl
Until life finds him pain can never end.\nl
Calm is self's victory overcoming fate.\nl
Bear; thou shalt find at last thy road to bliss.\nl
Bliss is the secret stuff of all that lives,\nl
Page 453

Even pain and grief are garbs of world-delight,\nl
It hides behind thy sorrow and thy cry.\nl
Because thy strength is a part and not God's whole,\nl
Because afflicted by the little self\nl
Thy consciousness forgets to be divine\nl
As it walks in the vague penumbra of the flesh\nl
And cannot bear the world's tremendous touch,\nl
Thou criest out and sayst that there is pain.\nl
Indifference, pain and joy, a triple disguise,\nl
Attire of the rapturous Dancer in the ways,\nl
Withhold from thee the body of God's bliss.\nl
Thy spirit's strength shall make thee one with God,\nl
Thy agony shall change to ecstasy,\nl
Indifference deepen into infinity's calm\nl
And joy laugh nude on the peaks of the Absolute.\nl

\spar “O mortal who complainst of death and fate,\nl
Accuse none of the harms thyself hast called;\nl
This troubled world thou hast chosen for thy home,\nl
Thou art thyself the author of thy pain.\nl
Once in the immortal boundlessness of Self,\nl
In a vast of Truth and Consciousness and Light\nl
The soul looked out from its felicity.\nl
It felt the Spirit's interminable bliss,\nl
It knew itself deathless, timeless, spaceless, one,\nl
It saw the Eternal, lived in the Infinite.\nl
Then, curious of a shadow thrown by Truth,\nl
It strained towards some otherness of self,\nl
It was drawn to an unknown Face peering through night.\nl
It sensed a negative infinity,\nl
A void supernal whose immense excess\nl
Imitating God and everlasting Time\nl
Offered a ground for Nature's adverse birth\nl
And Matter's rigid hard unconsciousness\nl
Harbouring the brilliance of a transient soul\nl
That lights up birth and death and ignorant life.\nl
Page 454

A Mind arose that stared at Nothingness\nl
Till figures formed of what could never be;\nl
It housed the contrary of all that is.\nl
A Nought appeared as Being's huge sealed cause,\nl
Its dumb support in a blank infinite,\nl
In whose abysm spirit must disappear:\nl
A darkened Nature lived and held the seed\nl
Of Spirit hidden and feigning not to be.\nl
Eternal Consciousness became a freak\nl
Of an unsouled almighty Inconscient\nl
And, breathed no more as spirit's native air,\nl
Bliss was an incident of a mortal hour,\nl
A stranger in the insentient universe.\nl
As one drawn by the grandeur of the Void\nl
The soul attracted leaned to the Abyss:\nl
It longed for the adventure of Ignorance\nl
And the marvel and surprise of the Unknown\nl
And the endless possibility that lurked\nl
In the womb of Chaos and in Nothing's gulf\nl
Or looked from the unfathomed eyes of Chance.\nl
It tired of its unchanging happiness,\nl
It turned away from immortality:\nl
It was drawn to hazard's call and danger's charm,\nl
It yearned to the pathos of grief, the drama of pain,\nl
Perdition's peril, the wounded bare escape,\nl
The music of ruin and its glamour and crash,\nl
The savour of pity and the gamble of love\nl
And passion and the ambiguous face of Fate.\nl
A world of hard endeavour and difficult toil,\nl
And battle on extinction's perilous verge,\nl
A clash of forces, a vast incertitude,\nl
The joy of creation out of Nothingness,\nl
Strange meetings on the roads of Ignorance\nl
And the companionship of half-known souls\nl
Or the solitary greatness and lonely force\nl
Of a separate being conquering its world,\nl
Page 455

Called it from its too safe eternity.\nl
A huge descent began, a giant fall:\nl
For what the spirit sees, creates a truth\nl
And what the soul imagines is made a world.\nl
A Thought that leaped from the Timeless can become,\nl
Indicator of cosmic consequence\nl
And the itinerary of the gods,\nl
A cyclic movement in eternal Time.\nl
Thus came, born from a blind tremendous choice,\nl
This great perplexed and discontented world,\nl
This haunt of Ignorance, this home of Pain:\nl
There are pitched desire's tents, grief's headquarters.\nl
A vast disguise conceals the Eternal's bliss.”\nl

\spar Then Aswapati answered to the seer:\nl
“Is then the spirit ruled by an outward world?\nl
O seer, is there no remedy within?\nl
But what is Fate if not the spirit's will\nl
After long time fulfilled by cosmic Force?\nl
I deemed a mighty Power had come with her;\nl
Is not that Power the high compeer of Fate?”\nl
But Narad answered covering truth with truth:\nl
“O Aswapati, random seem the ways\nl
Along whose banks your footsteps stray or run\nl
In casual hours or moments of the gods,\nl
Yet your least stumblings are foreseen above.\nl
Infallibly the curves of life are drawn\nl
Following the stream of Time through the unknown;\nl
They are led by a clue the calm immortals keep.\nl
This blazoned hieroglyph of prophet morns\nl
A meaning more sublime in symbols writes\nl
Than sealed Thought wakes to, but of this high script\nl
How shall my voice convince the mind of earth?\nl
Heaven's wiser love rejects the mortal's prayer;\nl
Unblinded by the breath of his desire,\nl
Unclouded by the mists of fear and hope,\nl
Page 456

It bends above the strife of love with death;\nl
It keeps for her her privilege of pain.\nl
A greatness in thy daughter's soul resides\nl
That can transform herself and all around\nl
But must cross on stones of suffering to its goal.\nl
Although designed like a nectar cup of heaven,\nl
Of heavenly ether made she sought this air,\nl
She too must share the human need of grief\nl
And all her cause of joy transmute to pain.\nl
The mind of mortal man is led by words,\nl
His sight retires behind the walls of Thought\nl
And looks out only through half-opened doors.\nl
He cuts the boundless Truth into sky-strips\nl
And every strip he takes for all the heavens.\nl
He stares at infinite possibility\nl
And gives to the plastic Vast the name of Chance;\nl
He sees the long results of an all-wise Force\nl
Planning a sequence of steps in endless Time\nl
But in its links imagines a senseless chain\nl
Or the dead hand of cold Necessity;\nl
He answers not to the mystic Mother's heart,\nl
Misses the ardent heavings of her breast\nl
And feels cold rigid limbs of lifeless Law.\nl
The will of the Timeless working out in Time\nl
In the free absolute steps of cosmic Truth\nl
He thinks a dead machine or unconscious Fate.\nl
A Magician's formulas have made Matter's laws\nl
And while they last, all things by them are bound;\nl
But the spirit's consent is needed for each act\nl
And Freedom walks in the same pace with Law.\nl
All here can change if the Magician choose.\nl
If human will could be made one with God's,\nl
If human thought could echo the thoughts of God,\nl
Man might be all-knowing and omnipotent;\nl
But now he walks in Nature's doubtful ray.\nl
Yet can the mind of man receive God's light,\nl
Page 457

The force of man can be driven by God's force,\nl
Then is he a miracle doing miracles.\nl
For only so can he be Nature's king.\nl
It is decreed and Satyavan must die;\nl
The hour is fixed, chosen the fatal stroke.\nl
What else shall be is written in her soul\nl
But till the hour reveals the fateful script,\nl
The writing waits illegible and mute.\nl
Fate is Truth working out in Ignorance.\nl
O King, thy fate is a transaction done\nl
At every hour between Nature and thy soul\nl
With God for its foreseeing arbiter.\nl
Fate is a balance drawn in Destiny's book.\nl
Man can accept his fate, he can refuse.\nl
Even if the One maintains the unseen decree\nl
He writes thy refusal in thy credit page:\nl
For doom is not a close, a mystic seal.\nl
Arisen from the tragic crash of life,\nl
Arisen from the body's torture and death,\nl
The spirit rises mightier by defeat;\nl
Its godlike wings grow wider with each fall.\nl
Its splendid failures sum to victory.\nl
O man, the events that meet thee on thy road,\nl
Though they smite thy body and soul with joy and grief,\nl
Are not thy fate,—they touch thee awhile and pass;\nl
Even death can cut not short thy spirit's walk:\nl
Thy goal, the road thou choosest are thy fate.\nl
On the altar throwing thy thoughts, thy heart, thy works,\nl
Thy fate is a long sacrifice to the gods\nl
Till they have opened to thee thy secret self\nl
And made thee one with the indwelling God.\nl
O soul, intruder in Nature's ignorance,\nl
Armed traveller to the unseen supernal heights,\nl
Thy spirit's fate is a battle and ceaseless march\nl
Against invisible opponent Powers,\nl
A passage from Matter into timeless self.\nl
Page 458

Adventurer through blind unforeseeing Time,\nl
A forced advance through a long line of lives,\nl
It pushes its spearhead through the centuries.\nl
Across the dust and mire of the earthly plain,\nl
On many guarded lines and dangerous fronts,\nl
In dire assaults, in wounded slow retreats,\nl
Holding the ideal's ringed and battered fort\nl
Or fighting against odds in lonely posts,\nl
Or camped in night around the bivouac's fires\nl
Awaiting the tardy trumpets of the dawn,\nl
In hunger and in plenty and in pain,\nl
Through peril and through triumph and through fall,\nl
Through life's green lanes and over her desert sands,\nl
Up the bald moor, along the sunlit ridge,\nl
In serried columns with a straggling rear\nl
Led by its nomad vanguard's signal fires,\nl
Marches the army of the waylost god.\nl
Then late the joy ineffable is felt,\nl
Then he remembers his forgotten self;\nl
He has refound the skies from which he fell.\nl
At length his front's indomitable line\nl
Forces the last passes of the Ignorance:\nl
Advancing beyond Nature's last known bounds,\nl
Reconnoitring the formidable unknown,\nl
Beyond the landmarks of things visible,\nl
It mounts through a miraculous upper air\nl
Till climbing the mute summit of the world\nl
He stands upon the splendour-peaks of God.\nl
In vain thou mournst that Satyavan must die;\nl
His death is a beginning of greater life,\nl
Death is the spirit's opportunity.\nl
A vast intention has brought two souls close\nl
And love and death conspire towards one great end.\nl
For out of danger and pain heaven-bliss shall come,\nl
Time's unforeseen event, God's secret plan.\nl
This world was not built with random bricks of Chance,\nl
Page 459

A blind god is not destiny's architect;\nl
A conscious power has drawn the plan of life,\nl
There is a meaning in each curve and line.\nl
It is an architecture high and grand\nl
By many named and nameless masons built\nl
In which unseeing hands obey the Unseen,\nl
And of its master-builders she is one.\nl
\sparn “Queen, strive no more to change the secret will;\nl
Time's accidents are steps in its vast scheme.\nl
Bring not thy brief and helpless human tears\nl
Across the fathomless moments of a heart\nl
That knows its single will and God's as one:\nl
It can embrace its hostile destiny;\nl
It sits apart with grief and facing death,\nl
Affronting adverse fate armed and alone.\nl
In this enormous world standing apart\nl
In the mightiness of her silent spirit's will,\nl
In the passion of her soul of sacrifice\nl
Her lonely strength facing the universe,\nl
Affronting fate, asks not man's help nor god's:\nl
Sometimes one life is charged with earth's destiny,\nl
It cries not for succour from the time-bound powers.\nl
Alone she is equal to her mighty task.\nl
Intervene not in a strife too great for thee,\nl
A struggle too deep for mortal thought to sound,\nl
Its question to this Nature's rigid bounds\nl
When the soul fronts nude of garbs the infinite,\nl
Its too vast theme of a lonely mortal will\nl
Pacing the silence of eternity.\nl
As a star, uncompanioned, moves in heaven\nl
Unastonished by the immensities of Space,\nl
Travelling infinity by its own light,\nl
The great are strongest when they stand alone.\nl
A God-given might of being is their force,\nl
A ray from self's solitude of light the guide;\nl
The soul that can live alone with itself meets God;\nl
Page 460

Its lonely universe is their rendezvous.\nl
A day may come when she must stand unhelped\nl
On a dangerous brink of the world's doom and hers,\nl
Carrying the world's future on her lonely breast,\nl
Carrying the human hope in a heart left sole\nl
To conquer or fail on a last desperate verge,\nl
Alone with death and close to extinction's edge.\nl
Her single greatness in that last dire scene\nl
Must cross alone a perilous bridge in Time\nl
And reach an apex of world-destiny\nl
Where all is won or all is lost for man.\nl
In that tremendous silence lone and lost\nl
Of a deciding hour in the world's fate,\nl
In her soul's climbing beyond mortal time\nl
When she stands sole with Death or sole with God\nl
Apart upon a silent desperate brink,\nl
Alone with her self and death and destiny\nl
As on some verge between Time and Timelessness\nl
When being must end or life rebuild its base,\nl
Alone she must conquer or alone must fall.\nl
No human aid can reach her in that hour,\nl
No armoured god stand shining at her side.\nl
Cry not to heaven, for she alone can save.\nl
For this the silent Force came missioned down;\nl
In her the conscious Will took human shape:\nl
She only can save herself and save the world.\nl
O queen, stand back from that stupendous scene,\nl
Come not between her and her hour of Fate.\nl
Her hour must come and none can intervene:\nl
Think not to turn her from her heaven-sent task,\nl
Strive not to save her from her own high will.\nl
Thou hast no place in that tremendous strife;\nl
Thy love and longing are not arbiters there;\nl
Leave the world's fate and her to God's sole guard.\nl
Even if he seems to leave her to her lone strength,\nl
Even though all falters and falls and sees an end\nl
Page 461

And the heart fails and only are death and night,\nl
God-given her strength can battle against doom\nl
Even on a brink where Death alone seems close\nl
And no human strength can hinder or can help.\nl
Think not to intercede with the hidden Will,\nl
Intrude not twixt her spirit and its force\nl
But leave her to her mighty self and Fate.”\nl

\spar He spoke and ceased and left the earthly scene.\nl
Away from the strife and suffering on our globe,\nl
He turned towards his far-off blissful home.\nl
A brilliant arrow pointing straight to heaven,\nl
The luminous body of the ethereal seer\nl
Assailed the purple glory of the noon\nl
And disappeared like a receding star\nl
Vanishing into the light of the Unseen.\nl
But still a cry was heard in the infinite,\nl
And still to the listening soul on mortal earth\nl
A high and far imperishable voice\nl
Chanted the anthem of eternal love.\nl

\sbigcap Fate followed her foreseen immutable road.\nl
Man's hopes and longings build the journeying wheels\nl
That bear the body of his destiny\nl
And lead his blind will towards an unknown goal.\nl
His fate within him shapes his acts and rules;\nl
Its face and form already are born in him,\nl
Its parentage is in his secret soul:\nl
Here Matter seems to mould the body's life\nl
And the soul follows where its nature drives.\nl
Nature and Fate compel his free-will's choice.\nl
But greater spirits this balance can reverse\nl
And make the soul the artist of its fate.\nl
This is the mystic truth our ignorance hides:\nl
Doom is a passage for our inborn force,\nl
Our ordeal is the hidden spirit's choice,\nl
Ananke is our being's own decree.\nl
All was fulfilled the heart of Savitri\nl
Flower-sweet and adamant, passionate and calm,\nl
Had chosen and on her strength's unbending road\nl
Forced to its issue the long cosmic curve.\nl
Once more she sat behind loud hastening hooves;\nl
A speed of armoured squadrons and a voice\nl
Far-heard of chariots bore her from her home.\nl
A couchant earth wakened in its dumb muse\nl
Looked up at her from a vast indolence:\nl
Hills wallowing in a bright haze, large lands\nl
That lolled at ease beneath the summer heavens,\nl
Region on region spacious in the sun,\nl
Cities like chrysolites in the wide blaze\nl
And yellow rivers pacing lion-maned\nl
Page 465

Led to the Shalwa marches' emerald line,\nl
A happy front to iron vastnesses\nl
And austere peaks and titan solitudes.\nl
Once more was near the fair and fated place,\nl
The borders gleaming with the groves' delight\nl
Where first she met the face of Satyavan\nl
And he saw like one waking into a dream\nl
Some timeless beauty and reality,\nl
The moon-gold sweetness of heaven's earth-born child.\nl
The past receded and the future neared:\nl
Far now behind lay Madra's spacious halls,\nl
The white carved pillars, the cool dim alcoves,\nl
The tinged mosaic of the crystal floors,\nl
The towered pavilions, the wind-rippled pools\nl
And gardens humming with the murmur of bees,\nl
Forgotten soon or a pale memory\nl
The fountain's plash in the white stone-bound pool,\nl
The thoughtful noontide's brooding solemn trance,\nl
The colonnade's dream grey in the quiet eve,\nl
The slow moonrise gliding in front of Night.\nl
Left far behind were now the faces known,\nl
The happy silken babble on laughter's lips\nl
And the close-clinging clasp of intimate hands\nl
And adoration's light in cherished eyes\nl
Offered to the one sovereign of their life.\nl
Nature's primaeval loneliness was here:\nl
Here only was the voice of bird and beast,—\nl
The ascetic's exile in the dim-souled huge\nl
Inhuman forest far from cheerful sound\nl
Of man's blithe converse and his crowded days.\nl
In a broad eve with one red eye of cloud,\nl
Through a narrow opening, a green flowered cleft,\nl
Out of the stare of sky and soil they came\nl
Into a mighty home of emerald dusk.\nl
There onward led by a faint brooding path\nl
Which toiled through the shadow of enormous trunks\nl
Page 466

And under arches misers of sunshine,\nl
They saw low thatched roofs of a hermitage\nl
Huddled beneath a patch of azure hue\nl
In a sunlit clearing that seemed the outbreak\nl
Of a glad smile in the forest's monstrous heart,\nl
A rude refuge of the thought and will of man\nl
Watched by the crowding giants of the wood.\nl
Arrived in that rough-hewn homestead they gave,\nl
Questioning no more the strangeness of her fate,\nl
Their pride and loved one to the great blind king,\nl
A regal pillar of fallen mightiness\nl
And the stately care-worn woman once a queen\nl
Who now hoped nothing for herself from life,\nl
But all things only hoped for her one child,\nl
Calling on that single head from partial Fate\nl
All joy of earth, all heaven's beatitude.\nl
Adoring wisdom and beauty like a young god's,\nl
She saw him loved by heaven as by herself,\nl
She rejoiced in his brightness and believed in his fate\nl
And knew not of the evil drawing near.\nl
Lingering some days upon the forest verge\nl
Like men who lengthen out departure's pain,\nl
Unwilling to separate sorrowful clinging hands,\nl
Unwilling to see for the last time a face,\nl
Heavy with the sorrow of a coming day\nl
And wondering at the carelessness of Fate\nl
Who breaks with idle hands her supreme works,\nl
They parted from her with pain-fraught burdened hearts\nl
As forced by inescapable fate we part\nl
From one whom we shall never see again;\nl
Driven by the singularity of her fate,\nl
Helpless against the choice of Savitri's heart\nl
They left her to her rapture and her doom\nl
In the tremendous forest's savage charge.\nl
All put behind her that was once her life,\nl
All welcomed that henceforth was his and hers,\nl
Page 467

She abode with Satyavan in the wild woods:\nl
Priceless she deemed her joy so close to death;\nl
Apart with love she lived for love alone.\nl
As if self-poised above the march of days,\nl
Her immobile spirit watched the haste of Time,\nl
A statue of passion and invincible force,\nl
An absolutism of sweet imperious will,\nl
A tranquillity and a violence of the gods\nl
Indomitable and immutable.\nl

\spar At first to her beneath the sapphire heavens\nl
The sylvan solitude was a gorgeous dream,\nl
An altar of the summer's splendour and fire,\nl
A sky-topped flower-hung palace of the gods\nl
And all its scenes a smile on rapture's lips\nl
And all its voices bards of happiness.\nl
There was a chanting in the casual wind,\nl
There was a glory in the least sunbeam;\nl
Night was a chrysoprase on velvet cloth,\nl
A nestling darkness or a moonlit deep;\nl
Day was a purple pageant and a hymn,\nl
A wave of the laughter of light from morn to eve.\nl
His absence was a dream of memory,\nl
His presence was the empire of a god.\nl
A fusing of the joys of earth and heaven,\nl
A tremulous blaze of nuptial rapture passed,\nl
A rushing of two spirits to be one,\nl
A burning of two bodies in one flame.\nl
Opened were gates of unforgettable bliss:\nl
Two lives were locked within an earthly heaven\nl
And fate and grief fled from that fiery hour.\nl
But soon now failed the summer's ardent breath\nl
And throngs of blue-black clouds crept through the sky\nl
And rain fled sobbing over the dripping leaves\nl
And storm became the forest's titan voice.\nl
Then listening to the thunder's fatal crash\nl
Page 468

And the fugitive pattering footsteps of the showers\nl
And the long unsatisfied panting of the wind\nl
And sorrow muttering in the sound-vexed night,\nl
The grief of all the world came near to her.\nl
Night's darkness seemed her future's ominous face.\nl
The shadow of her lover's doom arose\nl
And fear laid hands upon her mortal heart.\nl
The moments swift and ruthless raced; alarmed\nl
Her thoughts, her mind remembered Narad's date.\nl
A trembling moved accountant of her riches,\nl
She reckoned the insufficient days between:\nl
A dire expectancy knocked at her breast;\nl
Dreadful to her were the footsteps of the hours:\nl
Grief came, a passionate stranger to her gate:\nl
Banished when in his arms, out of her sleep\nl
It rose at morn to look into her face.\nl
Vainly she fled into abysms of bliss\nl
From her pursuing foresight of the end.\nl
The more she plunged into love that anguish grew;\nl
Her deepest grief from sweetest gulfs arose.\nl
Remembrance was a poignant pang, she felt\nl
Each day a golden leaf torn cruelly out\nl
From her too slender book of love and joy.\nl
Thus swaying in strong gusts of happiness\nl
And swimming in foreboding's sombre waves\nl
And feeding sorrow and terror with her heart,—\nl
For now they sat among her bosom's guests\nl
Or in her inner chamber paced apart,—\nl
Her eyes stared blind into the future's night.\nl
Out of her separate self she looked and saw,\nl
Moving amid the unconscious faces loved,\nl
In mind a stranger though in heart so near,\nl
The ignorant smiling world go happily by\nl
Upon its way towards an unknown doom\nl
And wondered at the careless lives of men.\nl
As if in different worlds they walked, though close,\nl
Page 469

They confident of the returning sun,\nl
They wrapped in little hourly hopes and tasks,—\nl
She in her dreadful knowledge was alone.\nl
The rich and happy secrecy that once\nl
Enshrined her as if in a silver bower\nl
Apart in a bright nest of thoughts and dreams\nl
Made room for tragic hours of solitude\nl
And lonely grief that none could share or know,\nl
A body seeing the end too soon of joy\nl
And the fragile happiness of its mortal love.\nl
Her quiet visage still and sweet and calm,\nl
Her graceful daily acts were now a mask;\nl
In vain she looked upon her depths to find\nl
A ground of stillness and the spirit's peace.\nl
Still veiled from her was the silent Being within\nl
Who sees life's drama pass with unmoved eyes,\nl
Supports the sorrow of the mind and heart\nl
And bears in human breasts the world and fate.\nl
A glimpse or flashes came, the Presence was hid.\nl
Only her violent heart and passionate will\nl
Were pushed in front to meet the immutable doom;\nl
Defenceless, nude, bound to her human lot\nl
They had no means to act, no way to save.\nl
These she controlled, nothing was shown outside:\nl
She was still to them the child they knew and loved;\nl
The sorrowing woman they saw not within.\nl
No change was in her beautiful motions seen:\nl
A worshipped empress all once vied to serve,\nl
She made herself the diligent serf of all,\nl
Nor spared the labour of broom and jar and well,\nl
Or close gentle tending or to heap the fire\nl
Of altar and kitchen, no slight task allowed\nl
To others that her woman's strength might do.\nl
In all her acts a strange divinity shone:\nl
Into a simplest movement she could bring\nl
A oneness with earth's glowing robe of light,\nl
A lifting up of common acts by love.\nl
Page 470

All-love was hers and its one heavenly cord\nl
Bound all to all with her as golden tie.\nl
But when her grief to the surface pressed too close,\nl
These things, once gracious adjuncts of her joy,\nl
Seemed meaningless to her, a gleaming shell,\nl
Or were a round mechanical and void,\nl
Her body's actions shared not by her will.\nl
Always behind this strange divided life\nl
Her spirit like a sea of living fire\nl
Possessed her lover and to his body clung,\nl
One locked embrace to guard its threatened mate.\nl
At night she woke through the slow silent hours\nl
Brooding on the treasure of his bosom and face,\nl
Hung o'er the sleep-bound beauty of his brow\nl
Or laid her burning cheek upon his feet.\nl
Waking at morn her lips endlessly clung to his,\nl
Unwilling ever to separate again\nl
Or lose that honeyed drain of lingering joy,\nl
Unwilling to loose his body from her breast,\nl
The warm inadequate signs that love must use.\nl
Intolerant of the poverty of Time\nl
Her passion catching at the fugitive hours\nl
Willed the expense of centuries in one day\nl
Of prodigal love and the surf of ecstasy;\nl
Or else she strove even in mortal time\nl
To build a little room for timelessness\nl
By the deep union of two human lives,\nl
Her soul secluded shut into his soul.\nl
After all was given she demanded still;\nl
Even by his strong embrace unsatisfied,\nl
She longed to cry, “O tender Satyavan,\nl
O lover of my soul, give more, give more\nl
Of love while yet thou canst, to her thou lov'st.\nl
Imprint thyself for every nerve to keep\nl
That thrills to thee the message of my heart.\nl
For soon we part and who shall know how long\nl
Before the great wheel in its monstrous round\nl
Page 471

Restore us to each other and our love?”\nl
Too well she loved to speak a fateful word\nl
And lay her burden on his happy head;\nl
She pressed the outsurging grief back into her breast\nl
To dwell within silent, unhelped, alone.\nl
But Satyavan sometimes half understood,\nl
Or felt at least with the uncertain answer\nl
Of our thought-blinded hearts the unuttered need,\nl
The unplumbed abyss of her deep passionate want.\nl
All of his speeding days that he could spare\nl
From labour in the forest hewing wood\nl
And hunting food in the wild sylvan glades\nl
And service to his father's sightless life\nl
He gave to her and helped to increase the hours\nl
By the nearness of his presence and his clasp,\nl
And lavish softness of heart-seeking words\nl
And the close beating felt of heart on heart.\nl
All was too little for her bottomless need.\nl
If in his presence she forgot awhile,\nl
Grief filled his absence with its aching touch;\nl
She saw the desert of her coming days\nl
Imaged in every solitary hour.\nl
Although with a vain imaginary bliss\nl
Of fiery union through death's door of escape\nl
She dreamed of her body robed in funeral flame,\nl
She knew she must not clutch that happiness\nl
To die with him and follow, seizing his robe\nl
Across our other countries, travellers glad\nl
Into the sweet or terrible Beyond.\nl
For those sad parents still would need her here\nl
To help the empty remnant of their day.\nl
Often it seemed to her the ages' pain\nl
Had pressed their quintessence into her single woe,\nl
Concentrating in her a tortured world.\nl
Thus in the silent chamber of her soul\nl
Cloistering her love to live with secret grief\nl
She dwelt like a dumb priest with hidden gods\nl
Page 472

Unappeased by the wordless offering of her days,\nl
Lifting to them her sorrow like frankincense,\nl
Her life the altar, herself the sacrifice.\nl
Yet ever they grew into each other more\nl
Until it seemed no power could rend apart,\nl
Since even the body's walls could not divide.\nl
For when he wandered in the forest, oft\nl
Her conscious spirit walked with him and knew\nl
His actions as if in herself he moved;\nl
He, less aware, thrilled with her from afar.\nl
Always the stature of her passion grew;\nl
Grief, fear became the food of mighty love.\nl
Increased by its torment it filled the whole world;\nl
It was all her life, became her whole earth and heaven.\nl
Although life-born, an infant of the hours,\nl
Immortal it walked unslayable as the gods:\nl
Her spirit stretched measureless in strength divine,\nl
An anvil for the blows of Fate and Time:\nl
Or tired of sorrow's passionate luxury,\nl
Grief's self became calm, dull-eyed, resolute,\nl
Awaiting some issue of its fiery struggle,\nl
Some deed in which it might for ever cease,\nl
Victorious over itself and death and tears.\nl
\sparn The year now paused upon the brink of change.\nl
No more the storms sailed with stupendous wings\nl
And thunder strode in wrath across the world,\nl
But still was heard a muttering in the sky\nl
And rain dripped wearily through the mournful air\nl
And grey slow-drifting clouds shut in the earth.\nl
So her grief's heavy sky shut in her heart.\nl
A still self hid behind but gave no light:\nl
No voice came down from the forgotten heights;\nl
Only in the privacy of its brooding pain\nl
Her human heart spoke to the body's fate.\nl

\ht Canto Two: The Parable of the Search for the Soul
\par
\sbigcap As in the vigilance of the sleepless night\nl
Through the slow heavy-footed silent hours,\nl
Repressing in her bosom its load of grief,\nl
She sat staring at the dumb tread of Time\nl
And the approach of ever-nearing Fate,\nl
A summons from her being's summit came,\nl
A sound, a call that broke the seals of Night.\nl
Above her brows where will and knowledge meet\nl
A mighty Voice invaded mortal space.\nl
It seemed to come from inaccessible heights\nl
And yet was intimate with all the world\nl
And knew the meaning of the steps of Time\nl
And saw eternal destiny's changeless scene\nl
Filling the far prospect of the cosmic gaze.\nl
As the Voice touched, her body became a stark\nl
And rigid golden statue of motionless trance,\nl
A stone of God lit by an amethyst soul.\nl
Around her body's stillness all grew still:\nl
Her heart listened to its slow measured beats,\nl
Her mind renouncing thought heard and was mute:\nl
“Why camest thou to this dumb deathbound earth,\nl
This ignorant life beneath indifferent skies\nl
Tied like a sacrifice on the altar of Time,\nl
O spirit, O immortal energy,\nl
If 'twas to nurse grief in a helpless heart\nl
Or with hard tearless eyes await thy doom?\nl
Arise, O soul, and vanquish Time and Death.”\nl
But Savitri's heart replied in the dim night:\nl
“My strength is taken from me and given to Death.\nl
Why should I lift my hands to the shut heavens\nl
Or struggle with mute inevitable Fate\nl
Page 474

Or hope in vain to uplift an ignorant race\nl
Who hug their lot and mock the saviour Light\nl
And see in Mind wisdom's sole tabernacle,\nl
In its harsh peak and its inconscient base\nl
A rock of safety and an anchor of sleep?\nl
Is there a God whom any cry can move?\nl
He sits in peace and leaves the mortal's strength\nl
Impotent against his calm omnipotent Law\nl
And Inconscience and the almighty hands of Death.\nl
What need have I, what need has Satyavan\nl
To avoid the black-meshed net, the dismal door,\nl
Or call a mightier Light into life's closed room,\nl
A greater Law into man's little world?\nl
Why should I strive with earth's unyielding laws\nl
Or stave off death's inevitable hour?\nl
This surely is best to pactise with my fate\nl
And follow close behind my lover's steps\nl
And pass through night from twilight to the sun\nl
Across the tenebrous river that divides\nl
The adjoining parishes of earth and heaven.\nl
Then could we lie inarmed breast upon breast,\nl
Untroubled by thought, untroubled by our hearts,\nl
Forgetting man and life and time and its hours,\nl
Forgetting eternity's call, forgetting God.”\nl
The Voice replied: “Is this enough, O spirit?\nl
And what shall thy soul say when it wakes and knows\nl
The work was left undone for which it came?\nl
Or is this all for thy being born on earth\nl
Charged with a mandate from eternity,\nl
A listener to the voices of the years,\nl
A follower of the footprints of the gods,\nl
To pass and leave unchanged the old dusty laws?\nl
Shall there be no new tables, no new Word,\nl
No greater light come down upon the earth\nl
Delivering her from her unconsciousness,\nl
Man's spirit from unalterable Fate?\nl
Page 475

Cam'st thou not down to open the doors of Fate,\nl
The iron doors that seemed for ever closed,\nl
And lead man to Truth's wide and golden road\nl
That runs through finite things to eternity?\nl
Is this then the report that I must make,\nl
My head bowed with shame before the Eternal's seat,—\nl
His power he kindled in thy body has failed,\nl
His labourer returns, her task undone?”\nl
Then Savitri's heart fell mute, it spoke no word.\nl
But holding back her troubled rebel heart,\nl
Abrupt, erect and strong, calm like a hill,\nl
Surmounting the seas of mortal ignorance,\nl
Its peak immutable above mind's air,\nl
A Power within her answered the still Voice:\nl
“I am thy portion here charged with thy work,\nl
As thou myself seated for ever above,\nl
Speak to my depths, O great and deathless Voice,\nl
Command, for I am here to do thy will.”\nl
The Voice replied: “Remember why thou cam'st:\nl
Find out thy soul, recover thy hid self,\nl
In silence seek God's meaning in thy depths,\nl
Then mortal nature change to the divine.\nl
Open God's door, enter into his trance.\nl
Cast Thought from thee, that nimble ape of Light:\nl
In his tremendous hush stilling thy brain\nl
His vast Truth wake within and know and see.\nl
Cast from thee sense that veils thy spirit's sight:\nl
In the enormous emptiness of thy mind\nl
Thou shalt see the Eternal's body in the world,\nl
Know him in every voice heard by thy soul,\nl
In the world's contacts meet his single touch;\nl
All things shall fold thee into his embrace.\nl
Conquer thy heart's throbs, let thy heart beat in God:\nl
Thy nature shall be the engine of his works,\nl
Thy voice shall house the mightiness of his Word:\nl
Then shalt thou harbour my force and conquer Death.”\nl
Page 476

Then Savitri by her doomed husband sat,\nl
Still rigid in her golden motionless pose,\nl
A statue of the fire of the inner sun.\nl
In the black night the wrath of storm swept by,\nl
The thunder crashed above her, the rain hissed,\nl
Its million footsteps pattered on the roof.\nl
Impassive mid the movement and the cry,\nl
Witness of the thoughts of mind, the moods of life,\nl
She looked into herself and sought for her soul.\nl

\spar A dream disclosed to her the cosmic past,\nl
The crypt-seed and the mystic origins,\nl
The shadowy beginnings of world-fate:\nl
A lamp of symbol lighting hidden truth\nl
Imaged to her the world's significance.\nl
In the indeterminate formlessness of Self\nl
Creation took its first mysterious steps,\nl
It made the body's shape a house of soul\nl
And Matter learned to think and person grew;\nl
She saw Space peopled with the seeds of life\nl
And saw the human creature born in Time.\nl
At first appeared a dim half-neutral tide\nl
Of being emerging out of infinite Nought:\nl
A consciousness looked at the inconscient Vast\nl
And pleasure and pain stirred in the insensible Void.\nl
All was the deed of a blind World-Energy:\nl
Unconscious of her own exploits she worked,\nl
Shaping a universe out of the Inane.\nl
In fragmentary beings she grew aware:\nl
A chaos of little sensibilities\nl
Gathered round a small ego's pin-point head;\nl
In it a sentient creature found its poise,\nl
It moved and lived a breathing, thinking whole.\nl
On a dim ocean of subconscient life\nl
A formless surface consciousness awoke:\nl
A stream of thoughts and feelings came and went,\nl
Page 477

A foam of memories hardened and became\nl
A bright crust of habitual sense and thought,\nl
A seat of living personality\nl
And recurrent habits mimicked permanence.\nl
Mind nascent laboured out a mutable form,\nl
It built a mobile house on shifting sands,\nl
A floating isle upon a bottomless sea.\nl
A conscious being was by this labour made;\nl
It looked around it on its difficult field\nl
In the green wonderful and perilous earth;\nl
It hoped in a brief body to survive,\nl
Relying on Matter's false eternity.\nl
It felt a godhead in its fragile house;\nl
It saw blue heavens, dreamed immortality.\nl
\sparn A conscious soul in the Inconscient's world,\nl
Hidden behind our thoughts and hopes and dreams,\nl
An indifferent Master signing Nature's acts\nl
Leaves the vicegerent mind a seeming king.\nl
In his floating house upon the sea of Time\nl
The regent sits at work and never rests:\nl
He is a puppet of the dance of Time;\nl
He is driven by the hours, the moment's call\nl
Compels him with the thronging of life's need\nl
And the babel of the voices of the world.\nl
This mind no silence knows nor dreamless sleep,\nl
In the incessant circling of its steps\nl
Thoughts tread for ever through the listening brain;\nl
It toils like a machine and cannot stop.\nl
Into the body's many-storeyed rooms\nl
Endless crowd down the dream-god's messages.\nl
All is a hundred-toned murmur and babble and stir,\nl
There is a tireless running to and fro,\nl
A haste of movement and a ceaseless cry.\nl
The hurried servant senses answer apace\nl
To every knock upon the outer doors,\nl
Bring in time's visitors, report each call,\nl
Page 478

Admit the thousand queries and the calls\nl
And the messages of communicating minds\nl
And the heavy business of unnumbered lives\nl
And all the thousandfold commerce of the world.\nl
Even in the tracts of sleep is scant repose;\nl
He mocks life's steps in strange subconscient dreams,\nl
He strays in a subtle realm of symbol scenes,\nl
His night with thin-air visions and dim forms\nl
He packs or peoples with slight drifting shapes\nl
And only a moment spends in silent Self.\nl
Adventuring into infinite mind-space\nl
He unfolds his wings of thought in inner air,\nl
Or travelling in imagination's car\nl
Crosses the globe, journeys beneath the stars,\nl
To subtle worlds takes his ethereal course,\nl
Visits the Gods on Life's miraculous peaks,\nl
Communicates with Heaven, tampers with Hell.\nl
This is the little surface of man's life.\nl
He is this and he is all the universe;\nl
He scales the Unseen, his depths dare the Abyss;\nl
A whole mysterious world is locked within.\nl
Unknown to himself he lives a hidden king\nl
Behind rich tapestries in great secret rooms;\nl
An epicure of the spirit's unseen joys,\nl
He lives on the sweet honey of solitude:\nl
A nameless god in an unapproachable fane,\nl
In the secret adytum of his inmost soul\nl
He guards the being's covered mysteries\nl
Beneath the threshold, behind shadowy gates\nl
Or shut in vast cellars of inconscient sleep.\nl
The immaculate Divine All-Wonderful\nl
Casts into the argent purity of his soul\nl
His splendour and his greatness and the light\nl
Of self-creation in Time's infinity\nl
As into a sublimely mirroring glass.\nl
Man in the world's life works out the dreams of God.\nl
Page 479

But all is there, even God's opposites;\nl
He is a little front of Nature's works,\nl
A thinking outline of a cryptic Force.\nl
All she reveals in him that is in her,\nl
Her glories walk in him and her darknesses.\nl
Man's house of life holds not the gods alone:\nl
There are occult Shadows, there are tenebrous Powers,\nl
Inhabitants of life's ominous nether rooms,\nl
A shadowy world's stupendous denizens.\nl
A careless guardian of his nature's powers,\nl
Man harbours dangerous forces in his house.\nl
The Titan and the Fury and the Djinn\nl
Lie bound in the subconscient's cavern pit\nl
And the Beast grovels in his antre den:\nl
Dire mutterings rise and murmur in their drowse.\nl
Insurgent sometimes raises its huge head\nl
A monstrous mystery lurking in life's deeps,\nl
The mystery of dark and fallen worlds,\nl
The dread visages of the adversary Kings.\nl
The dreadful powers held down within his depths\nl
Become his masters or his ministers;\nl
Enormous they invade his bodily house,\nl
Can act in his acts, infest his thought and life.\nl
Inferno surges into the human air\nl
And touches all with a perverting breath.\nl
Grey forces like a thin miasma creep,\nl
Stealing through chinks in his closed mansion's doors,\nl
Discolouring the walls of upper mind\nl
In which he lives his fair and specious life,\nl
And leave behind a stench of sin and death:\nl
Not only rise in him perverse drifts of thought\nl
And formidable formless influences,\nl
But there come presences and awful shapes:\nl
Tremendous forms and faces mount dim steps\nl
And stare at times into his living-rooms,\nl
Or called up for a moment's passionate work\nl
Page 480

Lay a dire custom's claim upon his heart:\nl
Aroused from sleep, they can be bound no more.\nl
Afflicting the daylight and alarming night,\nl
Invading at will his outer tenement,\nl
The stark gloom's grisly dire inhabitants\nl
Mounting into God's light all light perturb.\nl
All they have touched or seen they make their own,\nl
In Nature's basement lodge, mind's passages fill,\nl
Disrupt thought's links and musing sequences,\nl
Break through the soul's stillness with a noise and cry\nl
Or they call the inhabitants of the abyss,\nl
Invite the instincts to forbidden joys,\nl
A laughter wake of dread demoniac mirth\nl
And with nether riot and revel shake life's floor.\nl
Impotent to quell his terrible prisoners,\nl
Appalled the householder helpless sits above,\nl
Taken from him his house is his no more.\nl
He is bound and forced, a victim of the play,\nl
Or, allured, joys in the mad and mighty din.\nl
His nature's dangerous forces have arisen\nl
And hold at will a rebel's holiday.\nl
Aroused from the darkness where they crouched in the depths,\nl
Prisoned from the sight, they can be held no more;\nl
His nature's impulses are now his lords.\nl
Once quelled or wearing specious names and vests\nl
Infernal elements, demon powers are there.\nl
Man's lower nature hides these awful guests.\nl
Their vast contagion grips sometimes man's world.\nl
An awful insurgence overpowers man's soul.\nl
In house and house the huge uprising grows:\nl
Hell's companies are loosed to do their work,\nl
Into the earth-ways they break out from all doors,\nl
Invade with blood-lust and the will to slay\nl
And fill with horror and carnage God's fair world.\nl
Death and his hunters stalk a victim earth;\nl
The terrible Angel smites at every door:\nl
Page 481

An awful laughter mocks at the world's pain\nl
And massacre and torture grin at Heaven:\nl
All is the prey of the destroying force;\nl
Creation rocks and tremble top and base.\nl
This evil Nature housed in human hearts,\nl
A foreign inhabitant, a dangerous guest:\nl
The soul that harbours it it can dislodge,\nl
Expel the householder, possess the house.\nl
An opposite potency contradicting God,\nl
A momentary Evil's almightiness\nl
Has straddled the straight path of Nature's acts.\nl
It imitates the Godhead it denies,\nl
Puts on his figure and assumes his face.\nl
A Manichean creator and destroyer,\nl
This can abolish man, annul his world.\nl
But there is a guardian power, there are Hands that save,\nl
Calm eyes divine regard the human scene.\nl

\spar All the world's possibilities in man\nl
Are waiting as the tree waits in its seed:\nl
His past lives in him; it drives his future's pace;\nl
His present's acts fashion his coming fate.\nl
The unborn gods hide in his house of Life.\nl
The daemons of the unknown overshadow his mind\nl
Casting their dreams into live moulds of thought,\nl
The moulds in which his mind builds out its world.\nl
His mind creates around him its universe.\nl
All that has been renews in him its birth;\nl
All that can be is figured in his soul.\nl
Issuing in deeds it scores on the roads of the world,\nl
Obscure to the interpreting reason's guess,\nl
Lines of the secret purpose of the gods.\nl
In strange directions runs the intricate plan;\nl
Held back from human foresight is their end\nl
And the far intention of some ordering Will\nl
Or the order of life's arbitrary Chance\nl
Page 482

Finds out its settled poise and fated hour.\nl
Our surface watched in vain by reason's gaze,\nl
Invaded by the impromptus of the unseen,\nl
Helpless records the accidents of Time,\nl
The involuntary turns and leaps of life.\nl
Only a little of us foresees its steps,\nl
Only a little has will and purposed pace.\nl
A vast subliminal is man's measureless part.\nl
The dim subconscient is his cavern base.\nl
Abolished vainly in the walks of Time\nl
Our past lives still in our unconscious selves\nl
And by the weight of its hidden influences\nl
Is shaped our future's self-discovery.\nl
Thus all is an inevitable chain\nl
And yet a series seems of accidents.\nl
The unremembering hours repeat the old acts,\nl
Our dead past round our future's ankles clings\nl
And drags back the new nature's glorious stride,\nl
Or from its buried corpse old ghosts arise,\nl
Old thoughts, old longings, dead passions live again,\nl
Recur in sleep or move the waking man\nl
To words that force the barrier of the lips,\nl
To deeds that suddenly start and o'erleap\nl
His head of reason and his guardian will.\nl
An old self lurks in the new self we are;\nl
Hardly we escape from what we once had been:\nl
In the dim gleam of habit's passages,\nl
In the subconscient's darkling corridors\nl
All things are carried by the porter nerves\nl
And nothing checked by subterranean mind,\nl
Unstudied by the guardians of the doors\nl
And passed by a blind instinctive memory,\nl
The old gang dismissed, old cancelled passports serve.\nl
Nothing is wholly dead that once had lived;\nl
In dim tunnels of the world's being and in ours\nl
The old rejected nature still survives;\nl
Page 483

The corpses of its slain thoughts raise their heads\nl
And visit mind's nocturnal walks in sleep,\nl
Its stifled impulses breathe and move and rise;\nl
All keeps a phantom immortality.\nl
Irresistible are Nature's sequences:\nl
The seeds of sins renounced sprout from hid soil;\nl
The evil cast from our hearts once more we face;\nl
Our dead selves come to slay our living soul.\nl
A portion of us lives in present Time,\nl
A secret mass in dim inconscience gropes;\nl
Out of the inconscient and subliminal\nl
Arisen, we live in mind's uncertain light\nl
And strive to know and master a dubious world\nl
Whose purpose and meaning are hidden from our sight.\nl
Above us dwells a superconscient God\nl
Hidden in the mystery of his own light:\nl
Around us is a vast of ignorance\nl
Lit by the uncertain ray of human mind,\nl
Below us sleeps the Inconscient dark and mute.\nl
\sparn But this is only Matter's first self-view,\nl
A scale and series in the Ignorance.\nl
This is not all we are or all our world.\nl
Our greater self of knowledge waits for us,\nl
A supreme light in the truth-conscious Vast:\nl
It sees from summits beyond thinking mind,\nl
It moves in a splendid air transcending life.\nl
It shall descend and make earth's life divine.\nl
Truth made the world, not a blind Nature-Force.\nl
For here are not our large diviner heights;\nl
Our summits in the superconscient's blaze\nl
Are glorious with the very face of God:\nl
There is our aspect of eternity,\nl
There is the figure of the god we are,\nl
His young unaging look on deathless things,\nl
His joy in our escape from death and Time,\nl
His immortality and light and bliss.\nl
Page 484

Our larger being sits behind cryptic walls:\nl
There are greatnesses hidden in our unseen parts\nl
That wait their hour to step into life's front:\nl
We feel an aid from deep indwelling Gods;\nl
One speaks within, Light comes to us from above.\nl
Our soul from its mysterious chamber acts;\nl
Its influence pressing on our heart and mind\nl
Pushes them to exceed their mortal selves.\nl
It seeks for Good and Beauty and for God;\nl
We see beyond self's walls our limitless self,\nl
We gaze through our world's glass at half-seen vasts,\nl
We hunt for the Truth behind apparent things.\nl
Our inner Mind dwells in a larger light,\nl
Its brightness looks at us through hidden doors;\nl
Our members luminous grow and Wisdom's face\nl
Appears in the doorway of the mystic ward:\nl
When she enters into our house of outward sense,\nl
Then we look up and see, above, her sun.\nl
A mighty life-self with its inner powers\nl
Supports the dwarfish modicum we call life;\nl
It can graft upon our crawl two puissant wings.\nl
Our body's subtle self is throned within\nl
In its viewless palace of veridical dreams\nl
That are bright shadows of the thoughts of God.\nl
In the prone obscure beginnings of the race\nl
The human grew in the bowed apelike man.\nl
He stood erect, a godlike form and force,\nl
And a soul's thoughts looked out from earth-born eyes;\nl
Man stood erect, he wore the thinker's brow:\nl
He looked at heaven and saw his comrade stars;\nl
A vision came of beauty and greater birth\nl
Slowly emerging from the heart's chapel of light\nl
And moved in a white lucent air of dreams.\nl
He saw his being's unrealised vastnesses,\nl
He aspired and housed the nascent demigod.\nl
Out of the dim recesses of the self\nl
Page 485

The occult seeker into the open came:\nl
He heard the far and touched the intangible,\nl
He gazed into the future and the unseen;\nl
He used the powers earth-instruments cannot use,\nl
A pastime made of the impossible;\nl
He caught up fragments of the Omniscient's thought,\nl
He scattered formulas of omnipotence.\nl
Thus man in his little house made of earth's dust\nl
Grew towards an unseen heaven of thought and dream\nl
Looking into the vast vistas of his mind\nl
On a small globe dotting infinity.\nl
At last climbing a long and narrow stair\nl
He stood alone on the high roof of things\nl
And saw the light of a spiritual sun.\nl
Aspiring he transcends his earthly self;\nl
He stands in the largeness of his soul new-born,\nl
Redeemed from encirclement by mortal things\nl
And moves in a pure free spiritual realm\nl
As in the rare breath of a stratosphere;\nl
A last end of far lines of divinity,\nl
He mounts by a frail thread to his high source;\nl
He reaches his fount of immortality,\nl
He calls the Godhead into his mortal life.\nl
All this the spirit concealed had done in her:\nl
A portion of the mighty Mother came\nl
Into her as into its own human part:\nl
Amid the cosmic workings of the Gods\nl
It marked her the centre of a wide-drawn scheme,\nl
Dreamed in the passion of her far-seeing spirit\nl
To mould humanity into God's own shape\nl
And lead this great blind struggling world to light\nl
Or a new world discover or create.\nl
Earth must transform herself and equal Heaven\nl
Or Heaven descend into earth's mortal state.\nl
But for such vast spiritual change to be,\nl
Out of the mystic cavern in man's heart\nl
Page 486

The heavenly Psyche must put off her veil\nl
And step into common nature's crowded rooms\nl
And stand uncovered in that nature's front\nl
And rule its thoughts and fill the body and life.\nl
Obedient to a high command she sat:\nl
Time, life and death were passing incidents\nl
Obstructing with their transient view her sight,\nl
Her sight that must break through and liberate the god\nl
Imprisoned in the visionless mortal man.\nl
The inferior nature born into ignorance\nl
Still took too large a place, it veiled her self\nl
And must be pushed aside to find her soul.\nl

\ht Canto Three: The Entry into the Inner Countries
\par
\sbigcap At first out of the busy hum of mind\nl
As if from a loud thronged market into a cave\nl
By an inward moment's magic she had come.\nl
A stark hushed emptiness became her self:\nl
Her mind unvisited by the voice of thought\nl
Stared at a void deep's dumb infinity.\nl
Her heights receded, her depths behind her closed;\nl
All fled away from her and left her blank.\nl
But when she came back to her self of thought,\nl
Once more she was a human thing on earth,\nl
A lump of Matter, a house of closed sight,\nl
A mind compelled to think out ignorance,\nl
A life-force pressed into a camp of works\nl
And the material world her limiting field.\nl
Amazed like one unknowing she sought her way\nl
Out of the tangle of man's ignorant past\nl
That took the surface person for the soul.\nl
Then a Voice spoke that dwelt on secret heights:\nl
“For man thou seekst, not for thyself alone.\nl
Only if God assumes the human mind\nl
And puts on mortal ignorance for his cloak\nl
And makes himself the Dwarf with triple stride,\nl
Can he help man to grow into the God.\nl
As man disguised the cosmic Greatness works\nl
And finds the mystic inaccessible gate\nl
And opens the Immortal's golden door.\nl
Man, human, follows in God's human steps.\nl
Accepting his darkness thou must bring to him light,\nl
Accepting his sorrow thou must bring to him bliss.\nl
In Matter's body find thy heaven-born soul.”\nl
Then Savitri surged out of her body's wall\nl
Page 488

And stood a little span outside herself\nl
And looked into her subtle being's depths\nl
And in its heart as in a lotus-bud\nl
Divined her secret and mysterious soul.\nl
At the dim portal of the inner life\nl
That bars out from our depths the body's mind\nl
And all that lives but by the body's breath,\nl
She knocked and pressed against the ebony gate.\nl
The living portal groaned with sullen hinge:\nl
Heavily reluctant it complained inert\nl
Against the tyranny of the spirit's touch.\nl
A formidable voice cried from within:\nl
“Back, creature of earth, lest tortured and torn thou die.”\nl
A dreadful murmur rose like a dim sea;\nl
The Serpent of the threshold hissing rose,\nl
A fatal guardian hood with monstrous coils,\nl
The hounds of darkness growled with jaws agape,\nl
And trolls and gnomes and goblins scowled and stared\nl
And wild beast roarings thrilled the blood with fear\nl
And menace muttered in a dangerous tongue.\nl
Unshaken her will pressed on the rigid bars:\nl
The gate swung wide with a protesting jar,\nl
The opponent Powers withdrew their dreadful guard;\nl
Her being entered into the inner worlds.\nl
In a narrow passage, the subconscient's gate,\nl
She breathed with difficulty and pain and strove\nl
To find the inner self concealed in sense.\nl
Into a dense of subtle Matter packed,\nl
A cavity filled with a blind mass of power,\nl
An opposition of misleading gleams,\nl
A heavy barrier of unseeing sight,\nl
She forced her way through body to the soul.\nl
Across a perilous border line she passed\nl
Where Life dips into the subconscient dusk\nl
Or struggles from Matter into chaos of mind,\nl
Aswarm with elemental entities\nl
Page 489

And fluttering shapes of vague half-bodied thought\nl
And crude beginnings of incontinent force.\nl
At first a difficult narrowness was there,\nl
A press of uncertain powers and drifting wills;\nl
For all was there but nothing in its place.\nl
At times an opening came, a door was forced;\nl
She crossed through spaces of a secret self\nl
And trod in passages of inner Time.\nl
At last she broke into a form of things,\nl
A start of finiteness, a world of sense:\nl
But all was still confused, nothing self-found.\nl
Soul was not there but only cries of life.\nl
A thronged and clamorous air environed her.\nl
A horde of sounds defied significance,\nl
A dissonant clash of cries and contrary calls;\nl
A mob of visions broke across the sight,\nl
A jostled sequence lacking sense and suite,\nl
Feelings pushed through a packed and burdened heart,\nl
Each forced its separate inconsequent way\nl
But cared for nothing but its ego's drive.\nl
A rally without key of common will,\nl
Thought stared at thought and pulled at the taut brain\nl
As if to pluck the reason from its seat\nl
And cast its corpse into life's wayside drain;\nl
So might forgotten lie in Nature's mud\nl
Abandoned the slain sentinel of the soul.\nl
So could life's power shake from it mind's rule,\nl
Nature renounce the spirit's government\nl
And the bare elemental energies\nl
Make of the sense a glory of boundless joy,\nl
A splendour of ecstatic anarchy,\nl
A revel mighty and mad of utter bliss.\nl
This was the sense's instinct void of soul\nl
Or when the soul sleeps hidden void of power,\nl
But now the vital godhead wakes within\nl
And lifts the life with the Supernal's touch.\nl
Page 490

But how shall come the glory and the flame\nl
If mind is cast away into the abyss?\nl
For body without mind has not the light,\nl
The rapture of spirit sense, the joy of life;\nl
All then becomes subconscient, tenebrous,\nl
Inconscience puts its seal on Nature's page\nl
Or else a mad disorder whirls the brain\nl
Posting along a ravaged nature's roads,\nl
A chaos of disordered impulses\nl
In which no light can come, no joy, no peace.\nl
This state now threatened, this she pushed from her.\nl
As if in a long endless tossing street\nl
One driven mid a trampling hurrying crowd\nl
Hour after hour she trod without release\nl
Holding by her will the senseless meute at bay;\nl
Out of the dreadful press she dragged her will\nl
And fixed her thought upon the saviour Name;\nl
Then all grew still and empty; she was free.\nl
A large deliverance came, a vast calm space.\nl
Awhile she moved through a blank tranquillity\nl
Of naked Light from an invisible sun,\nl
A void that was a bodiless happiness,\nl
A blissful vacuum of nameless peace.\nl
But now a mightier danger's front drew near:\nl
The press of bodily mind, the Inconscient's brood\nl
Of aimless thought and will had fallen from her.\nl
Approaching loomed a giant head of Life\nl
Ungoverned by mind or soul, subconscient, vast.\nl
It tossed all power into a single drive,\nl
It made its power a might of dangerous seas.\nl
Into the stillness of her silent self,\nl
Into the whiteness of its muse of Space\nl
A spate, a torrent of the speed of Life\nl
Broke like a wind-lashed driven mob of waves\nl
Racing on a pale floor of summer sand;\nl
It drowned its banks, a mountain of climbing waves.\nl
Page 491

Enormous was its vast and passionate voice.\nl
It cried to her listening spirit as it ran,\nl
Demanding God's submission to chainless Force.\nl
A deaf force calling to a status dumb,\nl
A thousand voices in a muted Vast,\nl
It claimed the heart's support for its clutch at joy,\nl
For its need to act the witness Soul's consent,\nl
For its lust of power her neutral being's seal.\nl
Into the wideness of her watching self\nl
It brought a grandiose gust of the Breath of Life;\nl
Its torrent carried the world's hopes and fears,\nl
All life's, all Nature's dissatisfied hungry cry,\nl
And the longing all eternity cannot fill.\nl
It called to the mountain secrecies of the soul\nl
And the miracle of the never-dying fire,\nl
It spoke to some first inexpressible ecstasy\nl
Hidden in the creative beat of Life;\nl
Out of the nether unseen deeps it tore\nl
Its lure and magic of disordered bliss,\nl
Into earth-light poured its maze of tangled charm\nl
And heady draught of Nature's primitive joy\nl
And the fire and mystery of forbidden delight\nl
Drunk from the world-libido's bottomless well,\nl
And the honey-sweet poison-wine of lust and death,\nl
But dreamed a vintage of glory of life's gods,\nl
And felt as celestial rapture's golden sting.\nl
The cycles of the infinity of desire\nl
And the mystique that made an unrealised world\nl
Wider than the known and closer than the unknown\nl
In which hunt for ever the hounds of mind and life,\nl
Tempted a deep dissatisfied urge within\nl
To long for the unfulfilled and ever far\nl
And make this life upon a limiting earth\nl
A climb towards summits vanishing in the void,\nl
A search for the glory of the impossible.\nl
It dreamed of that which never has been known,\nl
Page 492

It grasped at that which never has been won,\nl
It chased into an Elysian memory\nl
The charms that flee from the heart's soon lost delight;\nl
It dared the force that slays, the joys that hurt,\nl
The imaged shape of unaccomplished things\nl
And the summons to a Circean transmuting dance\nl
And passion's tenancy of the courts of love\nl
And the wild Beast's ramp and romp with Beauty and Life.\nl
It brought its cry and surge of opposite powers,\nl
Its moments of the touch of luminous planes,\nl
Its flame-ascensions and sky-pitched vast attempts,\nl
Its fiery towers of dream built on the winds,\nl
Its sinkings towards the darkness and the abyss,\nl
Its honey of tenderness, its sharp wine of hate,\nl
Its changes of sun and cloud, of laughter and tears,\nl
Its bottomless danger-pits and swallowing gulfs,\nl
Its fear and joy and ecstasy and despair,\nl
Its occult wizardries, its simple lines\nl
And great communions and uplifting moves,\nl
Its faith in heaven, its intercourse with hell.\nl
These powers were not blunt with the dead weight of earth,\nl
They gave ambrosia's taste and poison's sting.\nl
There was an ardour in the gaze of Life\nl
That saw heaven blue in the grey air of Night:\nl
The impulses godward soared on passion's wings.\nl
Mind's quick-paced thoughts floated from their high necks,\nl
A glowing splendour as of an irised mane,\nl
A parure of pure intuition's light;\nl
Its flame-foot gallop they could imitate:\nl
Mind's voices mimicked inspiration's stress,\nl
Its ictus of infallibility,\nl
Its speed and lightning heaven-leap of the Gods.\nl
A trenchant blade that shore the nets of doubt,\nl
Its sword of discernment seemed almost divine.\nl
Yet all that knowledge was a borrowed sun's;\nl
The forms that came were not heaven's native births:\nl
Page 493

An inner voice could speak the unreal's Word;\nl
Its puissance dangerous and absolute\nl
Could mingle poison with the wine of God.\nl
On these high shining backs falsehood could ride;\nl
Truth lay with delight in error's passionate arms\nl
Gliding downstream in a blithe gilded barge:\nl
She edged her ray with a magnificent lie.\nl
Here in Life's nether realms all contraries meet;\nl
Truth stares and does her works with bandaged eyes\nl
And Ignorance is Wisdom's patron here:\nl
Those galloping hooves in their enthusiast speed\nl
Could bear to a dangerous intermediate zone\nl
Where Death walks wearing a robe of deathless Life.\nl
Or they enter the valley of the wandering Gleam\nl
Whence, captives or victims of the specious Ray,\nl
Souls trapped in that region never can escape.\nl
Agents, not masters, they serve Life's desires\nl
Toiling for ever in the snare of Time.\nl
Their bodies born out of some Nihil's womb\nl
Ensnare the spirit in the moment's dreams,\nl
Then perish vomiting the immortal soul\nl
Out of Matter's belly into the sink of Nought.\nl
Yet some uncaught, unslain, can warily pass\nl
Carrying Truth's image in the sheltered heart,\nl
Pluck Knowledge out of error's screening grip,\nl
Break paths through the blind walls of little self,\nl
Then travel on to reach a greater life.\nl
All this streamed past her and seemed to her vision's sight\nl
As if around a high and voiceless isle\nl
A clamour of waters from far unknown hills\nl
Swallowed its narrow banks in crowding waves\nl
And made a hungry world of white wild foam:\nl
Hastening, a dragon with a million feet,\nl
Its foam and cry a drunken giant's din,\nl
Tossing a mane of Darkness into God's sky,\nl
It ebbed receding into a distant roar.\nl
Page 494

Then smiled again a large and tranquil air:\nl
Blue heaven, green earth, partners of Beauty's reign,\nl
Lived as of old, companions in happiness;\nl
And in the world's heart laughed the joy of life.\nl
All now was still, the soil shone dry and pure.\nl
Through it all she moved not, plunged not in the vain waves.\nl
Out of the vastness of the silent self\nl
Life's clamour fled; her spirit was mute and free.\nl

\spar Then journeying forward through the self's wide hush\nl
She came into a brilliant ordered Space.\nl
There Life dwelt parked in an armed tranquillity;\nl
A chain was on her strong insurgent heart.\nl
Tamed to the modesty of a measured pace,\nl
She kept no more her vehement stride and rush;\nl
She had lost the careless majesty of her muse\nl
And the ample grandeur of her regal force;\nl
Curbed were her mighty pomps, her splendid waste,\nl
Sobered the revels of her bacchant play,\nl
Cut down were her squanderings in desire's bazaar,\nl
Coerced her despot will, her fancy's dance,\nl
A cold stolidity bound the riot of sense.\nl
A royalty without freedom was her lot;\nl
The sovereign throned obeyed her ministers:\nl
Her servants mind and sense governed her house:\nl
Her spirit's bounds they cast in rigid lines\nl
And guarding with a phalanx of armoured rules\nl
The reason's balanced reign, kept order and peace.\nl
Her will lived closed in adamant walls of law,\nl
Coerced was her force by chains that feigned to adorn,\nl
Imagination was prisoned in a fort,\nl
Her wanton and licentious favourite;\nl
Reality's poise and reason's symmetry\nl
Were set in its place sentinelled by marshalled facts,\nl
They gave to the soul for throne a bench of Law,\nl
For kingdom a small world of rule and line:\nl
Page 495

The ages' wisdom, shrivelled to scholiast lines,\nl
Shrank patterned into a copy-book device.\nl
The Spirit's almighty freedom was not here:\nl
A schoolman mind had captured life's large space,\nl
But chose to live in bare and paltry rooms\nl
Parked off from the too vast dangerous universe,\nl
Fearing to lose its soul in the infinite.\nl
Even the Idea's ample sweep was cut\nl
Into a system, chained to fixed pillars of thought\nl
Or rivetted to Matter's solid ground:\nl
Or else the soul was lost in its own heights:\nl
Obeying the Ideal's high-browed law\nl
Thought based a throne on unsubstantial air\nl
Disdaining earth's flat triviality:\nl
It barred reality out to live in its dreams.\nl
Or all stepped into a systemed universe:\nl
Life's empire was a managed continent,\nl
Its thoughts an army ranked and disciplined;\nl
Uniformed they kept the logic of their fixed place\nl
At the bidding of the trained centurion mind.\nl
Or each stepped into its station like a star\nl
Or marched through fixed and constellated heavens\nl
Or kept its feudal rank among its peers\nl
In the sky's unchanging cosmic hierarchy.\nl
Or like a high-bred maiden with chaste eyes\nl
Forbidden to walk unveiled the public ways,\nl
She must in close secluded chambers move,\nl
Her feeling in cloisters live or gardened paths.\nl
Life was consigned to a safe level path,\nl
It dared not tempt the great and difficult heights\nl
Or climb to be neighbour to a lonely star\nl
Or skirt the danger of the precipice\nl
Or tempt the foam-curled breakers' perilous laugh,\nl
Adventure's lyrist, danger's amateur,\nl
Or into her chamber call some flaming god,\nl
Or leave the world's bounds and where no limits are\nl
Page 496

Meet with the heart's passion the Adorable\nl
Or set the world ablaze with the inner Fire.\nl
A chastened epithet in the prose of life,\nl
She must fill with colour just her sanctioned space,\nl
Not break out of the cabin of the idea\nl
Nor trespass into rhythms too high or vast.\nl
Even when it soared into ideal air,\nl
Thought's flight lost not itself in heaven's blue:\nl
It drew upon the skies a patterned flower\nl
Of disciplined beauty and harmonic light.\nl
A temperate vigilant spirit governed life:\nl
Its acts were tools of the considering thought,\nl
Too cold to take fire and set the world ablaze,\nl
Or the careful reason's diplomatic moves\nl
Testing the means to a prefigured end,\nl
Or at the highest pitch some calm Will's plan\nl
Or a strategy of some High Command within\nl
To conquer the secret treasures of the gods\nl
Or win for a masked king some glorious world,\nl
Not a reflex of the spontaneous self,\nl
An index of the being and its moods,\nl
A winging of conscious spirit, a sacrament\nl
Of life's communion with the still Supreme\nl
Or its pure movement on the Eternal's road.\nl
Or else for the body of some high Idea\nl
A house was built with too close-fitting bricks;\nl
Action and thought cemented made a wall\nl
Of small ideals limiting the soul.\nl
Even meditation mused on a narrow seat;\nl
And worship turned to an exclusive God,\nl
To the Universal in a chapel prayed\nl
Whose doors were shut against the universe;\nl
Or kneeled to the bodiless Impersonal\nl
A mind shut to the cry and fire of love:\nl
A rational religion dried the heart.\nl
It planned a smooth life's acts with ethics' rule\nl
Page 497

Or offered a cold and flameless sacrifice.\nl
The sacred Book lay on its sanctified desk\nl
Wrapped in interpretation's silken strings:\nl
A credo sealed up its spiritual sense.\nl

\spar Here was a quiet country of fixed mind,\nl
Here life no more was all nor passion's voice;\nl
The cry of sense had sunk into a hush.\nl
Soul was not there nor spirit but mind alone;\nl
Mind claimed to be the spirit and the soul.\nl
The spirit saw itself as form of mind,\nl
Lost itself in the glory of the thought,\nl
A light that made invisible the sun.\nl
Into a firm and settled space she came\nl
Where all was still and all things kept their place.\nl
Each found what it had sought and knew its aim.\nl
All had a final last stability.\nl
There one stood forth who bore authority\nl
On an important brow and held a rod;\nl
Command was incarnate in his gesture and tone;\nl
Tradition's petrified wisdom carved his speech,\nl
His sentences savoured the oracle.\nl
“Traveller or pilgrim of the inner world,\nl
Fortunate art thou to reach our brilliant air\nl
Flaming with thought's supreme finality.\nl
O aspirant to the perfect way of life,\nl
Here find it; rest from search and live at peace.\nl
Ours is the home of cosmic certainty.\nl
Here is the truth, God's harmony is here.\nl
Register thy name in the book of the elite,\nl
Admitted by the sanction of the few,\nl
Adopt thy station of knowledge, thy post in mind,\nl
Thy ticket of order draw in Life's bureau\nl
And praise thy fate that made thee one of ours.\nl
All here, docketed and tied, the mind can know,\nl
All schemed by law that God permits to life.\nl
Page 498

This is the end and there is no beyond.\nl
Here is the safety of the ultimate wall,\nl
Here is the clarity of the sword of Light,\nl
Here is the victory of a single Truth,\nl
Here burns the diamond of flawless bliss.\nl
A favourite of Heaven and Nature live.”\nl
But to the too satisfied and confident sage\nl
Savitri replied casting into his world\nl
Sight's deep release, the heart's questioning inner voice:\nl
For here the heart spoke not, only clear daylight\nl
Of intellect reigned here, limiting, cold, precise.\nl
“Happy are they who in this chaos of things,\nl
This coming and going of the feet of Time,\nl
Can find the single Truth, the eternal Law:\nl
Untouched they live by hope and doubt and fear.\nl
Happy are men anchored on fixed belief\nl
In this uncertain and ambiguous world,\nl
Or who have planted in the heart's rich soil\nl
One small grain of spiritual certitude.\nl
Happiest who stand on faith as on a rock.\nl
But I must pass leaving the ended search,\nl
Truth's rounded outcome firm, immutable\nl
And this harmonic building of world-fact,\nl
This ordered knowledge of apparent things.\nl
Here I can stay not, for I seek my soul.”\nl
None answered in that bright contented world,\nl
Or only turned on their accustomed way\nl
Astonished to hear questioning in that air\nl
Or thoughts that could still turn to the Beyond.\nl
But some murmured, passers-by from kindred spheres:\nl
Each by his credo judged the thought she spoke.\nl
“Who then is this who knows not that the soul\nl
Is a least gland or a secretion's fault\nl
Disquieting the sane government of the mind,\nl
Disordering the function of the brain,\nl
Or a yearning lodged in Nature's mortal house\nl
Page 499

Or dream whispered in man's cave of hollow thought\nl
Who would prolong his brief unhappy term\nl
Or cling to living in a sea of death?”\nl
But others, “Nay, it is her spirit she seeks.\nl
A splendid shadow of the name of God,\nl
A formless lustre from the Ideal's realm,\nl
The Spirit is the Holy Ghost of Mind;\nl
But none has touched its limbs or seen its face.\nl
Each soul is the great Father's crucified Son,\nl
Mind is that soul's one parent, its conscious cause,\nl
The ground on which trembles a brief passing light,\nl
Mind, sole creator of the apparent world.\nl
All that is here is part of our own self;\nl
Our minds have made the world in which we live.”\nl
Another with mystic and unsatisfied eyes\nl
Who loved his slain belief and mourned its death,\nl
“Is there one left who seeks for a Beyond?\nl
Can still the path be found, opened the gate?”\nl

\spar So she fared on across her silent self.\nl
To a road she came thronged with an ardent crowd\nl
Who sped brilliant, fire-footed, sunlight-eyed,\nl
Pressing to reach the world's mysterious wall,\nl
And pass through masked doorways into outer mind\nl
Where the Light comes not nor the mystic voice,\nl
Messengers from our subliminal greatnesses,\nl
Guests from the cavern of the secret soul.\nl
Into dim spiritual somnolence they break\nl
Or shed wide wonder on our waking self,\nl
Ideas that haunt us with their radiant tread,\nl
Dreams that are hints of unborn Reality,\nl
Strange goddesses with deep-pooled magical eyes,\nl
Strong wind-haired gods carrying the harps of hope,\nl
Great moon-hued visions gliding through gold air,\nl
Aspiration's sun-dream head and star-carved limbs,\nl
Emotions making common hearts sublime.\nl
Page 500

And Savitri mingling in that glorious crowd,\nl
Yearning to the spiritual light they bore,\nl
Longed once to hasten like them to save God's world;\nl
But she reined back the high passion in her heart;\nl
She knew that first she must discover her soul.\nl
Only who save themselves can others save.\nl
In contrary sense she faced life's riddling truth:\nl
They carrying the light to suffering men\nl
Hurried with eager feet to the outer world;\nl
Her eyes were turned towards the eternal source.\nl
Outstretching her hands to stay the throng she cried:\nl
“O happy company of luminous gods,\nl
Reveal, who know, the road that I must tread,—\nl
For surely that bright quarter is your home,—\nl
To find the birthplace of the occult Fire\nl
And the deep mansion of my secret soul.”\nl
One answered pointing to a silence dim\nl
On a remote extremity of sleep\nl
In some far background of the inner world.\nl
“O Savitri, from thy hidden soul we come.\nl
We are the messengers, the occult gods\nl
Who help men's drab and heavy ignorant lives\nl
To wake to beauty and the wonder of things\nl
Touching them with glory and divinity;\nl
In evil we light the deathless flame of good\nl
And hold the torch of knowledge on ignorant roads;\nl
We are thy will and all men's will towards Light.\nl
O human copy and disguise of God\nl
Who seekst the deity thou keepest hid\nl
And livest by the Truth thou hast not known,\nl
Follow the world's winding highway to its source.\nl
There in the silence few have ever reached,\nl
Thou shalt see the Fire burning on the bare stone\nl
And the deep cavern of thy secret soul.”\nl
Then Savitri following the great winding road\nl
Came where it dwindled into a narrow path\nl
Page 501

Trod only by rare wounded pilgrim feet.\nl
A few bright forms emerged from unknown depths\nl
And looked at her with calm immortal eyes.\nl
There was no sound to break the brooding hush;\nl
One felt the silent nearness of the soul.\nl

\par
\sbigcap Here from a low and prone and listless ground\nl
The passion of the first ascent began;\nl
A moon-bright face in a sombre cloud of hair,\nl
A Woman sat in a pale lustrous robe.\nl
A rugged and ragged soil was her bare seat,\nl
Beneath her feet a sharp and wounding stone.\nl
A divine pity on the peaks of the world,\nl
A spirit touched by the grief of all that lives,\nl
She looked out far and saw from inner mind\nl
This questionable world of outward things,\nl
Of false appearances and plausible shapes,\nl
This dubious cosmos stretched in the ignorant Void,\nl
The pangs of earth, the toil and speed of the stars\nl
And the difficult birth and dolorous end of life.\nl
Accepting the universe as her body of woe,\nl
The Mother of the seven sorrows bore\nl
The seven stabs that pierced her bleeding heart:\nl
The beauty of sadness lingered on her face,\nl
Her eyes were dim with the ancient stain of tears.\nl
Her heart was riven with the world's agony\nl
And burdened with the sorrow and struggle in Time,\nl
An anguished music trailed in her rapt voice.\nl
Absorbed in a deep compassion's ecstasy,\nl
Lifting the mild ray of her patient gaze,\nl
In soft sweet training words slowly she spoke:\nl
“O Savitri, I am thy secret soul.\nl
To share the suffering of the world I came,\nl
I draw my children's pangs into my breast.\nl
I am the nurse of the dolour beneath the stars;\nl
I am the soul of all who wailing writhe\nl
Under the ruthless harrow of the Gods.\nl
Page 503

I am woman, nurse and slave and beaten beast;\nl
I tend the hands that gave me cruel blows.\nl
The hearts that spurned my love and zeal I serve;\nl
I am the courted queen, the pampered doll,\nl
I am the giver of the bowl of rice,\nl
I am the worshipped Angel of the House.\nl
I am in all that suffers and that cries.\nl
Mine is the prayer that climbs in vain from earth,\nl
I am traversed by my creatures' agonies,\nl
I am the spirit in a world of pain.\nl
The scream of tortured flesh and tortured hearts\nl
Fall'n back on heart and flesh unheard by Heaven\nl
Has rent with helpless grief and wrath my soul.\nl
I have seen the peasant burning in his hut,\nl
I have seen the slashed corpse of the slaughtered child,\nl
Heard woman's cry ravished and stripped and haled\nl
Amid the bayings of the hell-hound mob,\nl
I have looked on, I had no power to save.\nl
I have brought no arm of strength to aid or slay;\nl
God gave me love, he gave me not his force.\nl
I have shared the toil of the yoked animal drudge\nl
Pushed by the goad, encouraged by the whip;\nl
I have shared the fear-filled life of bird and beast,\nl
Its long hunt for the day's precarious food,\nl
Its covert slink and crouch and hungry prowl,\nl
Its pain and terror seized by beak and claw.\nl
I have shared the daily life of common men,\nl
Its petty pleasures and its petty cares,\nl
Its press of troubles and haggard horde of ills,\nl
Earth's trail of sorrow hopeless of relief,\nl
The unwanted tedious labour without joy,\nl
And the burden of misery and the strokes of fate.\nl
I have been pity, leaning over pain\nl
And the tender smile that heals the wounded heart\nl
And sympathy making life less hard to bear.\nl
Man has felt near my unseen face and hands;\nl
Page 504

I have become the sufferer and his moan,\nl
I have lain down with the mangled and the slain,\nl
I have lived with the prisoner in his dungeon cell.\nl
Heavy on my shoulders weighs the yoke of Time:\nl
Nothing refusing of creation's load,\nl
I have borne all and know I still must bear:\nl
Perhaps when the world sinks into a last sleep,\nl
I too may sleep in dumb eternal peace.\nl
I have borne the calm indifference of Heaven,\nl
Watched Nature's cruelty to suffering things\nl
While God passed silent by nor turned to help.\nl
Yet have I cried not out against his will,\nl
Yet have I not accused his cosmic Law.\nl
Only to change this great hard world of pain\nl
A patient prayer has risen from my breast;\nl
A pallid resignation lights my brow,\nl
Within me a blind faith and mercy dwell;\nl
I carry the fire that never can be quenched\nl
And the compassion that supports the suns.\nl
I am the hope that looks towards my God,\nl
My God who never came to me till now;\nl
His voice I hear that ever says `I come':\nl
I know that one day he shall come at last.”\nl
She ceased, and like an echo from below\nl
Answering her pathos of divine complaint\nl
A voice of wrath took up the dire refrain,\nl
A growl of thunder or roar of angry beast,\nl
The beast that crouching growls within man's depths,—\nl
Voice of a tortured Titan once a God.\nl
“I am the Man of Sorrows, I am he\nl
Who is nailed on the wide cross of the universe;\nl
To enjoy my agony God built the earth,\nl
My passion he has made his drama's theme.\nl
He has sent me naked into his bitter world\nl
And beaten me with his rods of grief and pain\nl
That I might cry and grovel at his feet\nl
Page 505

And offer him worship with my blood and tears.\nl
I am Prometheus under the vulture's beak,\nl
Man the discoverer of the undying fire,\nl
In the flame he kindled burning like a moth;\nl
I am the seeker who can never find,\nl
I am the fighter who can never win,\nl
I am the runner who never touched his goal:\nl
Hell tortures me with the edges of my thought,\nl
Heaven tortures me with the splendour of my dreams.\nl
What profit have I of my animal birth;\nl
What profit have I of my human soul?\nl
I toil like the animal, like the animal die.\nl
I am man the rebel, man the helpless serf;\nl
Fate and my fellows cheat me of my wage.\nl
I loosen with my blood my servitude's seal\nl
And shake from my aching neck the oppressor's knees\nl
Only to seat new tyrants on my back:\nl
My teachers lesson me in slavery,\nl
I am shown God's stamp and my own signature\nl
Upon the sorry contract of my fate.\nl
I have loved, but none has loved me since my birth;\nl
My fruit of works is given to other hands.\nl
All that is left me is my evil thoughts,\nl
My sordid quarrel against God and man,\nl
Envy of the riches that I cannot share,\nl
Hate of a happiness that is not mine.\nl
I know my fate will ever be the same,\nl
It is my nature's work that cannot change:\nl
I have loved for mine, not for the beloved's sake,\nl
I have lived for myself and not for others' lives.\nl
Each in himself is sole by Nature's law.\nl
So God has made his harsh and dreadful world,\nl
So has he built the petty heart of man.\nl
Only by force and ruse can man survive:\nl
For pity is a weakness in his breast,\nl
His goodness is a laxity in the nerves,\nl
Page 506

His kindness an investment for return,\nl
His altruism is ego's other face:\nl
He serves the world that him the world may serve.\nl
If once the Titan's strength could wake in me,\nl
If Enceladus from Etna could arise,\nl
I then would reign the master of the world\nl
And like a god enjoy man's bliss and pain.\nl
But God has taken from me the ancient Force.\nl
There is a dull consent in my sluggish heart,\nl
A fierce satisfaction with my special pangs\nl
As if they made me taller than my kind;\nl
Only by suffering can I excel.\nl
I am the victim of titanic ills,\nl
I am the doer of demoniac deeds;\nl
I was made for evil, evil is my lot;\nl
Evil I must be and by evil live;\nl
Nought other can I do but be myself;\nl
What Nature made me, that I must remain.\nl
I suffer and toil and weep; I moan and hate.”\nl
And Savitri heard the voice, the echo heard\nl
And turning to her being of pity spoke:\nl
“Madonna of suffering, Mother of grief divine,\nl
Thou art a portion of my soul put forth\nl
To bear the unbearable sorrow of the world.\nl
Because thou art, men yield not to their doom,\nl
But ask for happiness and strive with fate;\nl
Because thou art, the wretched still can hope.\nl
But thine is the power to solace, not to save.\nl
One day I will return, a bringer of strength,\nl
And make thee drink from the Eternal's cup;\nl
His streams of force shall triumph in thy limbs\nl
And Wisdom's calm control thy passionate heart.\nl
Thy love shall be the bond of humankind,\nl
Compassion the bright key of Nature's acts:\nl
Misery shall pass abolished from the earth;\nl
The world shall be freed from the anger of the Beast,\nl
Page 507

From the cruelty of the Titan and his pain.\nl
There shall be peace and joy for ever more.”\nl

\spar On passed she in her spirit's upward route.\nl
An ardent grandeur climbed mid ferns and rocks,\nl
A quiet wind flattered the heart to warmth,\nl
A finer perfume breathed from slender trees.\nl
All beautiful grew, subtle and high and strange.\nl
Here on a boulder carved like a huge throne\nl
A Woman sat in gold and purple sheen,\nl
Armed with the trident and the thunderbolt,\nl
Her feet upon a couchant lion's back.\nl
A formidable smile curved round her lips,\nl
Heaven-fire laughed in the corners of her eyes;\nl
Her body a mass of courage and heavenly strength,\nl
She menaced the triumph of the nether gods.\nl
A halo of lightnings flamed around her head\nl
And sovereignty, a great cestus, zoned her robe\nl
And majesty and victory sat with her\nl
Guarding in the wide cosmic battlefield\nl
Against the flat equality of Death\nl
And the all-levelling insurgent Night\nl
The hierarchy of the ordered Powers,\nl
The high changeless values, the peaked eminences,\nl
The privileged aristocracy of Truth,\nl
And in the governing Ideal's sun\nl
The triumvirate of wisdom, love and bliss\nl
And the sole autocracy of the absolute Light.\nl
August on her seat in the inner world of Mind,\nl
The Mother of Might looked down on passing things,\nl
Listened to the advancing tread of Time,\nl
Saw the irresistible wheeling of the suns\nl
And heard the thunder of the march of God.\nl
Amid the swaying Forces in their strife\nl
Sovereign was her word of luminous command,\nl
Her speech like a war-cry rang or a pilgrim chant.\nl
Page 508

A charm restoring hope in failing hearts\nl
Aspired the harmony of her puissant voice:\nl
“O Savitri, I am thy secret soul.\nl
I have come down into the human world\nl
And the movement watched by an unsleeping Eye\nl
And the dark contrariety of earth's fate\nl
And the battle of the bright and sombre Powers.\nl
I stand upon earth's paths of danger and grief\nl
And help the unfortunate and save the doomed.\nl
To the strong I bring the guerdon of their strength,\nl
To the weak I bring the armour of my force;\nl
To men who long I carry their coveted joy:\nl
I am fortune justifying the great and wise\nl
By the sanction of the plaudits of the crowd,\nl
Then trampling them with the armed heel of fate.\nl
My ear is leaned to the cry of the oppressed,\nl
I topple down the thrones of tyrant kings:\nl
A cry comes from proscribed and hunted lives\nl
Appealing to me against a pitiless world,\nl
A voice of the forsaken and desolate\nl
And the lone prisoner in his dungeon cell.\nl
Men hail in my coming the Almighty's force\nl
Or praise with thankful tears his saviour Grace.\nl
I smite the Titan who bestrides the world\nl
And slay the ogre in his blood-stained den.\nl
I am Durga, goddess of the proud and strong,\nl
And Lakshmi, queen of the fair and fortunate;\nl
I wear the face of Kali when I kill,\nl
I trample the corpses of the demon hordes.\nl
I am charged by God to do his mighty work,\nl
Uncaring I serve his will who sent me forth,\nl
Reckless of peril and earthly consequence.\nl
I reason not of virtue and of sin\nl
But do the deed he has put into my heart.\nl
I fear not for the angry frown of Heaven,\nl
I flinch not from the red assault of Hell;\nl
Page 509

I crush the opposition of the gods,\nl
Tread down a million goblin obstacles.\nl
I guide man to the path of the Divine\nl
And guard him from the red Wolf and the Snake.\nl
I set in his mortal hand my heavenly sword\nl
And put on him the breastplate of the gods.\nl
I break the ignorant pride of human mind\nl
And lead the thought to the wideness of the Truth;\nl
I rend man's narrow and successful life\nl
And force his sorrowful eyes to gaze at the sun\nl
That he may die to earth and live in his soul.\nl
I know the goal, I know the secret route;\nl
I have studied the map of the invisible worlds;\nl
I am the battle's head, the journey's star.\nl
But the great obstinate world resists my Word,\nl
And the crookedness and evil in man's heart\nl
Is stronger than Reason, profounder than the Pit,\nl
And the malignancy of hostile Powers\nl
Puts craftily back the clock of destiny\nl
And mightier seems than the eternal Will.\nl
The cosmic evil is too deep to unroot,\nl
The cosmic suffering is too vast to heal.\nl
A few I guide who pass me towards the Light;\nl
A few I save, the mass falls back unsaved;\nl
A few I help, the many strive and fail.\nl
But my heart I have hardened and I do my work:\nl
Slowly the light grows greater in the East,\nl
Slowly the world progresses on God's road.\nl
His seal is on my task, it cannot fail:\nl
I shall hear the silver swing of heaven's gates\nl
When God comes out to meet the soul of the world.”\nl
She spoke and from the lower human world\nl
An answer, a warped echo met her speech;\nl
The voice came through the spaces of the mind\nl
Of the dwarf-Titan, the deformed chained god\nl
Who strives to master his nature's rebel stuff\nl
Page 510

And make the universe his instrument.\nl
The Ego of this great world of desire\nl
Claimed earth and the wide heavens for the use\nl
Of man, head of the life it shapes on earth,\nl
Its representative and conscious soul,\nl
And symbol of evolving light and force\nl
And vessel of the godhead that must be.\nl
A thinking animal, Nature's struggling lord,\nl
Has made of her his nurse and tool and slave\nl
And pays to her as wage and emolument\nl
Inescapably by a deep law in things\nl
His heart's grief and his body's death and pain:\nl
His pains are her means to grow, to see and feel;\nl
His death assists her immortality.\nl
A tool and slave of his own slave and tool,\nl
He praises his free will and his master mind\nl
And is pushed by her upon her chosen paths;\nl
Possessor he is possessed and, ruler, ruled,\nl
Her conscious automaton, her desire's dupe.\nl
His soul is her guest, a sovereign mute, inert,\nl
His body her robot, his life her way to live,\nl
His conscious mind her strong revolted serf.\nl
The voice rose up and smote some inner sun.\nl
“I am the heir of the forces of the earth,\nl
Slowly I make good my right to my estate;\nl
A growing godhead in her divinised mud,\nl
I climb, a claimant to the throne of heaven.\nl
The last-born of the earth I stand the first;\nl
Her slow millenniums waited for my birth.\nl
Although I live in Time besieged by Death,\nl
Precarious owner of my body and soul\nl
Housed on a little speck amid the stars,\nl
For me and my use the universe was made.\nl
Immortal spirit in the perishing clay,\nl
I am God still unevolved in human form;\nl
Even if he is not, he becomes in me.\nl
Page 511

The sun and moon are lights upon my path;\nl
Air was invented for my lungs to breathe,\nl
Conditioned as a wide and wall-less space\nl
For my winged chariot's wheels to cleave a road,\nl
The sea was made for me to swim and sail\nl
And bear my golden commerce on its back:\nl
It laughs cloven by my pleasure's gliding keel,\nl
I laugh at its black stare of fate and death.\nl
The earth is my floor, the sky my living's roof.\nl
All was prepared through many a silent age,\nl
God made experiments with animal shapes,\nl
Then only when all was ready I was born.\nl
I was born weak and small and ignorant,\nl
A helpless creature in a difficult world\nl
Travelling through my brief years with death at my side;\nl
I have grown greater than Nature, wiser than God.\nl
I have made real what she never dreamed,\nl
I have seized her powers and harnessed for my work,\nl
I have shaped her metals and new metals made;\nl
I will make glass and raiment out of milk,\nl
Make iron velvet, water unbreakable stone,\nl
Like God in his astuce of artist skill,\nl
Mould from one primal plasm protean forms,\nl
In single Nature multitudinous lives,\nl
All that imagination can conceive\nl
In mind intangible, remould anew\nl
In Matter's plastic solid and concrete.\nl
No magic can surpass my magic's skill.\nl
There is no miracle I shall not achieve.\nl
What God imperfect left, I will complete,\nl
Out of a tangled mind and half-made soul\nl
His sin and error I will eliminate;\nl
What he invented not, I shall invent:\nl
He was the first creator, I am the last.\nl
I have found the atoms from which he built the worlds:\nl
The first tremendous cosmic energy\nl
Page 512

Missioned shall leap to slay my enemy kin,\nl
Expunge a nation or abolish a race,\nl
Death's silence leave where there was laughter and joy.\nl
Or the fissured invisible shall spend God's force\nl
To extend my comforts and expand my wealth,\nl
To speed my car which now the lightnings drive\nl
And turn the engines of my miracles.\nl
I will take his means of sorcery from his hands\nl
And do with them greater wonders than his best.\nl
Yet through it all I have kept my balanced thought;\nl
I have studied my being, I have examined the world,\nl
I have grown a master of the arts of life.\nl
I have tamed the wild beast, trained to be my friend;\nl
He guards my house, looks up waiting my will.\nl
I have taught my kind to serve and to obey.\nl
I have used the mystery of the cosmic waves\nl
To see far distance and to hear far words;\nl
I have conquered Space and knitted close all earth.\nl
Soon I shall know the secrets of the Mind;\nl
I play with knowledge and with ignorance\nl
And sin and virtue my inventions are\nl
I can transcend or sovereignly use.\nl
I shall know mystic truths, seize occult powers.\nl
I shall slay my enemies with a look or thought,\nl
I shall sense the unspoken feelings of all hearts\nl
And see and hear the hidden thoughts of men.\nl
When earth is mastered, I shall conquer heaven;\nl
The gods shall be my aides or menial folk,\nl
No wish I harbour unfulfilled shall die:\nl
Omnipotence and omniscience shall be mine.”\nl
And Savitri heard the voice, the warped echo heard\nl
And turning to her being of power she spoke:\nl
“Madonna of might, Mother of works and force,\nl
Thou art a portion of my soul put forth\nl
To help mankind and help the travail of Time.\nl
Because thou art in him, man hopes and dares;\nl
Page 513

Because thou art, men's souls can climb the heavens\nl
And walk like gods in the presence of the Supreme.\nl
But without wisdom power is like a wind,\nl
It can breathe upon the heights and kiss the sky,\nl
It cannot build the extreme eternal things.\nl
Thou hast given men strength, wisdom thou couldst not give.\nl
One day I will return, a bringer of light;\nl
Then will I give to thee the mirror of God;\nl
Thou shalt see self and world as by him they are seen\nl
Reflected in the bright pool of thy soul.\nl
Thy wisdom shall be vast as vast thy power.\nl
Then hate shall dwell no more in human hearts,\nl
And fear and weakness shall desert men's lives,\nl
The cry of the ego shall be hushed within,\nl
Its lion roar that claims the world as food,\nl
All shall be might and bliss and happy force.”\nl

\spar Ascending still her spirit's upward route\nl
She came into a high and happy space,\nl
A wide tower of vision whence all could be seen\nl
And all was centred in a single view\nl
As when by distance separate scenes grow one\nl
And a harmony is made of hues at war.\nl
The wind was still and fragrance packed the air.\nl
There was a carol of birds and murmur of bees,\nl
And all that is common and natural and sweet,\nl
Yet intimately divine to heart and soul.\nl
A nearness thrilled of the spirit to its source\nl
And deepest things seemed obvious, close and true.\nl
Here, living centre of that vision of peace,\nl
A Woman sat in clear and crystal light:\nl
Heaven had unveiled its lustre in her eyes,\nl
Her feet were moonbeams, her face was a bright sun,\nl
Her smile could persuade a dead lacerated heart\nl
To live again and feel the hands of calm.\nl
A low music heard became her floating voice:\nl
Page 514

“O Savitri, I am thy secret soul.\nl
I have come down to the wounded desolate earth\nl
To heal her pangs and lull her heart to rest\nl
And lay her head upon the Mother's lap\nl
That she may dream of God and know his peace\nl
And draw the harmony of higher spheres\nl
Into the rhythm of earth's rude troubled days.\nl
I show to her the figures of bright gods\nl
And bring strength and solace to her struggling life;\nl
High things that now are only words and forms\nl
I reveal to her in the body of their power.\nl
I am peace that steals into man's war-worn breast,\nl
Amid the reign of Hell his acts create\nl
A hostel where Heaven's messengers can lodge;\nl
I am charity with the kindly hands that bless,\nl
I am silence mid the noisy tramp of life;\nl
I am Knowledge poring on her cosmic map.\nl
In the anomalies of the human heart\nl
Where Good and Evil are close bedfellows\nl
And Light is by Darkness dogged at every step,\nl
Where his largest knowledge is an ignorance,\nl
I am the Power that labours towards the best\nl
And works for God and looks up towards the heights.\nl
I make even sin and error stepping-stones\nl
And all experience a long march towards Light.\nl
Out of the Inconscient I build consciousness,\nl
And lead through death to reach immortal Life.\nl
Many are God's forms by which he grows in man;\nl
They stamp his thoughts and deeds with divinity,\nl
Uplift the stature of the human clay\nl
Or slowly transmute it into heaven's gold.\nl
He is the Good for which men fight and die,\nl
He is the war of Right with Titan wrong;\nl
He is Freedom rising deathless from her pyre;\nl
He is Valour guarding still the desperate pass\nl
Or lone and erect on the shattered barricade\nl
Page 515

Or a sentinel in the dangerous echoing Night.\nl
He is the crown of the martyr burned in flame\nl
And the glad resignation of the saint\nl
And courage indifferent to the wounds of Time\nl
And the hero's might wrestling with death and fate.\nl
He is Wisdom incarnate on a glorious throne\nl
And the calm autocracy of the sage's rule.\nl
He is the high and solitary Thought\nl
Aloof above the ignorant multitude:\nl
He is the prophet's voice, the sight of the seer.\nl
He is Beauty, nectar of the passionate soul,\nl
He is the Truth by which the spirit lives.\nl
He is the riches of the spiritual Vast\nl
Poured out in healing streams on indigent Life;\nl
He is Eternity lured from hour to hour,\nl
He is infinity in a little space:\nl
He is immortality in the arms of death.\nl
These powers I am and at my call they come.\nl
Thus slowly I lift man's soul nearer the Light.\nl
But human mind clings to its ignorance\nl
And to its littleness the human heart\nl
And to its right to grief the earthly life.\nl
Only when Eternity takes Time by the hand,\nl
Only when infinity weds the finite's thought,\nl
Can man be free from himself and live with God.\nl
I bring meanwhile the gods upon the earth;\nl
I bring back hope to the despairing heart;\nl
I give peace to the humble and the great,\nl
And shed my grace on the foolish and the wise.\nl
I shall save earth, if earth consents to be saved.\nl
Then Love shall at last unwounded tread earth's soil;\nl
Man's mind shall admit the sovereignty of Truth\nl
And body bear the immense descent of God.”\nl
She spoke and from the ignorant nether plane\nl
A cry, a warped echo naked and shuddering came.\nl
A voice of the sense-shackled human mind\nl
Page 516

Carried its proud complaint of godlike power\nl
Hedged by the limits of a mortal's thoughts,\nl
Bound in the chains of earthly ignorance.\nl
Imprisoned in his body and his brain\nl
The mortal cannot see God's mighty whole,\nl
Or share in his vast and deep identity\nl
Who stands unguessed within our ignorant hearts\nl
And knows all things because he is one with all.\nl
Man only sees the cosmic surfaces.\nl
Then wondering what may lie hid from the sense\nl
A little way he delves to depths below:\nl
But soon he stops, he cannot reach life's core\nl
Or commune with the throbbing heart of things.\nl
He sees the naked body of the Truth\nl
Though often baffled by her endless garbs,\nl
But cannot look upon her soul within.\nl
Then, furious for a knowledge absolute,\nl
He tears all details out and stabs and digs:\nl
Only the shape's contents he holds for use;\nl
The spirit escapes or dies beneath his knife.\nl
He sees as a blank stretch, a giant waste\nl
The crowding riches of infinity.\nl
The finite he has made his central field,\nl
Its plan dissects, masters its processes,\nl
That which moves all is hidden from his gaze,\nl
His poring eyes miss the unseen behind.\nl
He has the blind man's subtle unerring touch\nl
Or the slow traveller's sight of distant scenes;\nl
The soul's revealing contacts are not his.\nl
Yet is he visited by intuitive light\nl
And inspiration comes from the Unknown;\nl
But only reason and sense he feels as sure,\nl
They only are his trusted witnesses.\nl
Thus is he baulked, his splendid effort vain;\nl
His knowledge scans bright pebbles on the shore\nl
Of the huge ocean of his ignorance.\nl
Page 517

Yet grandiose were the accents of that cry,\nl
A cosmic pathos trembled in its tone.\nl
“I am the mind of God's great ignorant world\nl
Ascending to knowledge by the steps he made;\nl
I am the all-discovering Thought of man.\nl
I am a god fettered by Matter and sense,\nl
An animal prisoned in a fence of thorns,\nl
A beast of labour asking for his food,\nl
A smith tied to his anvil and his forge.\nl
Yet have I loosened the cord, enlarged my room.\nl
I have mapped the heavens and analysed the stars,\nl
Described their orbits through the grooves of Space,\nl
Measured the miles that separate the suns,\nl
Computed their longevity in Time.\nl
I have delved into earth's bowels and torn out\nl
The riches guarded by her dull brown soil.\nl
I have classed the changes of her stony crust\nl
And of her biography discovered the dates,\nl
Rescued the pages of all Nature's plan.\nl
The tree of evolution I have sketched,\nl
Each branch and twig and leaf in its own place,\nl
In the embryo tracked the history of forms,\nl
And the genealogy framed of all that lives.\nl
I have detected plasm and cell and gene,\nl
The protozoa traced, man's ancestors,\nl
The humble originals from whom he rose;\nl
I know how he was born and how he dies:\nl
Only what end he serves I know not yet\nl
Or if there is aim at all or any end\nl
Or push of rich creative purposeful joy\nl
In the wide works of the terrestrial power.\nl
I have caught her intricate processes, none is left:\nl
Her huge machinery is in my hands;\nl
I have seized the cosmic energies for my use.\nl
I have pored on her infinitesimal elements\nl
And her invisible atoms have unmasked:\nl
Page 518

All Matter is a book I have perused;\nl
Only some pages now are left to read.\nl
I have seen the ways of life, the paths of mind;\nl
I have studied the methods of the ant and ape\nl
And the behaviour learned of man and worm.\nl
If God is at work, his secrets I have found.\nl
But still the Cause of things is left in doubt,\nl
Their truth flees from pursuit into a void;\nl
When all has been explained nothing is known.\nl
What chose the process, whence the Power sprang\nl
I know not and perhaps shall never know.\nl
A mystery is this mighty Nature's birth;\nl
A mystery is the elusive stream of mind,\nl
A mystery the protean freak of life.\nl
What I have learned, Chance leaps to contradict;\nl
What I have built is seized and torn by Fate.\nl
I can foresee the acts of Matter's force,\nl
But not the march of the destiny of man:\nl
He is driven upon paths he did not choose,\nl
He falls trampled underneath the rolling wheels.\nl
My great philosophies are a reasoned guess;\nl
The mystic heavens that claim the human soul\nl
Are a charlatanism of the imagining brain:\nl
All is a speculation or a dream.\nl
In the end the world itself becomes a doubt:\nl
The infinitesimal's jest mocks mass and shape,\nl
A laugh peals from the infinite's finite mask.\nl
Perhaps the world is an error of our sight,\nl
A trick repeated in each flash of sense,\nl
An unreal mind hallucinates the soul\nl
With a stress-vision of false reality,\nl
Or a dance of Maya veils the void Unborn.\nl
Even if a greater consciousness I could reach,\nl
What profit is it then for Thought to win\nl
A Real which is for ever ineffable\nl
Or hunt to its lair the bodiless Self or make\nl
Page 519

The Unknowable the target of the soul?\nl
Nay, let me work within my mortal bounds,\nl
Not live beyond life nor think beyond the mind;\nl
Our smallness saves us from the Infinite.\nl
In a frozen grandeur lone and desolate\nl
Call me not to die the great eternal death,\nl
Left naked of my own humanity\nl
In the chill vast of the spirit's boundlessness.\nl
Each creature by its nature's limits lives,\nl
And how can one evade his native fate?\nl
Human I am, human let me remain\nl
Till in the Inconscient I fall dumb and sleep.\nl
A high insanity, a chimaera is this,\nl
To think that God lives hidden in the clay\nl
And that eternal Truth can dwell in Time,\nl
And call to her to save our self and world.\nl
How can man grow immortal and divine\nl
Transmuting the very stuff of which he is made?\nl
This wizard gods may dream, not thinking men.”\nl
\sparn And Savitri heard the voice, the warped answer heard\nl
And turning to her being of light she spoke:\nl
“Madonna of light, Mother of joy and peace,\nl
Thou art a portion of my self put forth\nl
To raise the spirit to its forgotten heights\nl
And wake the soul by touches of the heavens.\nl
Because thou art, the soul draws near to God;\nl
Because thou art, love grows in spite of hate\nl
And knowledge walks unslain in the pit of Night.\nl
But not by showering heaven's golden rain\nl
Upon the intellect's hard and rocky soil\nl
Can the tree of Paradise flower on earthly ground\nl
And the Bird of Paradise sit upon life's boughs\nl
And the winds of Paradise visit mortal air.\nl
Even if thou rain down intuition's rays,\nl
The mind of man will think it earth's own gleam,\nl
His spirit by spiritual ego sink,\nl
Page 520

Or his soul dream shut in sainthood's brilliant cell\nl
Where only a bright shadow of God can come.\nl
His hunger for the eternal thou must nurse\nl
And fill his yearning heart with heaven's fire\nl
And bring God down into his body and life.\nl
One day I will return, His hand in mine,\nl
And thou shalt see the face of the Absolute.\nl
Then shall the holy marriage be achieved,\nl
Then shall the divine family be born.\nl
There shall be light and peace in all the worlds.”\nl

\ht Canto Five: The Finding of the Soul
\par
\sbigcap Onward she passed seeking the soul's mystic cave.\nl
At first she stepped into a night of God.\nl
The light was quenched that helps the labouring world,\nl
The power that struggles and stumbles in our life;\nl
This inefficient mind gave up its thoughts,\nl
The striving heart its unavailing hopes.\nl
All knowledge failed and the Idea's forms\nl
And Wisdom screened in awe her lowly head\nl
Feeling a Truth too great for thought or speech,\nl
Formless, ineffable, for ever the same.\nl
An innocent and holy Ignorance\nl
Adored like one who worships formless God\nl
The unseen Light she could not claim nor own.\nl
In a simple purity of emptiness\nl
Her mind knelt down before the unknowable.\nl
All was abolished save her naked self\nl
And the prostrate yearning of her surrendered heart:\nl
There was no strength in her, no pride of force;\nl
The lofty burning of desire had sunk\nl
Ashamed, a vanity of separate self,\nl
The hope of spiritual greatness fled,\nl
Salvation she asked not nor a heavenly crown:\nl
Humility seemed now too proud a state.\nl
Her self was nothing, God alone was all,\nl
Yet God she knew not but only knew he was.\nl
A sacred darkness brooded now within,\nl
The world was a deep darkness great and nude.\nl
This void held more than all the teeming worlds,\nl
This blank felt more than all that Time has borne,\nl
This dark knew dumbly, immensely the Unknown.\nl
But all was formless, voiceless, infinite.\nl
Page 522

As might a shadow walk in a shadowy scene,\nl
A small nought passing through a mightier Nought,\nl
A night of person in a bare outline\nl
Crossing a fathomless impersonal Night,\nl
Silent she moved, empty and absolute.\nl
In endless Time her soul reached a wide end,\nl
The spaceless Vast became her spirit's place.\nl
At last a change approached, the emptiness broke;\nl
A wave rippled within, the world had stirred;\nl
Once more her inner self became her space.\nl
There was felt a blissful nearness to the goal;\nl
Heaven leaned low to kiss the sacred hill,\nl
The air trembled with passion and delight.\nl
A rose of splendour on a tree of dreams,\nl
The face of Dawn out of mooned twilight grew.\nl
Day came, priest of a sacrifice of joy\nl
Into the worshipping silence of her world;\nl
He carried immortal lustre as his robe,\nl
Trailed heaven like a purple scarf and wore\nl
As his vermilion caste-mark a red sun.\nl
As if an old remembered dream come true,\nl
She recognised in her prophetic mind\nl
The imperishable lustre of that sky,\nl
The tremulous sweetness of that happy air\nl
And, covered from mind's view and life's approach,\nl
The mystic cavern in the sacred hill\nl
And knew the dwelling of her secret soul.\nl
As if in some Elysian occult depth,\nl
Truth's last retreat from thought's profaning touch,\nl
As if in a rock-temple's solitude hid,\nl
God's refuge from an ignorant worshipping world,\nl
It lay withdrawn even from life's inner sense,\nl
Receding from the entangled heart's desire.\nl
A marvellous brooding twilight met the eyes\nl
And a holy stillness held that voiceless space.\nl
An awful dimness wrapped the great rock-doors\nl
Page 523

Carved in the massive stone of Matter's trance.\nl
Two golden serpents round the lintel curled,\nl
Enveloping it with their pure and dreadful strength,\nl
Looked out with wisdom's deep and luminous eyes.\nl
An eagle covered it with wide conquering wings:\nl
Flames of self-lost immobile reverie,\nl
Doves crowded the grey musing cornices\nl
Like sculptured postures of white-bosomed peace.\nl
Across the threshold's sleep she entered in\nl
And found herself amid great figures of gods\nl
Conscious in stone and living without breath,\nl
Watching with fixed regard the soul of man,\nl
Executive figures of the cosmic self,\nl
World-symbols of immutable potency.\nl
On the walls covered with significant shapes\nl
Looked at her the life-scene of man and beast\nl
And the high meaning of the life of gods,\nl
The power and necessity of these numberless worlds,\nl
And faces of beings and stretches of world-space\nl
Spoke the succinct and inexhaustible\nl
Hieratic message of the climbing planes.\nl
In their immensitude signing infinity\nl
They were the extension of the self of God\nl
And housed, impassively receiving all,\nl
His figures and his small and mighty acts\nl
And his passion and his birth and life and death\nl
And his return to immortality.\nl
To the abiding and eternal is their climb,\nl
To the pure existence everywhere the same,\nl
To the sheer consciousness and the absolute force\nl
And the unimaginable and formless bliss,\nl
To the mirth in Time and the timeless mystery\nl
Of the triune being who is all and one\nl
And yet is no one but himself apart.\nl
There was no step of breathing men, no sound,\nl
Only the living nearness of the soul.\nl
Page 524

Yet all the worlds and God himself were there,\nl
For every symbol was a reality\nl
And brought the presence which had given it life.\nl
All this she saw and inly felt and knew\nl
Not by some thought of mind but by the self.\nl
A light not born of sun or moon or fire,\nl
A light that dwelt within and saw within\nl
Shedding an intimate visibility\nl
Made secrecy more revealing than the word:\nl
Our sight and sense are a fallible gaze and touch\nl
And only the spirit's vision is wholly true.\nl
As thus she passed in that mysterious place\nl
Through room and room, through door and rock-hewn door,\nl
She felt herself made one with all she saw.\nl
A sealed identity within her woke;\nl
She knew herself the Beloved of the Supreme:\nl
These Gods and Goddesses were he and she:\nl
The Mother was she of Beauty and Delight,\nl
The Word in Brahma's vast creating clasp,\nl
The World-Puissance on almighty Shiva's lap,—\nl
The Master and the Mother of all lives\nl
Watching the worlds their twin regard had made,\nl
And Krishna and Radha for ever entwined in bliss,\nl
The Adorer and Adored self-lost and one.\nl
In the last chamber on a golden seat\nl
One sat whose shape no vision could define;\nl
Only one felt the world's unattainable fount,\nl
A Power of which she was a straying Force,\nl
An invisible Beauty, goal of the world's desire,\nl
A Sun of which all knowledge is a beam,\nl
A Greatness without whom no life could be.\nl
Thence all departed into silent self,\nl
And all became formless and pure and bare.\nl
Then through a tunnel dug in the last rock\nl
She came out where there shone a deathless sun.\nl
A house was there all made of flame and light\nl
Page 525

And crossing a wall of doorless living fire\nl
There suddenly she met her secret soul.\nl

\spar A being stood immortal in transience,\nl
Deathless dallying with momentary things,\nl
In whose wide eyes of tranquil happiness\nl
Which pity and sorrow could not abrogate\nl
Infinity turned its gaze on finite shapes:\nl
Observer of the silent steps of the hours,\nl
Eternity upheld the minute's acts\nl
And the passing scenes of the Everlasting's play.\nl
In the mystery of its selecting will,\nl
In the Divine Comedy a participant,\nl
The Spirit's conscious representative,\nl
God's delegate in our humanity,\nl
Comrade of the universe, the Transcendent's ray,\nl
She had come into the mortal body's room\nl
To play at ball with Time and Circumstance.\nl
A joy in the world her master movement here,\nl
The passion of the game lighted her eyes:\nl
A smile on her lips welcomed earth's bliss and grief,\nl
A laugh was her return to pleasure and pain.\nl
All things she saw as a masquerade of Truth\nl
Disguised in the costumes of Ignorance,\nl
Crossing the years to immortality;\nl
All she could front with the strong spirit's peace.\nl
But since she knows the toil of mind and life\nl
As a mother feels and shares her children's lives,\nl
She puts forth a small portion of herself,\nl
A being no bigger than the thumb of man\nl
Into a hidden region of the heart\nl
To face the pang and to forget the bliss,\nl
To share the suffering and endure earth's wounds\nl
And labour mid the labour of the stars.\nl
This in us laughs and weeps, suffers the stroke,\nl
Exults in victory, struggles for the crown;\nl
Page 526

Identified with the mind and body and life,\nl
It takes on itself their anguish and defeat,\nl
Bleeds with Fate's whips and hangs upon the cross,\nl
Yet is the unwounded and immortal self\nl
Supporting the actor in the human scene.\nl
Through this she sends us her glory and her powers,\nl
Pushes to wisdom's heights, through misery's gulfs;\nl
She gives us strength to do our daily task\nl
And sympathy that partakes of others' grief\nl
And the little strength we have to help our race,\nl
We who must fill the role of the universe\nl
Acting itself out in a slight human shape\nl
And on our shoulders carry the struggling world.\nl
This is in us the godhead small and marred;\nl
In this human portion of divinity\nl
She seats the greatness of the Soul in Time\nl
To uplift from light to light, from power to power,\nl
Till on a heavenly peak it stands, a king.\nl
In body weak, in its heart an invincible might,\nl
It climbs stumbling, held up by an unseen hand,\nl
A toiling spirit in a mortal shape.\nl
Here in this chamber of flame and light they met;\nl
They looked upon each other, knew themselves,\nl
The secret deity and its human part,\nl
The calm immortal and the struggling soul.\nl
Then with a magic transformation's speed\nl
They rushed into each other and grew one.\nl

\spar Once more she was human upon earthly soil\nl
In the muttering night amid the rain-swept woods\nl
And the rude cottage where she sat in trance:\nl
That subtle world withdrew deeply within\nl
Behind the sun-veil of the inner sight.\nl
But now the half-opened lotus bud of her heart\nl
Had bloomed and stood disclosed to the earthly ray;\nl
In an image shone revealed her secret soul.\nl
Page 527

There was no wall severing the soul and mind,\nl
No mystic fence guarding from the claims of life.\nl
In its deep lotus home her being sat\nl
As if on concentration's marble seat,\nl
Calling the mighty Mother of the worlds\nl
To make this earthly tenement her house.\nl
As in a flash from a supernal light,\nl
A living image of the original Power,\nl
A face, a form came down into her heart\nl
And made of it its temple and pure abode.\nl
But when its feet had touched the quivering bloom,\nl
A mighty movement rocked the inner space\nl
As if a world were shaken and found its soul:\nl
Out of the Inconscient's soulless mindless night\nl
A flaming Serpent rose released from sleep.\nl
It rose billowing its coils and stood erect\nl
And climbing mightily, stormily on its way\nl
It touched her centres with its flaming mouth;\nl
As if a fiery kiss had broken their sleep,\nl
They bloomed and laughed surcharged with light and bliss.\nl
Then at the crown it joined the Eternal's space.\nl
In the flower of the head, in the flower of Matter's base,\nl
In each divine stronghold and Nature-knot\nl
It held together the mystic stream which joins\nl
The viewless summits with the unseen depths,\nl
The string of forts that make the frail defence\nl
Safeguarding us against the enormous world,\nl
Our lines of self-expression in its Vast.\nl
An image sat of the original Power\nl
Wearing the mighty Mother's form and face.\nl
Armed, bearer of the weapon and the sign\nl
Whose occult might no magic can imitate,\nl
Manifold yet one she sat, a guardian force:\nl
A saviour gesture stretched her lifted arm,\nl
And symbol of some native cosmic strength,\nl
A sacred beast lay prone below her feet,\nl
Page 528

A silent flame-eyed mass of living force.\nl
All underwent a high celestial change:\nl
Breaking the black Inconscient's blind mute wall,\nl
Effacing the circles of the Ignorance,\nl
Powers and divinities burst flaming forth;\nl
Each part of the being trembling with delight\nl
Lay overwhelmed with tides of happiness\nl
And saw her hand in every circumstance\nl
And felt her touch in every limb and cell.\nl
In the country of the lotus of the head\nl
Which thinking mind has made its busy space,\nl
In the castle of the lotus twixt the brows\nl
Whence it shoots the arrows of its sight and will,\nl
In the passage of the lotus of the throat\nl
Where speech must rise and the expressing mind\nl
And the heart's impulse run towards word and act,\nl
A glad uplift and a new working came.\nl
The immortal's thoughts displaced our bounded view,\nl
The immortal's thoughts earth's drab idea and sense;\nl
All things now bore a deeper heavenlier sense.\nl
A glad clear harmony marked their truth's outline,\nl
Reset the balance and measures of the world.\nl
Each shape showed its occult design, unveiled\nl
God's meaning in it for which it was made\nl
And the vivid splendour of his artist thought.\nl
A channel of the mighty Mother's choice,\nl
The immortal's will took into its calm control\nl
Our blind or erring government of life;\nl
A loose republic once of wants and needs,\nl
Then bowed to the uncertain sovereign mind,\nl
Life now obeyed to a diviner rule\nl
And every act became an act of God.\nl
In the kingdom of the lotus of the heart\nl
Love chanting its pure hymeneal hymn\nl
Made life and body mirrors of sacred joy\nl
And all the emotions gave themselves to God.\nl
Page 529

In the navel lotus' broad imperial range\nl
Its proud ambitions and its master lusts\nl
Were tamed into instruments of a great calm sway\nl
To do a work of God on earthly soil.\nl
In the narrow nether centre's petty parts\nl
Its childish game of daily dwarf desires\nl
Was changed into a sweet and boisterous play,\nl
A romp of little gods with life in Time.\nl
In the deep place where once the Serpent slept,\nl
There came a grip on Matter's giant powers\nl
For large utilities in life's little space;\nl
A firm ground was made for Heaven's descending might.\nl
Behind all reigned her sovereign deathless soul:\nl
Casting aside its veil of Ignorance,\nl
Allied to gods and cosmic beings and powers\nl
It built the harmony of its human state;\nl
Surrendered into the great World-Mother's hands\nl
Only she obeyed her sole supreme behest\nl
In the enigma of the Inconscient's world.\nl
A secret soul behind supporting all\nl
Is master and witness of our ignorant life,\nl
Admits the Person's look and Nature's role.\nl
But once the hidden doors are flung apart\nl
Then the veiled king steps out in Nature's front;\nl
A Light comes down into the Ignorance,\nl
Its heavy painful knot loosens its grasp:\nl
The mind becomes a mastered instrument\nl
And life a hue and figure of the soul.\nl
All happily grows towards knowledge and towards bliss.\nl
A divine Puissance then takes Nature's place\nl
And pushes the movements of our body and mind;\nl
Possessor of our passionate hopes and dreams,\nl
The beloved despot of our thoughts and acts,\nl
She streams into us with her unbound force,\nl
Into mortal limbs the Immortal's rapture and power.\nl
An inner law of beauty shapes our lives;\nl
Page 530

Our words become the natural speech of Truth,\nl
Each thought is a ripple on a sea of Light.\nl
Then sin and virtue leave the cosmic lists;\nl
They struggle no more in our delivered hearts:\nl
Our acts chime with God's simple natural good\nl
Or serve the rule of a supernal Right.\nl
All moods unlovely, evil and untrue\nl
Forsake their stations in fierce disarray\nl
And hide their shame in the subconscient's dusk.\nl
Then lifts the mind a cry of victory:\nl
“O soul, my soul, we have created Heaven,\nl
Within we have found the kingdom here of God,\nl
His fortress built in a loud ignorant world.\nl
Our life is entrenched between two rivers of Light,\nl
We have turned space into a gulf of peace\nl
And made the body a Capitol of bliss.\nl
What more, what more, if more must still be done?”\nl
In the slow process of the evolving spirit,\nl
In the brief stade between a death and birth\nl
A first perfection's stage is reached at last;\nl
Out of the wood and stone of our nature's stuff\nl
A temple is shaped where the high gods could live.\nl
Even if the struggling world is left outside\nl
One man's perfection still can save the world.\nl
There is won a new proximity to the skies,\nl
A first betrothal of the Earth to Heaven,\nl
A deep concordat between Truth and Life:\nl
A camp of God is pitched in human time.\nl

\sbigcap A calm slow sun looked down from tranquil heavens.\nl
A routed sullen rearguard of retreat,\nl
The last rains had fled murmuring across the woods\nl
Or failed, a sibilant whisper mid the leaves,\nl
And the great blue enchantment of the sky\nl
Recovered the deep rapture of its smile.\nl
Its mellow splendour unstressed by storm-licked heats\nl
Found room for a luxury of warm mild days,\nl
The night's gold treasure of autumnal moons\nl
Came floating shipped through ripples of faery air.\nl
And Savitri's life was glad, fulfilled like earth's;\nl
She had found herself, she knew her being's aim.\nl
Although her kingdom of marvellous change within\nl
Remained unspoken in her secret breast,\nl
All that lived round her felt its magic's charm:\nl
The trees' rustling voices told it to the winds,\nl
Flowers spoke in ardent hues an unknown joy,\nl
The birds' carolling became a canticle,\nl
The beasts forgot their strife and lived at ease.\nl
Absorbed in wide communion with the Unseen\nl
The mild ascetics of the wood received\nl
A sudden greatening of their lonely muse.\nl
This bright perfection of her inner state\nl
Poured overflowing into her outward scene,\nl
Made beautiful dull common natural things\nl
And action wonderful and time divine.\nl
Even the smallest meanest work became\nl
A sweet or glad and glorious sacrament,\nl
An offering to the self of the great world\nl
Or a service to the One in each and all.\nl
Page 532

A light invaded all from her being's light;\nl
Her heart-beats' dance communicated bliss:\nl
Happiness grew happier, shared with her, by her touch\nl
And grief some solace found when she drew near.\nl
Above the cherished head of Satyavan\nl
She saw not now Fate's dark and lethal orb;\nl
A golden circle round a mystic sun\nl
Disclosed to her new-born predicting sight\nl
The cyclic rondure of a sovereign life.\nl
In her visions and deep-etched veridical dreams,\nl
In brief shiftings of the future's heavy screen,\nl
He lay not by a dolorous decree\nl
A victim in the dismal antre of death\nl
Or borne to blissful regions far from her\nl
Forgetting the sweetness of earth's warm delight,\nl
Forgetting the passionate oneness of love's clasp,\nl
Absolved in the self-rapt immortal's bliss.\nl
Always he was with her, a living soul\nl
That met her eyes with close enamoured eyes,\nl
A living body near to her body's joy.\nl
But now no longer in these great wild woods\nl
In kinship with the days of bird and beast\nl
And levelled to the bareness of earth's brown breast,\nl
But mid the thinking high-built lives of men\nl
In tapestried chambers and on crystal floors,\nl
In armoured town or gardened pleasure-walks,\nl
Even in distance closer than her thoughts,\nl
Body to body near, soul near to soul,\nl
Moving as if by a common breath and will\nl
They were tied in the single circling of their days\nl
Together by love's unseen atmosphere,\nl
Inseparable like the earth and sky.\nl
Thus for a while she trod the Golden Path;\nl
This was the sun before abysmal Night.\nl
\sparn Once as she sat in deep felicitous muse,\nl
Still quivering from her lover's strong embrace,\nl
Page 533

And made her joy a bridge twixt earth and heaven,\nl
An abyss yawned suddenly beneath her heart.\nl
A vast and nameless fear dragged at her nerves\nl
As drags a wild beast its half-slaughtered prey;\nl
It seemed to have no den from which it sprang:\nl
It was not hers, but hid its unseen cause.\nl
Then rushing came its vast and fearful Fount.\nl
A formless Dread with shapeless endless wings\nl
Filling the universe with its dangerous breath,\nl
A denser darkness than the Night could bear,\nl
Enveloped the heavens and possessed the earth.\nl
A rolling surge of silent death, it came\nl
Curving round the far edge of the quaking globe;\nl
Effacing heaven with its enormous stride\nl
It willed to expunge the choked and anguished air\nl
And end the fable of the joy of life.\nl
It seemed her very being to forbid,\nl
Abolishing all by which her nature lived,\nl
And laboured to blot out her body and soul,\nl
A clutch of some half-seen Invisible,\nl
An ocean of terror and of sovereign might,\nl
A person and a black infinity.\nl
It seemed to cry to her without thought or word\nl
The message of its dark eternity\nl
And the awful meaning of its silences:\nl
Out of some sullen monstrous vast arisen,\nl
Out of an abysmal deep of grief and fear\nl
Imagined by some blind regardless self,\nl
A consciousness of being without its joy,\nl
Empty of thought, incapable of bliss,\nl
That felt life blank and nowhere found a soul,\nl
A voice to the dumb anguish of the heart\nl
Conveyed a stark sense of unspoken words;\nl
In her own depths she heard the unuttered thought\nl
That made unreal the world and all life meant.\nl
“Who art thou who claimst thy crown of separate birth,\nl
Page 534

The illusion of thy soul's reality\nl
And personal godhead on an ignorant globe\nl
In the animal body of imperfect man?\nl
Hope not to be happy in a world of pain\nl
And dream not, listening to the unspoken Word\nl
And dazzled by the inexpressible Ray,\nl
Transcending the mute Superconscient's realm,\nl
To give a body to the Unknowable,\nl
Or for a sanction to thy heart's delight\nl
To burden with bliss the silent still Supreme\nl
Profaning its bare and formless sanctity,\nl
Or call into thy chamber the Divine\nl
And sit with God tasting a human joy.\nl
I have created all, all I devour;\nl
I am Death and the dark terrible Mother of life,\nl
I am Kali black and naked in the world,\nl
I am Maya and the universe is my cheat.\nl
I lay waste human happiness with my breath\nl
And slay the will to live, the joy to be\nl
That all may pass back into nothingness\nl
And only abide the eternal and absolute.\nl
For only the blank Eternal can be true.\nl
All else is shadow and flash in Mind's bright glass,\nl
Mind, hollow mirror in which Ignorance sees\nl
A splendid figure of its own false self\nl
And dreams it sees a glorious solid world.\nl
O soul, inventor of man's thoughts and hopes,\nl
Thyself the invention of the moments' stream,\nl
Illusion's centre or subtle apex point,\nl
At last know thyself, from vain existence cease.”\nl
A shadow of the negating Absolute,\nl
The intolerant Darkness travelled surging past\nl
And ebbed in her the formidable Voice.\nl
It left behind her inner world laid waste:\nl
A barren silence weighed upon her heart,\nl
Her kingdom of delight was there no more;\nl
Page 535

Only her soul remained, its emptied stage,\nl
Awaiting the unknown eternal Will.\nl
Then from the heights a greater Voice came down,\nl
The Word that touches the heart and finds the soul,\nl
The voice of Light after the voice of Night:\nl
The cry of the Abyss drew Heaven's reply,\nl
A might of storm chased by the might of the Sun.\nl
“O soul, bare not thy kingdom to the foe;\nl
Consent to hide thy royalty of bliss\nl
Lest Time and Fate find out its avenues\nl
And beat with thunderous knock upon thy gates.\nl
Hide whilst thou canst thy treasure of separate self\nl
Behind the luminous rampart of thy depths\nl
Till of a vaster empire it grows part.\nl
But not for self alone the Self is won:\nl
Content abide not with one conquered realm;\nl
Adventure all to make the whole world thine,\nl
To break into greater kingdoms turn thy force.\nl
Fear not to be nothing that thou mayst be all;\nl
Assent to the emptiness of the Supreme\nl
That all in thee may reach its absolute.\nl
Accept to be small and human on the earth,\nl
Interrupting thy new-born divinity,\nl
That man may find his utter self in God.\nl
If for thy own sake only thou hast come,\nl
An immortal spirit into the mortal's world,\nl
To found thy luminous kingdom in God's dark,\nl
In the Inconscient's realm one shining star,\nl
One door in the Ignorance opened upon light,\nl
Why hadst thou any need to come at all?\nl
Thou hast come down into a struggling world\nl
To aid a blind and suffering mortal race,\nl
To open to Light the eyes that could not see,\nl
To bring down bliss into the heart of grief,\nl
To make thy life a bridge twixt earth and heaven;\nl
If thou wouldst save the toiling universe,\nl
Page 536

The vast universal suffering feel as thine:\nl
Thou must bear the sorrow that thou claimst to heal;\nl
The day-bringer must walk in darkest night.\nl
He who would save the world must share its pain.\nl
If he knows not grief, how shall he find grief's cure?\nl
If far he walks above mortality's head,\nl
How shall the mortal reach that too high path?\nl
If one of theirs they see scale heaven's peaks,\nl
Men then can hope to learn that titan climb.\nl
God must be born on earth and be as man\nl
That man being human may grow even as God.\nl
He who would save the world must be one with the world,\nl
All suffering things contain in his heart's space\nl
And bear the grief and joy of all that lives.\nl
His soul must be wider than the universe\nl
And feel eternity as its very stuff,\nl
Rejecting the moment's personality\nl
Know itself older than the birth of Time,\nl
Creation an incident in its consciousness,\nl
Arcturus and Belphegor grains of fire\nl
Circling in a corner of its boundless self,\nl
The world's destruction a small transient storm\nl
In the calm infinity it has become.\nl
If thou wouldst a little loosen the vast chain,\nl
Draw back from the world that the Idea has made,\nl
Thy mind's selection from the Infinite,\nl
Thy senses' gloss on the Infinitesimal's dance,\nl
Then shalt thou know how the great bondage came.\nl
Banish all thought from thee and be God's void.\nl
Then shalt thou uncover the Unknowable\nl
And the Superconscient conscious grow on thy tops;\nl
Infinity's vision through thy gaze shall pierce;\nl
Thou shalt look into the eyes of the Unknown,\nl
Find the hid Truth in things seen null and false,\nl
Behind things known discover Mystery's rear.\nl
Thou shalt be one with God's bare reality\nl
Page 537

And the miraculous world he has become\nl
And the diviner miracle still to be\nl
When Nature who is now unconscious God\nl
Translucent grows to the Eternal's light,\nl
Her seeing his sight, her walk his steps of power\nl
And life is filled with a spiritual joy\nl
And Matter is the Spirit's willing bride.\nl
Consent to be nothing and none, dissolve Time's work,\nl
Cast off thy mind, step back from form and name.\nl
Annul thyself that only God may be.”\nl

\spar Thus spoke the mighty and uplifting Voice,\nl
And Savitri heard; she bowed her head and mused\nl
Plunging her deep regard into herself\nl
In her soul's privacy in the silent Night.\nl
Aloof and standing back detached and calm,\nl
A witness of the drama of herself,\nl
A student of her own interior scene,\nl
She watched the passion and the toil of life\nl
And heard in the crowded thoroughfares of mind\nl
The unceasing tread and passage of her thoughts.\nl
All she allowed to rise that chose to stir;\nl
Calling, compelling nought, forbidding nought,\nl
She left all to the process formed in Time\nl
And the free initiative of Nature's will.\nl
Thus following the complex human play\nl
She heard the prompter's voice behind the scenes,\nl
Perceived the original libretto's set\nl
And the organ theme of the composer Force.\nl
All she beheld that surges from man's depths,\nl
The animal instincts prowling mid life's trees,\nl
The impulses that whisper to the heart\nl
And passion's thunder-chase sweeping the nerves;\nl
She saw the Powers that stare from the Abyss\nl
And the wordless Light that liberates the soul.\nl
But most her gaze pursued the birth of thought.\nl
Page 538

Affranchised from the look of surface mind\nl
She paused not to survey the official case,\nl
The issue of forms from the office of the brain,\nl
Its factory of thought-sounds and soundless words\nl
And voices stored within unheard by men,\nl
Its mint and treasury of shining coin.\nl
These were but counters in mind's symbol game,\nl
A gramophone's discs, a reproduction's film,\nl
A list of signs, a cipher and a code.\nl
In our unseen subtle body thought is born\nl
Or there it enters from the cosmic field.\nl
Oft from her soul stepped out a naked thought\nl
Luminous with mysteried lips and wonderful eyes;\nl
Or from her heart emerged some burning face\nl
And looked for life and love and passionate truth,\nl
Aspired to heaven or embraced the world\nl
Or led the fancy like a fleeting moon\nl
Across the dull sky of man's common days,\nl
Amidst the doubtful certitudes of earth's lore,\nl
To the celestial beauty of faith gave form,\nl
As if at flower-prints in a dingy room\nl
Laughed in a golden vase one living rose.\nl
A thaumaturgist sat in her heart's deep,\nl
Compelled the forward stride, the upward look,\nl
Till wonder leaped into the illumined breast\nl
And life grew marvellous with transfiguring hope.\nl
A seeing will pondered between the brows;\nl
Thoughts, glistening Angels, stood behind the brain\nl
In flashing armour, folding hands of prayer,\nl
And poured heaven's rays into the earthly form.\nl
Imaginations flamed up from her breast,\nl
Unearthly beauty, touches of surpassing joy\nl
And plans of miracle, dreams of delight:\nl
Around her navel lotus clustering close\nl
Her large sensations of the teeming worlds\nl
Streamed their dumb movements of the unformed Idea;\nl
Page 539

Invading the small sensitive flower of the throat\nl
They brought their mute unuttered resonances\nl
To kindle the figures of a heavenly speech.\nl
Below, desires formed their wordless wish,\nl
And longings of physical sweetness and ecstasy\nl
Translated into the accents of a cry\nl
Their grasp on objects and their clasp on souls.\nl
Her body's thoughts climbed from her conscious limbs\nl
And carried their yearnings to its mystic crown\nl
Where Nature's murmurs meet the Ineffable.\nl
But for the mortal prisoned in outward mind\nl
All must present their passports at its door;\nl
Disguised they must don the official cap and mask\nl
Or pass as manufactures of the brain,\nl
Unknown their secret truth and hidden source.\nl
Only to the inner mind they speak direct,\nl
Put on a body and assume a voice,\nl
Their passage seen, their message heard and known,\nl
Their birthplace and their natal mark revealed,\nl
And stand confessed to an immortal's sight,\nl
Our nature's messengers to the witness soul.\nl
Impenetrable, withheld from mortal sense,\nl
The inner chambers of the spirit's house\nl
Disclosed to her their happenings and their guests;\nl
Eyes looked through crevices in the invisible wall\nl
And through the secrecy of unseen doors\nl
There came into mind's little frontal room\nl
Thoughts that enlarged our limited human range,\nl
Lifted the ideal's half-quenched or sinking torch\nl
Or peered through the finite at the infinite.\nl
A sight opened upon the invisible\nl
And sensed the shapes that mortal eyes see not,\nl
The sounds that mortal listening cannot hear,\nl
The blissful sweetness of the intangible's touch;\nl
The objects that to us are empty air,\nl
Are there the stuff of daily experience\nl
Page 540

And the common pabulum of sense and thought.\nl
The beings of the subtle realms appeared\nl
And scenes concealed behind our earthly scene;\nl
She saw the life of remote continents\nl
And distance deafened not to voices far;\nl
She felt the movements crossing unknown minds;\nl
The past's events occurred before her eyes.\nl
The great world's thoughts were part of her own thought,\nl
The feelings dumb for ever and unshared,\nl
The ideas that never found an utterance.\nl
The dim subconscient's incoherent hints\nl
Laid bare a meaning twisted, deep and strange,\nl
The bizarre secret of their fumbling speech,\nl
Their links with underlying reality.\nl
The unseen grew visible and audible:\nl
Thoughts leaped down from a superconscient field\nl
Like eagles swooping from a viewless peak,\nl
Thoughts gleamed up from the screened subliminal depths\nl
Like golden fishes from a hidden sea.\nl
This world is a vast unbroken totality,\nl
A deep solidarity joins its contrary powers;\nl
God's summits look back on the mute Abyss.\nl
So man evolving to divinest heights\nl
Colloques still with the animal and the Djinn;\nl
The human godhead with star-gazer eyes\nl
Lives still in one house with the primal beast.\nl
The high meets the low, all is a single plan.\nl
So she beheld the many births of thought,\nl
If births can be of what eternal is;\nl
For the Eternal's powers are like himself,\nl
Timeless in the Timeless, in Time ever born.\nl
This too she saw that all in outer mind\nl
Is made, not born, a product perishable,\nl
Forged in the body's factory by earth-force.\nl
This mind is a dynamic small machine\nl
Producing ceaselessly, till it wears out,\nl
Page 541

With raw material drawn from the outside world,\nl
The patterns sketched out by an artist God.\nl
Often our thoughts are finished cosmic wares\nl
Admitted by a silent office gate\nl
And passed through the subconscient's galleries,\nl
Then issued in Time's mart as private make.\nl
For now they bear the living person's stamp;\nl
A trick, a special hue claims them his own.\nl
All else is Nature's craft and this too hers.\nl
Our tasks are given, we are but instruments;\nl
Nothing is all our own that we create:\nl
The Power that acts in us is not our force.\nl
The genius too receives from some high fount\nl
Concealed in a supernal secrecy\nl
The work that gives him an immortal name.\nl
The word, the form, the charm, the glory and grace\nl
Are missioned sparks from a stupendous Fire;\nl
A sample from the laboratory of God\nl
Of which he holds the patent upon earth,\nl
Comes to him wrapped in golden coverings;\nl
He listens for Inspiration's postman knock\nl
And takes delivery of the priceless gift\nl
A little spoilt by the receiver mind\nl
Or mixed with the manufacture of his brain;\nl
When least defaced, then is it most divine.\nl
Although his ego claims the world for its use,\nl
Man is a dynamo for the cosmic work;\nl
Nature does most in him, God the high rest:\nl
Only his soul's acceptance is his own.\nl
This independent, once a power supreme,\nl
Self-born before the universe was made,\nl
Accepting cosmos, binds himself Nature's serf\nl
Till he becomes her freedman—or God's slave.\nl
This is the appearance in our mortal front;\nl
Our greater truth of being lies behind:\nl
Our consciousness is cosmic and immense,\nl
Page 542

But only when we break through Matter's wall\nl
In that spiritual vastness can we stand\nl
Where we can live the masters of our world\nl
And mind is only a means and body a tool.\nl
For above the birth of body and of thought\nl
Our spirit's truth lives in the naked self\nl
And from that height, unbound, surveys the world.\nl
Out of the mind she rose to escape its law\nl
That it might sleep in some deep shadow of self\nl
Or fall silent in the silence of the Unseen.\nl
High she attained and stood from Nature free\nl
And saw creation's life from far above,\nl
Thence upon all she laid her sovereign will\nl
To dedicate it to God's timeless calm:\nl
Then all grew tranquil in her being's space,\nl
Only sometimes small thoughts arose and fell\nl
Like quiet waves upon a silent sea\nl
Or ripples passing over a lonely pool\nl
When a stray stone disturbs its dreaming rest.\nl
Yet the mind's factory had ceased to work,\nl
There was no sound of the dynamo's throb,\nl
There came no call from the still fields of life.\nl
Then even those stirrings rose in her no more;\nl
Her mind now seemed like a vast empty room\nl
Or like a peaceful landscape without sound.\nl
This men call quietude and prize as peace.\nl
But to her deeper sight all yet was there,\nl
Effervescing like a chaos under a lid;\nl
Feelings and thoughts cried out for word and act\nl
But found no response in the silenced brain:\nl
All was suppressed but nothing yet expunged;\nl
At every moment might explosion come.\nl
Then this too paused; the body seemed a stone.\nl
All now was a wide mighty vacancy,\nl
But still excluded from eternity's hush;\nl
For still was far the repose of the Absolute\nl
Page 543

And the ocean silence of Infinity.\nl
Even now some thoughts could cross her solitude;\nl
These surged not from the depths or from within\nl
Cast up from formlessness to seek a form,\nl
Spoke not the body's need nor voiced life's call.\nl
These seemed not born nor made in human Time:\nl
Children of cosmic Nature from a far world,\nl
Idea's shapes in complete armour of words\nl
Posted like travellers in an alien space.\nl
Out of some far expanse they seemed to come\nl
As if carried on vast wings like large white sails,\nl
And with easy access reached the inner ear\nl
As though they used a natural privileged right\nl
To the high royal entries of the soul.\nl
As yet their path lay deep-concealed in light.\nl
Then looking to know whence the intruders came\nl
She saw a spiritual immensity\nl
Pervading and encompassing the world-space\nl
As ether our transparent tangible air,\nl
And through it sailing tranquilly a thought.\nl
As smoothly glides a ship nearing its port,\nl
Ignorant of embargo and blockade,\nl
Confident of entrance and the visa's seal,\nl
It came to the silent city of the brain\nl
Towards its accustomed and expectant quay,\nl
But met a barring will, a blow of Force\nl
And sank vanishing in the immensity.\nl
After a long vacant pause another appeared\nl
And others one by one suddenly emerged,\nl
Mind's unexpected visitors from the Unseen\nl
Like far-off sails upon a lonely sea.\nl
But soon that commerce failed, none reached mind's coast.\nl
Then all grew still, nothing moved any more:\nl
Immobile, self-rapt, timeless, solitary\nl
A silent spirit pervaded silent Space.\nl
Page 544

\spar In that absolute stillness bare and formidable\nl
There was glimpsed an all-negating Void Supreme\nl
That claimed its mystic Nihil's sovereign right\nl
To cancel Nature and deny the soul.\nl
Even the nude sense of self grew pale and thin:\nl
Impersonal, signless, featureless, void of forms\nl
A blank pure consciousness had replaced the mind.\nl
Her spirit seemed the substance of a name,\nl
The world a pictured symbol drawn on self,\nl
A dream of images, a dream of sounds\nl
Built up the semblance of a universe\nl
Or lent to spirit the appearance of a world.\nl
This was self-seeing; in that intolerant hush\nl
No notion and no concept could take shape,\nl
There was no sense to frame the figure of things,\nl
A sheer self-sight was there, no thought arose.\nl
Emotion slept deep down in the still heart\nl
Or lay buried in a cemetery of peace:\nl
All feelings seemed quiescent, calm or dead,\nl
As if the heart-strings rent could work no more\nl
And joy and grief could never rise again.\nl
The heart beat on with an unconscious rhythm\nl
But no response came from it and no cry.\nl
Vain was the provocation of events;\nl
Nothing within answered an outside touch,\nl
No nerve was stirred and no reaction rose.\nl
Yet still her body saw and moved and spoke;\nl
It understood without the aid of thought,\nl
It said whatever needed to be said,\nl
It did whatever needed to be done.\nl
There was no person there behind the act,\nl
No mind that chose or passed the fitting word:\nl
All wrought like an unerring apt machine.\nl
As if continuing old habitual turns,\nl
And pushed by an old unexhausted force\nl
The engine did the work for which it was made:\nl
Page 545

Her consciousness looked on and took no part;\nl
All it upheld, in nothing had a share.\nl
There was no strong initiator will;\nl
An incoherence crossing a firm void\nl
Slipped into an order of related chance.\nl
A pure perception was the only power\nl
That stood behind her action and her sight.\nl
If that retired, all objects would be extinct,\nl
Her private universe would cease to be,\nl
The house she had built with bricks of thought and sense\nl
In the beginning after the birth of Space.\nl
This seeing was identical with the seen;\nl
It knew without knowledge all that could be known,\nl
It saw impartially the world go by,\nl
But in the same supine unmoving glance\nl
Saw too its abysmal unreality.\nl
It watched the figure of the cosmic game,\nl
But the thought and inner life in forms seemed dead,\nl
Abolished by her own collapse of thought:\nl
A hollow physical shell persisted still.\nl
All seemed a brilliant shadow of itself,\nl
A cosmic film of scenes and images:\nl
The enduring mass and outline of the hills\nl
Was a design sketched on a silent mind\nl
And held to a tremulous false solidity\nl
By constant beats of visionary sight.\nl
The forest with its emerald multitudes\nl
Clothed with its show of hues vague empty Space,\nl
A painting's colours hiding a surface void\nl
That flickered upon dissolution's edge;\nl
The blue heavens, an illusion of the eyes,\nl
Roofed in the mind's illusion of a world.\nl
The men who walked beneath an unreal sky\nl
Seemed mobile puppets out of cardboard cut\nl
And pushed by unseen hands across the soil\nl
Or moving pictures upon Fancy's film:\nl
Page 546

There was no soul within, no power of life.\nl
The brain's vibrations that appear like thought,\nl
The nerve's brief answer to each contact's knock,\nl
The heart's quiverings felt as joy and grief and love\nl
Were twitchings of the body, their seeming self,\nl
That body forged from atoms and from gas\nl
A manufactured lie of Maya's make,\nl
Its life a dream seen by the sleeping Void.\nl
The animals lone or trooping through the glades\nl
Fled like a passing vision of beauty and grace\nl
Imagined by some all-creating Eye.\nl
Yet something was there behind the fading scene;\nl
Wherever she turned, at whatsoever she looked,\nl
It was perceived, yet hid from mind and sight.\nl
The One only real shut itself from Space\nl
And stood aloof from the idea of Time.\nl
Its truth escaped from shape and line and hue.\nl
All else grew unsubstantial, self-annulled,\nl
This only everlasting seemed and true,\nl
Yet nowhere dwelt, it was outside the hours.\nl
This only could justify the labour of sight,\nl
But sight could not define for it a form;\nl
This only could appease the unsatisfied ear\nl
But hearing listened in vain for a missing sound;\nl
This answered not the sense, called not to Mind.\nl
It met her as the uncaught inaudible Voice\nl
That speaks for ever from the Unknowable.\nl
It met her like an omnipresent point\nl
Pure of dimensions, unfixed, invisible,\nl
The single oneness of its multiplied beat\nl
Accentuating its sole eternity.\nl
It faced her as some vast Nought's immensity,\nl
An endless No to all that seems to be,\nl
An endless Yes to things ever unconceived\nl
And all that is unimagined and unthought,\nl
An eternal zero or untotalled Aught,\nl
Page 547

A spaceless and a placeless Infinite.\nl
Yet eternity and infinity seemed but words\nl
Vainly affixed by mind's incompetence\nl
To its stupendous lone reality.\nl
The world is but a spark-burst from its light,\nl
All moments flashes from its Timelessness,\nl
All objects glimmerings of the Bodiless\nl
That disappear from Mind when That is seen.\nl
It held, as if a shield before its face,\nl
A consciousness that saw without a seer,\nl
The Truth where knowledge is not nor knower nor known,\nl
The Love enamoured of its own delight\nl
In which the Lover is not nor the Beloved\nl
Bringing their personal passion into the Vast,\nl
The Force omnipotent in quietude,\nl
The Bliss that none can ever hope to taste.\nl
It cancelled the convincing cheat of self;\nl
A truth in nothingness was its mighty clue.\nl
If all existence could renounce to be\nl
And Being take refuge in Non-being's arms\nl
And Non-being could strike out its ciphered round,\nl
Some lustre of that Reality might appear.\nl
A formless liberation came on her.\nl
Once sepulchred alive in brain and flesh\nl
She had risen up from body, mind and life;\nl
She was no more a Person in a world,\nl
She had escaped into infinity.\nl
What once had been herself had disappeared;\nl
There was no frame of things, no figure of soul.\nl
A refugee from the domain of sense,\nl
Evading the necessity of thought,\nl
Delivered from Knowledge and from Ignorance\nl
And rescued from the true and the untrue,\nl
She shared the Superconscient's high retreat\nl
Beyond the self-born Word, the nude Idea,\nl
The first bare solid ground of consciousness;\nl
Page 548

Beings were not there, existence had no place,\nl
There was no temptation of the joy to be.\nl
Unutterably effaced, no one and null,\nl
A vanishing vestige like a violet trace,\nl
A faint record merely of a self now past,\nl
She was a point in the unknowable.\nl
Only some last annulment now remained,\nl
Annihilation's vague indefinable step:\nl
A memory of being still was there\nl
And kept her separate from nothingness:\nl
She was in That but still became not That.\nl
This shadow of herself so close to nought\nl
Could be again self's point d'appui to live,\nl
Return out of the Inconceivable\nl
And be what some mysterious vast might choose.\nl
Even as the Unknowable decreed,\nl
She might be nought or new-become the All,\nl
Or if the omnipotent Nihil took a shape\nl
Emerge as someone and redeem the world.\nl
Even, she might learn what the mystic cipher held,\nl
This seeming exit or closed end of all\nl
Could be a blind tenebrous passage screened from sight,\nl
Her state the eclipsing shell of a darkened sun\nl
On its secret way to the Ineffable.\nl
Even now her splendid being might flame back\nl
Out of the silence and the nullity,\nl
A gleaming portion of the All-Wonderful,\nl
A power of some all-affirming Absolute,\nl
A shining mirror of the eternal Truth\nl
To show to the One-in-all its manifest face,\nl
To the souls of men their deep identity.\nl
Or she might wake into God's quietude\nl
Beyond the cosmic day and cosmic night\nl
And rest appeased in his white eternity.\nl
But this was now unreal or remote\nl
Or covered in the mystic fathomless blank.\nl
Page 549

In infinite Nothingness was the ultimate sign\nl
Or else the Real was the Unknowable.\nl
A lonely Absolute negated all:\nl
It effaced the ignorant world from its solitude\nl
And drowned the soul in its everlasting peace.\nl

\par
\sbigcap In the little hermitage in the forest's heart,\nl
In the sunlight and the moonlight and the dark\nl
The daily human life went plodding on\nl
Even as before with its small unchanging works\nl
And its spare outward body of routine\nl
And happy quiet of ascetic peace.\nl
The old beauty smiled of the terrestrial scene;\nl
She too was her old gracious self to men.\nl
The Ancient Mother clutched her child to her breast\nl
Pressing her close in her environing arms,\nl
As if earth ever the same could for ever keep\nl
The living spirit and body in her clasp,\nl
As if death were not there nor end nor change.\nl
Accustomed only to read outward signs\nl
None saw aught new in her, none divined her state;\nl
They saw a person where was only God's vast,\nl
A still being or a mighty nothingness.\nl
To all she was the same perfect Savitri:\nl
A greatness and a sweetness and a light\nl
Poured out from her upon her little world.\nl
Life showed to all the same familiar face,\nl
Her acts followed the old unaltered round,\nl
She spoke the words that she was wont to speak\nl
And did the things that she had always done.\nl
Her eyes looked out on earth's unchanging face,\nl
Around her soul's muteness all moved as of old;\nl
A vacant consciousness watched from within,\nl
Empty of all but bare Reality.\nl
There was no will behind the word and act,\nl
No thought formed in her brain to guide the speech:\nl
Page 551

An impersonal emptiness walked and spoke in her,\nl
Something perhaps unfelt, unseen, unknown\nl
Guarded the body for its future work,\nl
Or Nature moved in her old stream of force.\nl
Perhaps she bore made conscious in her breast\nl
The miraculous Nihil, origin of our souls\nl
And source and sum of the vast world's events,\nl
The womb and grave of thought, a cipher of God,\nl
A zero circle of being's totality.\nl
It used her speech and acted in her acts,\nl
It was beauty in her limbs, life in her breath;\nl
The original Mystery wore her human face.\nl
Thus was she lost within to separate self;\nl
Her mortal ego perished in God's night.\nl
Only a body was left, the ego's shell\nl
Afloat mid drift and foam of the world-sea,\nl
A sea of dream watched by a motionless sense\nl
In a figure of unreal reality.\nl
An impersonal foresight could already see,—\nl
In the unthinking knowledge of the spirit\nl
Even now it seemed nigh done, inevitable,—\nl
The individual die, the cosmos pass;\nl
These gone, the transcendental grew a myth,\nl
The Holy Ghost without the Father and Son,\nl
Or, a substratum of what once had been,\nl
Being that never willed to bear a world\nl
Restored to its original loneliness,\nl
Impassive, sole, silent, intangible.\nl
Yet all was not extinct in this deep loss;\nl
The being travelled not towards nothingness.\nl
There was some high surpassing Secrecy,\nl
And when she sat alone with Satyavan,\nl
Her moveless mind with his that searched and strove,\nl
In the hush of the profound and intimate night\nl
She turned to the face of a veiled voiceless Truth\nl
Hid in the dumb recesses of the heart\nl
Page 552

Or waiting beyond the last peak climbed by Thought,—\nl
Unseen itself it sees the struggling world\nl
And prompts our quest, but cares not to be found,—\nl
Out of that distant Vast came a reply.\nl
Something unknown, unreached, inscrutable\nl
Sent down the messages of its bodiless Light,\nl
Cast lightning flashes of a thought not ours\nl
Crossing the immobile silence of her mind:\nl
In its might of irresponsible sovereignty\nl
It seized on speech to give those flamings shape,\nl
Made beat the heart of wisdom in a word\nl
And spoke immortal things through mortal lips.\nl
Or, listening to the sages of the woods,\nl
In question and in answer broke from her\nl
High strange revealings impossible to men,\nl
Something or someone secret and remote\nl
Took hold of her body for his mystic use,\nl
Her mouth was seized to channel ineffable truths,\nl
Knowledge unthinkable found an utterance.\nl
Astonished by a new enlightenment,\nl
Invaded by a streak of the Absolute,\nl
They marvelled at her, for she seemed to know\nl
What they had only glimpsed at times afar.\nl
These thoughts were formed not in her listening brain,\nl
Her vacant heart was like a stringless harp;\nl
Impassive the body claimed not its own voice,\nl
But let the luminous greatness through it pass.\nl
A dual Power at being's occult poles\nl
Still acted, nameless and invisible:\nl
Her divine emptiness was their instrument.\nl
Inconscient Nature dealt with the world it had made,\nl
And using still the body's instruments\nl
Slipped through the conscious void she had become;\nl
The superconscient Mystery through that Void\nl
Missioned its word to touch the thoughts of men.\nl
As yet this great impersonal speech was rare.\nl
Page 553

But now the unmoving wide spiritual space\nl
In which her mind survived tranquil and bare,\nl
Admitted a traveller from the cosmic breadths:\nl
A thought came through draped as an outer voice.\nl
It called not for the witness of the mind,\nl
It spoke not to the hushed receiving heart;\nl
It came direct to the pure perception's seat,\nl
An only centre now of consciousness,\nl
If centre could be where all seemed only space;\nl
No more shut in by body's walls and gates\nl
Her being, a circle without circumference,\nl
Already now surpassed all cosmic bounds\nl
And more and more spread into infinity.\nl
This being was its own unbounded world,\nl
A world without form or feature or circumstance;\nl
It had no ground, no wall, no roof of thought,\nl
Yet saw itself and looked on all around\nl
In a silence motionless and illimitable.\nl
There was no person there, no centred mind,\nl
No seat of feeling on which beat events\nl
Or objects wrought and shaped reaction's stress.\nl
There was no motion in this inner world,\nl
All was a still and even infinity.\nl
In her the Unseen, the Unknown waited his hour.\nl

\spar But now she sat by sleeping Satyavan,\nl
Awake within, and the enormous Night\nl
Surrounded her with the Unknowable's vast.\nl
A voice began to speak from her own heart\nl
That was not hers, yet mastered thought and sense.\nl
As it spoke all changed within her and without;\nl
All was, all lived; she felt all being one;\nl
The world of unreality ceased to be:\nl
There was no more a universe built by mind,\nl
Convicted as a structure or a sign;\nl
A spirit, a being saw created things\nl
Page 554

And cast itself into unnumbered forms\nl
And was what it saw and made; all now became\nl
An evidence of one stupendous truth,\nl
A Truth in which negation had no place,\nl
A being and a living consciousness,\nl
A stark and absolute Reality.\nl
There the unreal could not find a place,\nl
The sense of unreality was slain:\nl
There all was conscious, made of the Infinite,\nl
All had a substance of Eternity.\nl
Yet this was the same Indecipherable;\nl
It seemed to cast from it universe like a dream\nl
Vanishing for ever into an original Void.\nl
But this was no more some vague ubiquitous point\nl
Or a cipher of vastness in unreal Nought.\nl
It was the same but now no more seemed far\nl
To the living clasp of her recovered soul.\nl
It was her self, it was the self of all,\nl
It was the reality of existing things,\nl
It was the consciousness of all that lived\nl
And felt and saw; it was Timelessness and Time,\nl
It was the Bliss of formlessness and form.\nl
It was all Love and the one Beloved's arms,\nl
It was sight and thought in one all-seeing Mind,\nl
It was joy of Being on the peaks of God.\nl
She passed beyond Time into eternity,\nl
Slipped out of space and became the Infinite;\nl
Her being rose into unreachable heights\nl
And found no end of its journey in the Self.\nl
It plunged into the unfathomable deeps\nl
And found no end to the silent mystery\nl
That held all world within one lonely breast,\nl
Yet harboured all creation's multitudes.\nl
She was all vastness and one measureless point,\nl
She was a height beyond heights, a depth beyond depths,\nl
She lived in the everlasting and was all\nl
Page 555

That harbours death and bears the wheeling hours.\nl
All contraries were true in one huge spirit\nl
Surpassing measure, change and circumstance.\nl
An individual, one with cosmic self\nl
In the heart of the Transcendent's miracle\nl
And the secret of World-personality\nl
Was the creator and the lord of all.\nl
Mind was a single innumerable look\nl
Upon himself and all that he became.\nl
Life was his drama and the Vast a stage,\nl
The universe was his body, God its soul.\nl
All was one single immense reality,\nl
All its innumerable phenomenon.\nl
\sparn Her spirit saw the world as living God;\nl
It saw the One and knew that all was He.\nl
She knew him as the Absolute's self-space,\nl
One with her self and ground of all things here\nl
In which the world wanders seeking for the Truth\nl
Guarded behind its face of ignorance:\nl
She followed him through the march of endless Time.\nl
All Nature's happenings were events in her,\nl
The heart-beats of the cosmos were her own,\nl
All beings thought and felt and moved in her;\nl
She inhabited the vastness of the world,\nl
Its distances were her nature's boundaries,\nl
Its closenesses her own life's intimacies.\nl
Her mind became familiar with its mind,\nl
Its body was her body's larger frame\nl
In which she lived and knew herself in it\nl
One, multitudinous in its multitudes.\nl
She was a single being, yet all things;\nl
The world was her spirit's wide circumference,\nl
The thoughts of others were her intimates,\nl
Their feelings close to her universal heart,\nl
Their bodies her many bodies kin to her;\nl
She was no more herself but all the world.\nl
Page 556

Out of the infinitudes all came to her,\nl
Into the infinitudes sentient she spread,\nl
Infinity was her own natural home.\nl
Nowhere she dwelt, her spirit was everywhere,\nl
The distant constellations wheeled round her;\nl
Earth saw her born, all worlds were her colonies,\nl
The greater worlds of life and mind were hers;\nl
All Nature reproduced her in its lines,\nl
Its movements were large copies of her own.\nl
She was the single self of all these selves,\nl
She was in them and they were all in her.\nl
This first was an immense identity\nl
In which her own identity was lost:\nl
What seemed herself was an image of the Whole.\nl
She was a subconscient life of tree and flower,\nl
The outbreak of the honied buds of spring;\nl
She burned in the passion and splendour of the rose,\nl
She was the red heart of the passion-flower,\nl
The dream-white of the lotus in its pool.\nl
Out of subconscient life she climbed to mind,\nl
She was thought and the passion of the world's heart,\nl
She was the godhead hid in the heart of man,\nl
She was the climbing of his soul to God.\nl
The cosmos flowered in her, she was its bed.\nl
She was Time and the dreams of God in Time;\nl
She was Space and the wideness of his days.\nl
From this she rose where Time and Space were not;\nl
The superconscient was her native air,\nl
Infinity was her movement's natural space;\nl
Eternity looked out from her on Time.\nl

\ht Canto Three: Death in the Forest
\note{The Book of Death was taken from Canto Three of an early version of {\it Savitri} which had only six cantos and an epilogue. It was slightly revised at a late stage and a number of new lines were added, but it was never fully worked into the final version of the poem. Its original designation, “Canto Three”, has been retained as a reminder of this.}\nl
\par
\sbigcap Now it was here in this great golden dawn.\nl
By her still sleeping husband lain she gazed\nl
Into her past as one about to die\nl
Looks back upon the sunlit fields of life\nl
Where he too ran and sported with the rest,\nl
Lifting his head above the huge dark stream\nl
Into whose depths he must for ever plunge.\nl
All she had been and done she lived again.\nl
The whole year in a swift and eddying race\nl
Of memories swept through her and fled away\nl
Into the irrecoverable past.\nl
Then silently she rose and, service done,\nl
Bowed down to the great goddess simply carved\nl
By Satyavan upon a forest stone.\nl
What prayer she breathed her soul and Durga knew.\nl
Perhaps she felt in the dim forest huge\nl
The infinite Mother watching over her child,\nl
Perhaps the shrouded Voice spoke some still word.\nl
At last she came to the pale mother queen.\nl
She spoke but with guarded lips and tranquil face\nl
Lest some stray word or some betraying look\nl
Should let pass into the mother's unknowing breast,\nl
Slaying all happiness and need to live,\nl
A dire foreknowledge of the grief to come.\nl
Only the needed utterance passage found:\nl
All else she pressed back into her anguished heart\nl
And forced upon her speech an outward peace.\nl
Page 561

“One year that I have lived with Satyavan\nl
Here on the emerald edge of the vast woods\nl
In the iron ring of the enormous peaks\nl
Under the blue rifts of the forest sky,\nl
I have not gone into the silences\nl
Of this great woodland that enringed my thoughts\nl
With mystery, nor in its green miracles\nl
Wandered, but this small clearing was my world.\nl
Now has a strong desire seized all my heart\nl
To go with Satyavan holding his hand\nl
Into the life that he has loved and touch\nl
Herbs he has trod and know the forest flowers\nl
And hear at ease the birds and the scurrying life\nl
That starts and ceases, rich far rustle of boughs\nl
And all the mystic whispering of the woods.\nl
Release me now and let my heart have rest.”\nl
She answered: “Do as thy wise mind desires,\nl
O calm child-sovereign with the eyes that rule.\nl
I hold thee for a strong goddess who has come\nl
Pitying our barren days; so dost thou serve\nl
Even as a slave might, yet art thou beyond\nl
All that thou doest, all our minds conceive,\nl
Like the strong sun that serves earth from above.”\nl
Then the doomed husband and the woman who knew\nl
Went with linked hands into that solemn world\nl
Where beauty and grandeur and unspoken dream,\nl
Where Nature's mystic silence could be felt\nl
Communing with the secrecy of God.\nl
Beside her Satyavan walked full of joy\nl
Because she moved with him through his green haunts:\nl
He showed her all the forest's riches, flowers\nl
Innumerable of every odour and hue\nl
And soft thick clinging creepers red and green\nl
And strange rich-plumaged birds, to every cry\nl
That haunted sweetly distant boughs replied\nl
With the shrill singer's name more sweetly called.\nl
Page 562

He spoke of all the things he loved: they were\nl
His boyhood's comrades and his playfellows,\nl
Coevals and companions of his life\nl
Here in this world whose every mood he knew:\nl
Their thoughts which to the common mind are blank,\nl
He shared, to every wild emotion felt\nl
An answer. Deeply she listened, but to hear\nl
The voice that soon would cease from tender words\nl
And treasure its sweet cadences beloved\nl
For lonely memory when none by her walked\nl
And the beloved voice could speak no more.\nl
But little dwelt her mind upon their sense;\nl
Of death, not life she thought or life's lone end.\nl
Love in her bosom hurt with the jagged edges\nl
Of anguish moaned at every step with pain\nl
Crying, “Now, now perhaps his voice will cease\nl
For ever.” Even by some vague touch oppressed\nl
Sometimes her eyes looked round as if their orbs\nl
Might see the dim and dreadful god's approach.\nl
But Satyavan had paused. He meant to finish\nl
His labour here that happy, linked, uncaring\nl
They two might wander free in the green deep\nl
Primaeval mystery of the forest's heart.\nl
A tree that raised its tranquil head to heaven\nl
Luxuriating in verdure, summoning\nl
The breeze with amorous wideness of its boughs,\nl
He chose and with his steel assailed the arm\nl
Brown, rough and strong hidden in its emerald dress.\nl
Wordless but near she watched, no turn to lose\nl
Of the bright face and body which she loved.\nl
Her life was now in seconds, not in hours,\nl
And every moment she economised\nl
Like a pale merchant leaned above his store,\nl
The miser of his poor remaining gold.\nl
But Satyavan wielded a joyous axe.\nl
He sang high snatches of a sage's chant\nl
Page 563

That pealed of conquered death and demons slain,\nl
And sometimes paused to cry to her sweet speech\nl
Of love and mockery tenderer than love:\nl
She like a pantheress leaped upon his words\nl
And carried them into her cavern heart.\nl
But as he worked, his doom upon him came.\nl
The violent and hungry hounds of pain\nl
Travelled through his body biting as they passed\nl
Silently, and all his suffering breath besieged\nl
Strove to rend life's strong heart-cords and be free.\nl
Then helped, as if a beast had left its prey,\nl
A moment in a wave of rich relief\nl
Reborn to strength and happy ease he stood\nl
Rejoicing and resumed his confident toil\nl
But with less seeing strokes. Now the great woodsman\nl
Hewed at him and his labour ceased: lifting\nl
His arm he flung away the poignant axe\nl
Far from him like an instrument of pain.\nl
She came to him in silent anguish and clasped,\nl
And he cried to her, “Savitri, a pang\nl
Cleaves through my head and breast as if the axe\nl
Were piercing it and not the living branch.\nl
Such agony rends me as the tree must feel\nl
When it is sundered and must lose its life.\nl
Awhile let me lay my head upon thy lap\nl
And guard me with thy hands from evil fate:\nl
Perhaps because thou touchest, death may pass.”\nl
Then Savitri sat under branches wide,\nl
Cool, green against the sun, not the hurt tree\nl
Which his keen axe had cloven,—that she shunned;\nl
But leaned beneath a fortunate kingly trunk\nl
She guarded him in her bosom and strove to soothe\nl
His anguished brow and body with her hands.\nl
All grief and fear were dead within her now\nl
And a great calm had fallen. The wish to lessen\nl
His suffering, the impulse that opposes pain\nl
Page 564

Were the one mortal feeling left. It passed:\nl
Griefless and strong she waited like the gods.\nl
But now his sweet familiar hue was changed\nl
Into a tarnished greyness and his eyes\nl
Dimmed over, forsaken of the clear light she loved.\nl
Only the dull and physical mind was left,\nl
Vacant of the bright spirit's luminous gaze.\nl
But once before it faded wholly back,\nl
He cried out in a clinging last despair,\nl
“Savitri, Savitri, O Savitri,\nl
Lean down, my soul, and kiss me while I die.”\nl
And even as her pallid lips pressed his,\nl
His failed, losing last sweetness of response;\nl
His cheek pressed down her golden arm. She sought\nl
His mouth still with her living mouth, as if\nl
She could persuade his soul back with her kiss;\nl
Then grew aware they were no more alone.\nl
Something had come there conscious, vast and dire.\nl
Near her she felt a silent shade immense\nl
Chilling the noon with darkness for its back.\nl
An awful hush had fallen upon the place:\nl
There was no cry of birds, no voice of beasts.\nl
A terror and an anguish filled the world,\nl
As if annihilation's mystery\nl
Had taken a sensible form. A cosmic mind\nl
Looked out on all from formidable eyes\nl
Contemning all with its unbearable gaze\nl
And with immortal lids and a vast brow\nl
It saw in its immense destroying thought\nl
All things and beings as a pitiful dream,\nl
Rejecting with calm disdain Nature's delight,\nl
The wordless meaning of its deep regard\nl
Voicing the unreality of things\nl
And life that would be for ever but never was\nl
And its brief and vain recurrence without cease,\nl
As if from a Silence without form or name\nl
Page 565

The Shadow of a remote uncaring god\nl
Doomed to his Nought the illusory universe,\nl
Cancelling its show of idea and act in Time\nl
And its imitation of eternity.\nl
She knew that visible Death was standing there\nl
And Satyavan had passed from her embrace.\nl

\sbigcap So was she left alone in the huge wood,\nl
Surrounded by a dim unthinking world,\nl
Her husband's corpse on her forsaken breast.\nl
In her vast silent spirit motionless\nl
She measured not her loss with helpless thoughts,\nl
Nor rent with tears the marble seals of pain:\nl
She rose not yet to face the dreadful god.\nl
Over the body she loved her soul leaned out\nl
In a great stillness without stir or voice,\nl
As if her mind had died with Satyavan.\nl
But still the human heart in her beat on.\nl
Aware still of his being near to hers,\nl
Closely she clasped to her the mute lifeless form\nl
As though to guard the oneness they had been\nl
And keep the spirit still within its frame.\nl
Then suddenly there came on her the change\nl
Which in tremendous moments of our lives\nl
Can overtake sometimes the human soul\nl
And hold it up towards its luminous source.\nl
The veil is torn, the thinker is no more:\nl
Only the spirit sees and all is known.\nl
Then a calm Power seated above our brows\nl
Is seen, unshaken by our thoughts and deeds,\nl
Its stillness bears the voices of the world:\nl
Immobile, it moves Nature, looks on life.\nl
It shapes immutably its far-seen ends;\nl
Untouched and tranquil amid error and tears\nl
And measureless above our striving wills,\nl
Its gaze controls the turbulent whirl of things.\nl
To mate with the Glory it sees, the spirit grows:\nl
The voice of life is tuned to infinite sounds,\nl
Page 571

The moments on great wings of lightning come\nl
And godlike thoughts surprise the mind of earth.\nl
Into the soul's splendour and intensity\nl
A crescent of miraculous birth is tossed,\nl
Whose horn of mystery floats in a bright void.\nl
As into a heaven of strength and silence thought\nl
Is ravished, all this living mortal clay\nl
Is seized and in a swift and fiery flood\nl
Of touches shaped by a Harmonist unseen.\nl
A new sight comes, new voices in us form\nl
A body of the music of the Gods.\nl
Immortal yearnings without name leap down,\nl
Large quiverings of godhead seeking run\nl
And weave upon a puissant field of calm\nl
A high and lonely ecstasy of will.\nl
This in a moment's depths was born in her.\nl
Now to the limitless gaze disclosed that sees\nl
Things barred from human thinking's earthly lids,\nl
The Spirit who had hidden in Nature soared\nl
Out of his luminous nest within the worlds:\nl
Like a vast fire it climbed the skies of night.\nl
Thus were the cords of self-oblivion torn:\nl
Like one who looks up to far heights she saw,\nl
Ancient and strong as on a windless summit\nl
Above her where she had worked in her lone mind\nl
Labouring apart in a sole tower of self,\nl
The source of all which she had seemed or wrought,\nl
A power projected into cosmic space,\nl
A slow embodiment of the aeonic will,\nl
A starry fragment of the eternal Truth,\nl
The passionate instrument of an unmoved Power.\nl
A Presence was there that filled the listening world;\nl
A central All assumed her boundless life.\nl
A sovereignty, a silence and a swiftness,\nl
One brooded over abysses who was she.\nl
As in a choric robe of unheard sounds\nl
Page 572

A Force descended trailing endless lights;\nl
Linking Time's seconds to infinity,\nl
Illimitably it girt the earth and her:\nl
It sank into her soul and she was changed.\nl
Then like a thought fulfilled by some great word\nl
That mightiness assumed a symbol form:\nl
Her being's spaces quivered with its touch,\nl
It covered her as with immortal wings;\nl
On its lips the curve of the unuttered Truth,\nl
A halo of Wisdom's lightnings for its crown,\nl
It entered the mystic lotus in her head,\nl
A thousand-petalled home of power and light.\nl
Immortal leader of her mortality,\nl
Doer of her works and fountain of her words,\nl
Invulnerable by Time, omnipotent,\nl
It stood above her calm, immobile, mute.\nl

\spar All in her mated with that mighty hour,\nl
As if the last remnant had been slain by Death\nl
Of the humanity that once was hers.\nl
Assuming a spiritual wide control,\nl
Making life's sea a mirror of heaven's sky,\nl
The young divinity in her earthly limbs\nl
Filled with celestial strength her mortal part.\nl
Over was the haunted pain, the rending fear:\nl
Her grief had passed away, her mind was still,\nl
Her heart beat quietly with a sovereign force.\nl
There came a freedom from the heart-strings' clutch,\nl
Now all her acts sprang from a godhead's calm.\nl
Calmly she laid upon the forest soil\nl
The dead who still reposed upon her breast\nl
And bore to turn away from the dead form:\nl
Sole now she rose to meet the dreadful god.\nl
That mightier spirit turned its mastering gaze\nl
On life and things, inheritor of a work\nl
Left to it unfinished from her halting past,\nl
Page 573

When yet the mind, a passionate learner, toiled\nl
And ill-shaped instruments were crudely moved.\nl
Transcended now was the poor human rule;\nl
A sovereign power was there, a godlike will.\nl
A moment yet she lingered motionless\nl
And looked down on the dead man at her feet;\nl
Then like a tree recovering from a wind\nl
She raised her noble head; fronting her gaze\nl
Something stood there, unearthly, sombre, grand,\nl
A limitless denial of all being\nl
That wore the terror and wonder of a shape.\nl
In its appalling eyes the tenebrous Form\nl
Bore the deep pity of destroying gods;\nl
A sorrowful irony curved the dreadful lips\nl
That speak the word of doom. Eternal Night\nl
In the dire beauty of an immortal face\nl
Pitying arose, receiving all that lives\nl
For ever into its fathomless heart, refuge\nl
Of creatures from their anguish and world-pain.\nl
His shape was nothingness made real, his limbs\nl
Were monuments of transience and beneath\nl
Brows of unwearying calm large godlike lids\nl
Silent beheld the writhing serpent, life.\nl
Unmoved their timeless wide unchanging gaze\nl
Had seen the unprofitable cycles pass,\nl
Survived the passing of unnumbered stars\nl
And sheltered still the same immutable orbs.\nl
The two opposed each other with their eyes,\nl
Woman and universal god: around her,\nl
Piling their void unbearable loneliness\nl
Upon her mighty uncompanioned soul,\nl
Many inhuman solitudes came close.\nl
Vacant eternities forbidding hope\nl
Laid upon her their huge and lifeless look,\nl
And to her ears, silencing earthly sounds,\nl
A sad and formidable voice arose\nl
Page 574

Which seemed the whole adverse world's. “Unclasp”, it cried,\nl
“Thy passionate influence and relax, O slave\nl
Of Nature, changing tool of changeless Law,\nl
Who vainly writh'st rebellion to my yoke,\nl
Thy elemental grasp; weep and forget.\nl
Entomb thy passion in its living grave.\nl
Leave now the once-loved spirit's abandoned robe:\nl
Pass lonely back to thy vain life on earth.”\nl
It ceased, she moved not, and it spoke again,\nl
Lowering its mighty key to human chords,—\nl
Yet a dread cry behind the uttered sounds,\nl
Echoing all sadness and immortal scorn,\nl
Moaned like a hunger of far wandering waves.\nl
“Wilt thou for ever keep thy passionate hold,\nl
Thyself a creature doomed like him to pass,\nl
Denying his soul death's calm and silent rest?\nl
Relax thy grasp; this body is earth's and thine,\nl
His spirit now belongs to a greater power.\nl
Woman, thy husband suffers.” Savitri\nl
Drew back her heart's force that clasped his body still\nl
Where from her lap renounced on the smooth grass\nl
Softly it lay, as often before in sleep\nl
When from their couch she rose in the white dawn\nl
Called by her daily tasks: now too, as if called,\nl
She rose and stood gathered in lonely strength,\nl
Like one who drops his mantle for a race\nl
And waits the signal, motionlessly swift.\nl
She knew not to what course: her spirit above\nl
On the crypt-summit of her secret form\nl
Like one left sentinel on a mountain crest,\nl
A fiery-footed splendour puissant-winged,\nl
Watched flaming-silent, with her voiceless soul\nl
Like a still sail upon a windless sea.\nl
White passionless it rode, an anchored might,\nl
Waiting what far-ridged impulse should arise\nl
Out of the eternal depths and cast its surge.\nl
Page 575

Then Death the king leaned boundless down, as leans\nl
Night over tired lands, when evening pales\nl
And fading gleams break down the horizon's walls,\nl
Nor yet the dusk grows mystic with the moon.\nl
The dim and awful godhead rose erect\nl
From his brief stooping to his touch on earth,\nl
And, like a dream that wakes out of a dream,\nl
Forsaking the poor mould of that dead clay,\nl
Another luminous Satyavan arose,\nl
Starting upright from the recumbent earth\nl
As if someone over viewless borders stepped\nl
Emerging on the edge of unseen worlds.\nl
In the earth's day the silent marvel stood\nl
Between the mortal woman and the god.\nl
Such seemed he as if one departed came\nl
Wearing the light of a celestial shape\nl
Splendidly alien to the mortal air.\nl
The mind sought things long loved and fell back foiled\nl
From unfamiliar hues, beheld yet longed,\nl
By the sweet radiant form unsatisfied,\nl
Incredulous of its too bright hints of heaven;\nl
Too strange the brilliant phantasm to life's clasp\nl
Desiring the warm creations of the earth\nl
Reared in the ardour of material suns,\nl
The senses seized in vain a glorious shade:\nl
Only the spirit knew the spirit still,\nl
And the heart divined the old loved heart, though changed.\nl
Between two realms he stood, not wavering,\nl
But fixed in quiet strong expectancy,\nl
Like one who, sightless, listens for a command.\nl
So were they immobile on that earthly field,\nl
Powers not of earth, though one in human clay.\nl
On either side of one two spirits strove;\nl
Silence battled with silence, vast with vast.\nl
But now the impulse of the Path was felt\nl
Moving from the Silence that supports the stars\nl
Page 576

To touch the confines of the visible world.\nl
Luminous he moved away; behind him Death\nl
Went slowly with his noiseless tread, as seen\nl
In dream-built fields a shadowy herdsman glides\nl
Behind some wanderer from his voiceless herds,\nl
And Savitri moved behind eternal Death,\nl
Her mortal pace was equalled with the god's.\nl
Wordless she travelled in her lover's steps,\nl
Planting her human feet where his had trod,\nl
Into the perilous silences beyond.\nl

\spar At first in a blind stress of woods she moved\nl
With strange inhuman paces on the soil,\nl
Journeying as if upon an unseen road.\nl
Around her on the green and imaged earth\nl
The flickering screen of forests ringed her steps;\nl
Its thick luxurious obstacle of boughs\nl
Besieged her body pressing dimly through\nl
In a rich realm of whispers palpable,\nl
And all the murmurous beauty of the leaves\nl
Rippled around her like an emerald robe.\nl
But more and more this grew an alien sound,\nl
And her old intimate body seemed to her\nl
A burden which her being remotely bore.\nl
Herself lived far in some uplifted scene\nl
Where to the trance-claimed vision of pursuit,\nl
Sole presences in a high spaceless dream,\nl
The luminous spirit glided stilly on\nl
And the great shadow travelled vague behind.\nl
Still with an amorous crowd of seeking hands\nl
Softly entreated by their old desires\nl
Her senses felt earth's close and gentle air\nl
Cling round them and in troubled branches knew\nl
Uncertain treadings of a faint-foot wind:\nl
She bore dim fragrances, far callings touched;\nl
The wild bird's voice and its winged rustle came\nl
Page 577

As if a sigh from some forgotten world.\nl
Earth stood aloof, yet near: round her it wove\nl
Its sweetness and its greenness and delight,\nl
Its brilliance suave of well-loved vivid hues,\nl
Sunlight arriving to its golden noon,\nl
And the blue heavens and the caressing soil.\nl
The ancient mother offered to her child\nl
Her simple world of kind familiar things.\nl
But now, as if the body's sensuous hold\nl
Curbing the godhead of her infinite walk\nl
Had freed those spirits to their grander road\nl
Across some boundary's intangible bar,\nl
The silent god grew mighty and remote\nl
In other spaces, and the soul she loved\nl
Lost its consenting nearness to her life.\nl
Into a deep and unfamiliar air\nl
Enormous, windless, without stir or sound\nl
They seemed to enlarge away, drawn by some wide\nl
Pale distance, from the warm control of earth\nl
And her grown far: now, now they would escape.\nl
Then flaming from her body's nest alarmed\nl
Her violent spirit soared at Satyavan.\nl
Out mid the plunge of heaven-surrounded rocks\nl
So in a terror and a wrath divine\nl
From her eyrie streams against the ascending death,\nl
Indignant at its crouching point of steel,\nl
A fierce she-eagle threatened in her brood,\nl
Borne on a rush of puissance and a cry,\nl
Outwinging like a mass of golden fire.\nl
So on a spirit's flaming outrush borne\nl
She crossed the borders of dividing sense;\nl
Like pale discarded sheaths dropped dully down\nl
Her mortal members fell back from her soul.\nl
A moment of a secret body's sleep,\nl
Her trance knew not of sun or earth or world;\nl
Thought, time and death were absent from her grasp:\nl
Page 578

She knew not self, forgotten was Savitri.\nl
All was the violent ocean of a will\nl
Where lived captive to an immense caress,\nl
Possessed in a supreme identity,\nl
Her aim, joy, origin, Satyavan alone.\nl
Her sovereign prisoned in her being's core,\nl
He beat there like a rhythmic heart,—herself\nl
But different still, one loved, enveloped, clasped,\nl
A treasure saved from the collapse of space.\nl
Around him nameless, infinite she surged,\nl
Her spirit fulfilled in his spirit, rich with all Time,\nl
As if Love's deathless moment had been found,\nl
A pearl within eternity's white shell.\nl
Then out of the engulfing sea of trance\nl
Her mind rose drenched to light streaming with hues\nl
Of vision and, awake once more to Time,\nl
Returned to shape the lineaments of things\nl
And live in borders of the seen and known.\nl
Onward the three still moved in her soul-scene.\nl
As if pacing through fragments of a dream,\nl
She seemed to travel on, a visioned shape\nl
Imagining other musers like herself,\nl
By them imagined in their lonely sleep.\nl
Ungrasped, unreal, yet familiar, old,\nl
Like clefts of unsubstantial memory,\nl
Scenes often traversed, never lived in, fled\nl
Past her unheeding to forgotten goals.\nl
In voiceless regions they were travellers\nl
Alone in a new world where souls were not,\nl
But only living moods: a strange hushed weird\nl
Country was round them, strange far skies above,\nl
A doubting space where dreaming objects lived\nl
Within themselves their one unchanged idea.\nl
Weird were the grasses, weird the treeless plains;\nl
Weird ran the road which like fear hastening\nl
Towards that of which it has most terror, passed\nl
Page 579

Phantasmal between pillared conscious rocks\nl
Sombre and high, gates brooding, whose stone thoughts\nl
Lost their huge sense beyond in giant night.\nl
Enigma of the Inconscient's sculptural sleep,\nl
Symbols of the approach to darkness old\nl
And monuments of her titanic reign,\nl
Opening to depths like dumb appalling jaws\nl
That wait a traveller down a haunted path\nl
Attracted to a mystery that slays,\nl
They watched across her road, cruel and still;\nl
Sentinels they stood of dumb Necessity,\nl
Mute heads of vigilant and sullen gloom,\nl
Carved muzzle of a dim enormous world.\nl
Then, to that chill sere heavy line arrived\nl
Where his feet touched the shadowy marches' brink,\nl
Turning arrested luminous Satyavan\nl
Looked back with his wonderful eyes at Savitri.\nl
But Death pealed forth his vast abysmal cry:\nl
“O mortal, turn back to thy transient kind;\nl
Aspire not to accompany Death to his home,\nl
As if thy breath could live where Time must die.\nl
Think not thy mind-born passion strength from heaven\nl
To uplift thy spirit from its earthly base\nl
And, breaking out from the material cage,\nl
To upbuoy thy feet of dream in groundless Nought\nl
And bear thee through the pathless infinite.\nl
Only in human limits man lives safe.\nl
Trust not in the unreal Lords of Time,\nl
Immortal deeming this image of thyself\nl
Which they have built on a Dream's floating ground.\nl
Let not the dreadful goddess move thy soul\nl
To enlarge thy vehement trespass into worlds\nl
Where it shall perish like a helpless thought.\nl
Know the cold term-stones of thy hopes in life.\nl
Armed vainly with the Ideal's borrowed might,\nl
Dare not to outstep man's bound and measured force:\nl
Page 580

Ignorant and stumbling, in brief boundaries pent,\nl
He crowns himself the world's mock suzerain,\nl
Tormenting Nature with the works of Mind.\nl
O sleeper, dreaming of divinity,\nl
Wake trembling mid the indifferent silences\nl
In which thy few weak chords of being die.\nl
Impermanent creatures, sorrowful foam of Time,\nl
Your transient loves bind not the eternal gods.”\nl
The dread voice ebbed in the consenting hush\nl
Which seemed to close upon it, wide, intense,\nl
A wordless sanction from the jaws of Night.\nl
The Woman answered not. Her high nude soul,\nl
Stripped of the girdle of mortality,\nl
Against fixed destiny and the grooves of law\nl
Stood up in its sheer will a primal force.\nl
Still like a statue on its pedestal,\nl
Lone in the silence and to vastness bared,\nl
Against midnight's dumb abysses piled in front\nl
A columned shaft of fire and light she rose.\nl

\ht Canto Two: The Journey in Eternal Night and the Voice of the Darkness
\par
\sbigcap Awhile on the chill dreadful edge of Night\nl
All stood as if a world were doomed to die\nl
And waited on the eternal silence' brink.\nl
Heaven leaned towards them like a cloudy brow\nl
Of menace through the dim and voiceless hush.\nl
As thoughts stand mute on a despairing verge\nl
Where the last depths plunge into nothingness\nl
And the last dreams must end, they paused; in their front\nl
Were glooms like shadowy wings, behind them, pale,\nl
The lifeless evening was a dead man's gaze.\nl
Hungry beyond, the night desired her soul.\nl
But still in its lone niche of templed strength\nl
Motionless, her flame-bright spirit, mute, erect,\nl
Burned like a torch-fire from a windowed room\nl
Pointing against the darkness' sombre breast.\nl
The Woman first affronted the Abyss\nl
Daring to journey through the eternal Night.\nl
Armoured with light she advanced her foot to plunge\nl
Into the dread and hueless vacancy;\nl
Immortal, unappalled, her spirit faced\nl
The danger of the ruthless eyeless waste.\nl
Against night's inky ground they stirred, moulding\nl
Mysterious motion on her human tread,\nl
A swimming action and a drifting march\nl
Like figures moving before eyelids closed:\nl
All as in dreams went slipping, gliding on.\nl
The rock-gate's heavy walls were left behind;\nl
As if through passages of receding time\nl
Present and past into the Timeless lapsed;\nl
Arrested upon dim adventure's brink,\nl
Page 582

The future ended drowned in nothingness.\nl
Amid collapsing shapes they wound obscure;\nl
The fading vestibules of a tenebrous world\nl
Received them, where they seemed to move and yet\nl
Be still, nowhere advancing yet to pass,\nl
A dumb procession a dim picture bounds,\nl
Not conscious forms threading a real scene.\nl
A mystery of terror's boundlessness,\nl
Gathering its hungry strength the huge pitiless void\nl
Surrounded slowly with its soundless depths,\nl
And monstrous, cavernous, a shapeless throat\nl
Devoured her into its shadowy strangling mass,\nl
The fierce spiritual agony of a dream.\nl
A curtain of impenetrable dread,\nl
The darkness hung around her cage of sense\nl
As, when the trees have turned to blotted shades\nl
And the last friendly glimmer fades away,\nl
Around a bullock in the forest tied\nl
By hunters closes in no empty night.\nl
The thought that strives in the world was here unmade;\nl
Its effort it renounced to live and know,\nl
Convinced at last that it had never been;\nl
It perished, all its dream of action done:\nl
This clotted cypher was its dark result.\nl
In the smothering stress of this stupendous Nought\nl
Mind could not think, breath could not breathe, the soul\nl
Could not remember or feel itself; it seemed\nl
A hollow gulf of sterile emptiness,\nl
A zero oblivious of the sum it closed,\nl
An abnegation of the Maker's joy\nl
Saved by no wide repose, no depth of peace.\nl
On all that claims here to be Truth and God\nl
And conscious self and the revealing Word\nl
And the creative rapture of the Mind\nl
And Love and Knowledge and heart's delight, there fell\nl
The immense refusal of the eternal No.\nl
Page 583

As disappears a golden lamp in gloom\nl
Borne into distance from the eyes' desire,\nl
Into the shadows vanished Savitri.\nl
There was no course, no path, no end or goal:\nl
Visionless she moved amid insensible gulfs,\nl
Or drove through some great black unknowing waste,\nl
Or whirled in a dumb eddy of meeting winds\nl
Assembled by the titan hands of Chance.\nl
There was none with her in the dreadful Vast:\nl
She saw no more the vague tremendous god,\nl
Her eyes had lost their luminous Satyavan.\nl
Yet not for this her spirit failed, but held\nl
More deeply than the bounded senses can\nl
Which grasp externally and find to lose,\nl
Its object loved. So when on earth they lived\nl
She had felt him straying through the glades, the glades\nl
A scene in her, its clefts her being's vistas\nl
Opening their secrets to his search and joy,\nl
Because to jealous sweetness in her heart\nl
Whatever happy space his cherished feet\nl
Preferred, must be at once her soul embracing\nl
His body, passioning dumbly to his tread.\nl
But now a silent gulf between them came\nl
And to abysmal loneliness she fell,\nl
Even from herself cast out, from love remote.\nl
Long hours, since long it seems when sluggish time\nl
Is measured by the throbs of the soul's pain,\nl
In an unreal darkness empty and drear\nl
She travelled treading on the corpse of life,\nl
Lost in a blindness of extinguished souls.\nl
Solitary in the anguish of the void\nl
She lived in spite of death, she conquered still;\nl
In vain her puissant being was oppressed:\nl
Her heavy long monotony of pain\nl
Tardily of its fierce self-torture tired.\nl
At first a faint inextinguishable gleam,\nl
Page 584

Pale but immortal, flickered in the gloom\nl
As if a memory came to spirits dead,\nl
A memory that wished to live again,\nl
Dissolved from mind in Nature's natal sleep.\nl
It wandered like a lost ray of the moon\nl
Revealing to the night her soul of dread;\nl
Serpentine in the gleam the darkness lolled,\nl
Its black hoods jewelled with the mystic glow;\nl
Its dull sleek folds shrank back and coiled and slid,\nl
As though they felt all light a cruel pain\nl
And suffered from the pale approach of hope.\nl
Night felt assailed her heavy sombre reign;\nl
The splendour of some bright eternity\nl
Threatened with this faint beam of wandering Truth\nl
Her empire of the everlasting Nought.\nl
Implacable in her intolerant strength\nl
And confident that she alone was true,\nl
She strove to stifle the frail dangerous ray;\nl
Aware of an all-negating immensity\nl
She reared her giant head of Nothingness,\nl
Her mouth of darkness swallowing all that is;\nl
She saw in herself the tenebrous Absolute.\nl
But still the light prevailed and still it grew,\nl
And Savitri to her lost self awoke;\nl
Her limbs refused the cold embrace of death,\nl
Her heart-beats triumphed in the grasp of pain;\nl
Her soul persisted claiming for its joy\nl
The soul of the beloved now seen no more.\nl
Before her in the stillness of the world\nl
Once more she heard the treading of a god,\nl
And out of the dumb darkness Satyavan,\nl
Her husband, grew into a luminous shade.\nl
Then a sound pealed through that dead monstrous realm:\nl
Vast like the surge in a tired swimmer's ears,\nl
Clamouring, a fatal iron-hearted roar,\nl
Death missioned to the night his lethal call.\nl
Page 585

“This is my silent dark immensity,\nl
This is the home of everlasting Night,\nl
This is the secrecy of Nothingness\nl
Entombing the vanity of life's desires.\nl
Hast thou beheld thy source, O transient heart,\nl
And known from what the dream thou art was made?\nl
In this stark sincerity of nude emptiness\nl
Hopest thou still always to last and love?”\nl
The Woman answered not. Her spirit refused\nl
The voice of Night that knew and Death that thought.\nl
In her beginningless infinity\nl
Through her soul's reaches unconfined she gazed;\nl
She saw the undying fountains of her life,\nl
She knew herself eternal without birth.\nl
But still opposing her with endless night\nl
Death, the dire god, inflicted on her eyes\nl
The immortal calm of his tremendous gaze:\nl
“Although thou hast survived the unborn void\nl
Which never shall forgive, while Time endures,\nl
The primal violence that fashioned thought,\nl
Forcing the immobile vast to suffer and live,\nl
This sorrowful victory only hast thou won\nl
To live for a little without Satyavan.\nl
What shall the ancient goddess give to thee\nl
Who helps thy heart-beats? Only she prolongs\nl
The nothing dreamed existence and delays\nl
With the labour of living thy eternal sleep.\nl
A fragile miracle of thinking clay,\nl
Armed with illusions walks the child of Time.\nl
To fill the void around he feels and dreads,\nl
The void he came from and to which he goes,\nl
He magnifies his self and names it God.\nl
He calls the heavens to help his suffering hopes.\nl
He sees above him with a longing heart\nl
Bare spaces more unconscious than himself\nl
That have not even his privilege of mind,\nl
Page 586

And empty of all but their unreal blue,\nl
And peoples them with bright and merciful powers.\nl
For the sea roars around him and earth quakes\nl
Beneath his steps, and fire is at his doors,\nl
And death prowls baying through the woods of life.\nl
Moved by the Presences with which he yearns,\nl
He offers in implacable shrines his soul\nl
And clothes all with the beauty of his dreams.\nl
The gods who watch the earth with sleepless eyes\nl
And guide its giant stumblings through the void,\nl
Have given to man the burden of his mind;\nl
In his unwilling heart they have lit their fires\nl
And sown in it incurable unrest.\nl
His mind is a hunter upon tracks unknown;\nl
Amusing Time with vain discovery,\nl
He deepens with thought the mystery of his fate\nl
And turns to song his laughter and his tears.\nl
His mortality vexing with the immortal's dreams,\nl
Troubling his transience with the infinite's breath,\nl
They gave him hungers which no food can fill;\nl
He is the cattle of the shepherd gods.\nl
His body the tether with which he is tied,\nl
They cast for fodder grief and hope and joy:\nl
His pasture ground they have fenced with Ignorance.\nl
Into his fragile undefended breast\nl
They have breathed a courage that is met by death,\nl
They have given a wisdom that is mocked by night,\nl
They have traced a journey that foresees no goal.\nl
Aimless man toils in an uncertain world,\nl
Lulled by inconstant pauses of his pain,\nl
Scourged like a beast by the infinite desire,\nl
Bound to the chariot of the dreadful gods.\nl
But if thou still canst hope and still wouldst love,\nl
Return to thy body's shell, thy tie to earth,\nl
And with thy heart's little remnants try to live.\nl
Hope not to win back to thee Satyavan.\nl
Page 587

Yet since thy strength deserves no trivial crown,\nl
Gifts I can give to soothe thy wounded life.\nl
The pacts which transient beings make with fate,\nl
And the wayside sweetness earth-bound hearts would pluck,\nl
These if thy will accepts make freely thine.\nl
Choose a life's hopes for thy deceiving prize.”\nl
As ceased the ruthless and tremendous Voice,\nl
Unendingly there rose in Savitri,\nl
Like moonlit ridges on a shuddering flood,\nl
A stir of thoughts out of some silence born\nl
Across the sea of her dumb fathomless heart.\nl
At last she spoke; her voice was heard by Night:\nl
“I bow not to thee, O huge mask of death,\nl
Black lie of night to the cowed soul of man,\nl
Unreal, inescapable end of things,\nl
Thou grim jest played with the immortal spirit.\nl
Conscious of immortality I walk.\nl
A victor spirit conscious of my force,\nl
Not as a suppliant to thy gates I came:\nl
Unslain I have survived the clutch of Night.\nl
My first strong grief moves not my seated mind;\nl
My unwept tears have turned to pearls of strength:\nl
I have transformed my ill-shaped brittle clay\nl
Into the hardness of a statued soul.\nl
Now in the wrestling of the splendid gods\nl
My spirit shall be obstinate and strong\nl
Against the vast refusal of the world.\nl
I stoop not with the subject mob of minds\nl
Who run to glean with eager satisfied hands\nl
And pick from its mire mid many trampling feet\nl
Its scornful small concessions to the weak.\nl
Mine is the labour of the battling gods:\nl
Imposing on the slow reluctant years\nl
The flaming will that reigns beyond the stars,\nl
They lay the law of Mind on Matter's works\nl
And win the soul's wish from earth's inconscient Force.\nl
Page 588

First I demand whatever Satyavan,\nl
My husband, waking in the forest's charm\nl
Out of his long pure childhood's lonely dreams,\nl
Desired and had not for his beautiful life.\nl
Give, if thou must, or, if thou canst, refuse.”\nl
Death bowed his head in scornful cold assent,\nl
The builder of this dreamlike earth for man\nl
Who has mocked with vanity all gifts he gave.\nl
Uplifting his disastrous voice he spoke:\nl
“Indulgent to the dreams my touch shall break,\nl
I yield to his blind father's longing heart\nl
Kingdom and power and friends and greatness lost\nl
And royal trappings for his peaceful age,\nl
The pallid pomps of man's declining days,\nl
The silvered decadent glories of life's fall.\nl
To one who wiser grew by adverse Fate,\nl
Goods I restore the deluded soul prefers\nl
To impersonal nothingness's bare sublime.\nl
The sensuous solace of the light I give\nl
To eyes which could have found a larger realm,\nl
A deeper vision in their fathomless night.\nl
For that this man desired and asked in vain\nl
While still he lived on earth and cherished hope.\nl
Back from the grandeur of my perilous realms\nl
Go, mortal, to thy small permitted sphere!\nl
Hasten swift-footed, lest to slay thy life\nl
The great laws thou hast violated, moved,\nl
Open at last on thee their marble eyes.”\nl
But Savitri answered the disdainful Shade:\nl
“World-spirit, I was thy equal spirit born.\nl
My will too is a law, my strength a god.\nl
I am immortal in my mortality.\nl
I tremble not before the immobile gaze\nl
Of the unchanging marble hierarchies\nl
That look with the stone eyes of Law and Fate.\nl
My soul can meet them with its living fire.\nl
Page 589

Out of thy shadow give me back again\nl
Into earth's flowering spaces Satyavan\nl
In the sweet transiency of human limbs\nl
To do with him my spirit's burning will.\nl
I will bear with him the ancient Mother's load,\nl
I will follow with him earth's path that leads to God.\nl
Else shall the eternal spaces open to me,\nl
While round us strange horizons far recede,\nl
Travelling together the immense unknown.\nl
For I who have trod with him the tracts of Time,\nl
Can meet behind his steps whatever night\nl
Or unimaginable stupendous dawn\nl
Breaks on our spirits in the untrod Beyond.\nl
Wherever thou leadst his soul I shall pursue.”\nl
But to her claim opposed, implacable,\nl
Insisting on the immutable Decree,\nl
Insisting on the immitigable Law\nl
And the insignificance of created things,\nl
Out of the rolling wastes of night there came\nl
Born from the enigma of the unknowable depths\nl
A voice of majesty and appalling scorn.\nl
As when the storm-haired Titan-striding sea\nl
Throws on a swimmer its tremendous laugh\nl
Remembering all the joy its waves have drowned,\nl
So from the darkness of the sovereign night\nl
Against the Woman's boundless heart arose\nl
The almighty cry of universal Death.\nl
“Hast thou god-wings or feet that tread my stars,\nl
Frail creature with the courage that aspires,\nl
Forgetting thy bounds of thought, thy mortal role?\nl
Their orbs were coiled before thy soul was formed.\nl
I, Death, created them out of my void;\nl
All things I have built in them and I destroy.\nl
I made the worlds my net, each joy a mesh.\nl
A Hunger amorous of its suffering prey,\nl
Life that devours, my image see in things.\nl
Page 590

Mortal, whose spirit is my wandering breath,\nl
Whose transience was imagined by my smile,\nl
Flee clutching thy poor gains to thy trembling breast\nl
Pierced by my pangs Time shall not soon appease.\nl
Blind slave of my deaf force whom I compel\nl
To sin that I may punish, to desire\nl
That I may scourge thee with despair and grief\nl
And thou come bleeding to me at the last,\nl
Thy nothingness recognised, my greatness known,\nl
Turn nor attempt forbidden happy fields\nl
Meant for the souls that can obey my law,\nl
Lest in their sombre shrines thy tread awake\nl
From their uneasy iron-hearted sleep\nl
The Furies who avenge fulfilled desire.\nl
Dread lest in skies where passion hoped to live,\nl
The Unknown's lightnings start and, terrified,\nl
Lone, sobbing, hunted by the hounds of heaven,\nl
A wounded and forsaken soul thou flee\nl
Through the long torture of the centuries,\nl
Nor many lives exhaust the tireless Wrath\nl
Hell cannot slake nor Heaven's mercy assuage.\nl
I will take from thee the black eternal grip:\nl
Clasping in thy heart thy fate's exiguous dole\nl
Depart in peace, if peace for man is just.”\nl
But Savitri answered meeting scorn with scorn,\nl
The mortal woman to the dreadful Lord:\nl
“Who is this God imagined by thy night,\nl
Contemptuously creating worlds disdained,\nl
Who made for vanity the brilliant stars?\nl
Not he who has reared his temple in my thoughts\nl
And made his sacred floor my human heart.\nl
My God is will and triumphs in his paths,\nl
My God is love and sweetly suffers all.\nl
To him I have offered hope for sacrifice\nl
And gave my longings as a sacrament.\nl
Who shall prohibit or hedge in his course,\nl
Page 591

The wonderful, the charioteer, the swift?\nl
A traveller of the million roads of life,\nl
His steps familiar with the lights of heaven\nl
Tread without pain the sword-paved courts of hell;\nl
There he descends to edge eternal joy.\nl
Love's golden wings have power to fan thy void:\nl
The eyes of love gaze starlike through death's night,\nl
The feet of love tread naked hardest worlds.\nl
He labours in the depths, exults on the heights;\nl
He shall remake thy universe, O Death.”\nl
She spoke and for a while no voice replied,\nl
While still they travelled through the trackless night\nl
And still that gleam was like a pallid eye\nl
Troubling the darkness with its doubtful gaze.\nl
Then once more came a deep and perilous pause\nl
In that unreal journey through blind Nought;\nl
Once more a Thought, a Word in the void arose\nl
And Death made answer to the human soul:\nl
“What is thy hope? to what dost thou aspire?\nl
This is thy body's sweetest lure of bliss,\nl
Assailed by pain, a frail precarious form,\nl
To please for a few years thy faltering sense\nl
With honey of physical longings and the heart's fire\nl
And, a vain oneness seeking, to embrace\nl
The brilliant idol of a fugitive hour.\nl
And thou, what art thou, soul, thou glorious dream\nl
Of brief emotions made and glittering thoughts,\nl
A thin dance of fireflies speeding through the night,\nl
A sparkling ferment in life's sunlit mire?\nl
Wilt thou claim immortality, O heart,\nl
Crying against the eternal witnesses\nl
That thou and he are endless powers and last?\nl
Death only lasts and the inconscient Void.\nl
I only am eternal and endure.\nl
I am the shapeless formidable Vast,\nl
I am the emptiness that men call Space,\nl
Page 592

I am a timeless Nothingness carrying all,\nl
I am the Illimitable, the mute Alone.\nl
I, Death, am He; there is no other God.\nl
All from my depths are born, they live by death;\nl
All to my depths return and are no more.\nl
I have made a world by my inconscient Force.\nl
My Force is Nature that creates and slays\nl
The hearts that hope, the limbs that long to live.\nl
I have made man her instrument and slave,\nl
His body I made my banquet, his life my food.\nl
Man has no other help but only Death;\nl
He comes to me at his end for rest and peace.\nl
I, Death, am the one refuge of thy soul.\nl
The Gods to whom man prays can help not man;\nl
They are my imaginations and my moods\nl
Reflected in him by illusion's power.\nl
That which thou seest as thy immortal self\nl
Is a shadowy icon of my infinite,\nl
Is Death in thee dreaming of eternity.\nl
I am the Immobile in which all things move,\nl
I am the nude Inane in which they cease:\nl
I have no body and no tongue to speak,\nl
I commune not with human eye and ear;\nl
Only thy thought gave a figure to my void.\nl
Because, O aspirant to divinity,\nl
Thou calledst me to wrestle with thy soul,\nl
I have assumed a face, a form, a voice.\nl
But if there were a Being witnessing all,\nl
How should he help thy passionate desire?\nl
Aloof he watches sole and absolute,\nl
Indifferent to thy cry in nameless calm.\nl
His being is pure, unwounded, motionless, one.\nl
One endless watches the inconscient scene\nl
Where all things perish, as the foam the stars.\nl
The One lives for ever. There no Satyavan\nl
Changing was born and there no Savitri\nl
Page 593

Claims from brief life her bribe of joy. There love\nl
Came never with his fretful eyes of tears,\nl
Nor Time is there nor the vain vasts of Space.\nl
It wears no living face, it has no name,\nl
No gaze, no heart that throbs; it asks no second\nl
To aid its being or to share its joys.\nl
It is delight immortally alone.\nl
If thou desirest immortality,\nl
Be then alone sufficient to thy soul:\nl
Live in thyself; forget the man thou lov'st.\nl
My last grand death shall rescue thee from life;\nl
Then shalt thou rise into thy unmoved source.”\nl
But Savitri replied to the dread Voice:\nl
“O Death, who reasonest, I reason not,\nl
Reason that scans and breaks, but cannot build\nl
Or builds in vain because she doubts her work.\nl
I am, I love, I see, I act, I will.”\nl
Death answered her, one deep surrounding cry:\nl
“Know also. Knowing, thou shalt cease to love\nl
And cease to will, delivered from thy heart.\nl
So shalt thou rest for ever and be still,\nl
Consenting to the impermanence of things.”\nl
But Savitri replied for man to Death:\nl
“When I have loved for ever, I shall know.\nl
Love in me knows the truth all changings mask.\nl
I know that knowledge is a vast embrace:\nl
I know that every being is myself,\nl
In every heart is hidden the myriad One.\nl
I know the calm Transcendent bears the world,\nl
The veiled Inhabitant, the silent Lord:\nl
I feel his secret act, his intimate fire;\nl
I hear the murmur of the cosmic Voice.\nl
I know my coming was a wave from God.\nl
For all his suns were conscient in my birth,\nl
And one who loves in us came veiled by death.\nl
Then was man born among the monstrous stars\nl
Page 594

Dowered with a mind and heart to conquer thee.”\nl
In the eternity of his ruthless will\nl
Sure of his empire and his armoured might,\nl
Like one disdaining violent helpless words\nl
From victim lips Death answered not again.\nl
He stood in silence and in darkness wrapped,\nl
A figure motionless, a shadow vague,\nl
Girt with the terrors of his secret sword.\nl
Half-seen in clouds appeared a sombre face;\nl
Night's dusk tiara was his matted hair,\nl
The ashes of the pyre his forehead's sign.\nl
Once more a wanderer in the unending Night,\nl
Blindly forbidden by dead vacant eyes,\nl
She travelled through the dumb unhoping vasts.\nl
Around her rolled the shuddering waste of gloom,\nl
Its swallowing emptiness and joyless death\nl
Resentful of her thought and life and love.\nl
Through the long fading night by her compelled,\nl
Gliding half-seen on their unearthly path,\nl
Phantasmal in the dimness moved the three.\nl

\sbigcap All still was darkness dread and desolate;\nl
There was no change nor any hope of change.\nl
In this black dream which was a house of Void,\nl
A walk to Nowhere in a land of Nought,\nl
Ever they drifted without aim or goal;\nl
Gloom led to worse gloom, depth to an emptier depth,\nl
In some positive Non-being's purposeless Vast\nl
Through formless wastes dumb and unknowable.\nl
An ineffectual beam of suffering light\nl
Through the despairing darkness dogged their steps\nl
Like the remembrance of a glory lost;\nl
Even while it grew, it seemed unreal there,\nl
Yet haunted Nihil's chill stupendous realm,\nl
Unquenchable, perpetual, lonely, null,\nl
A pallid ghost of some dead eternity.\nl
It was as if she must pay now her debt,\nl
Her vain presumption to exist and think,\nl
To some brilliant Maya that conceived her soul.\nl
This most she must absolve with endless pangs,\nl
Her deep original sin, the will to be\nl
And the sin last, greatest, the spiritual pride,\nl
That, made of dust, equalled itself with heaven,\nl
Its scorn of the worm writhing in the mud,\nl
Condemned ephemeral, born from Nature's dream,\nl
Refusal of the transient creature's role,\nl
The claim to be a living fire of God,\nl
The will to be immortal and divine.\nl
In that tremendous darkness heavy and bare\nl
She atoned for all since the first act whence sprang\nl
The error of the consciousness of Time,\nl
The rending of the Inconscient's seal of sleep,\nl
Page 599

The primal and unpardoned revolt that broke\nl
The peace and silence of the Nothingness\nl
Which was before a seeming universe\nl
Appeared in a vanity of imagined Space\nl
And life arose engendering grief and pain:\nl
A great Negation was the Real's face\nl
Prohibiting the vain process of Time:\nl
And when there is no world, no creature more,\nl
When Time's intrusion has been blotted out,\nl
It shall last, unbodied, saved from thought, at peace.\nl
Accursed in what had been her godhead source,\nl
Condemned to live for ever empty of bliss,\nl
Her immortality her chastisement,\nl
Her spirit, guilty of being, wandered doomed,\nl
Moving for ever through eternal Night.\nl
But Maya is a veil of the Absolute;\nl
A Truth occult has made this mighty world:\nl
The Eternal's wisdom and self-knowledge act\nl
In ignorant Mind and in the body's steps.\nl
The Inconscient is the Superconscient's sleep.\nl
An unintelligible Intelligence\nl
Invents creation's paradox profound;\nl
Spiritual thought is crammed in Matter's forms,\nl
Unseen it throws out a dumb energy\nl
And works a miracle by a machine.\nl
All here is a mystery of contraries:\nl
Darkness a magic of self-hidden Light,\nl
Suffering some secret rapture's tragic mask\nl
And death an instrument of perpetual life.\nl
Although Death walks beside us on Life's road,\nl
A dim bystander at the body's start\nl
And a last judgment on man's futile works,\nl
Other is the riddle of its ambiguous face:\nl
Death is a stair, a door, a stumbling stride\nl
The soul must take to cross from birth to birth,\nl
A grey defeat pregnant with victory,\nl
Page 600

A whip to lash us towards our deathless state.\nl
The inconscient world is the spirit's self-made room,\nl
Eternal Night shadow of eternal Day.\nl
Night is not our beginning nor our end;\nl
She is the dark Mother in whose womb we have hid\nl
Safe from too swift a waking to world-pain.\nl
We came to her from a supernal Light,\nl
By Light we live and to the Light we go.\nl
Here in this seat of Darkness mute and lone,\nl
In the heart of everlasting Nothingness\nl
Light conquered now even by that feeble beam:\nl
Its faint infiltration drilled the blind deaf mass;\nl
Almost it changed into a glimmering sight\nl
That housed the phantom of an aureate Sun\nl
Whose orb pupilled the eye of Nothingness.\nl
A golden fire came in and burned Night's heart;\nl
Her dusky mindlessness began to dream;\nl
The Inconscient conscious grew, Night felt and thought.\nl
Assailed in the sovereign emptiness of its reign\nl
The intolerant Darkness paled and drew apart\nl
Till only a few black remnants stained that Ray.\nl
But on a failing edge of dumb lost space\nl
Still a great dragon body sullenly loomed;\nl
Adversary of the slow struggling Dawn\nl
Defending its ground of tortured mystery,\nl
It trailed its coils through the dead martyred air\nl
And curving fled down a grey slope of Time.\nl

\spar There is a morning twilight of the gods;\nl
Miraculous from sleep their forms arise\nl
And God's long nights are justified by dawn.\nl
There breaks a passion and splendour of new birth\nl
And hue-winged visions stray across the lids,\nl
Heaven's chanting heralds waken dim-eyed Space.\nl
The dreaming deities look beyond the seen\nl
And fashion in their thoughts the ideal worlds\nl
Page 601

Sprung from a limitless moment of desire\nl
That once had lodged in some abysmal heart.\nl
Passed was the heaviness of the eyeless dark\nl
And all the sorrow of the night was dead:\nl
Surprised by a blind joy with groping hands\nl
Like one who wakes to find his dreams were true,\nl
Into a happy misty twilit world\nl
Where all ran after light and joy and love\nl
She slipped; there far-off raptures drew more close\nl
And deep anticipations of delight,\nl
For ever eager to be grasped and held,\nl
Were never grasped, yet breathed strange ecstasy.\nl
A pearl-winged indistinctness fleeting swam,\nl
An air that dared not suffer too much light.\nl
Vague fields were there, vague pastures gleamed, vague trees,\nl
Vague scenes dim-hearted in a drifting haze;\nl
Vague cattle white roamed glimmering through the mist;\nl
Vague spirits wandered with a bodiless cry,\nl
Vague melodies touched the soul and fled pursued\nl
Into harmonious distances unseized;\nl
Forms subtly elusive and half-luminous powers\nl
Wishing no goal for their unearthly course\nl
Strayed happily through vague ideal lands,\nl
Or floated without footing or their walk\nl
Left steps of reverie on sweet memory's ground;\nl
Or they paced to the mighty measure of their thoughts\nl
Led by a low far chanting of the gods.\nl
A ripple of gleaming wings crossed the far sky;\nl
Birds like pale-bosomed imaginations flew\nl
With low disturbing voices of desire,\nl
And half-heard lowings drew the listening ear,\nl
As if the Sun-god's brilliant kine were there\nl
Hidden in mist and passing towards the sun.\nl
These fugitive beings, these elusive shapes\nl
Were all that claimed the eye and met the soul,\nl
The natural inhabitants of that world.\nl
Page 602

But nothing there was fixed or stayed for long;\nl
No mortal feet could rest upon that soil,\nl
No breath of life lingered embodied there.\nl
In that fine chaos joy fled dancing past\nl
And beauty evaded settled line and form\nl
And hid its sense in mysteries of hue;\nl
Yet gladness ever repeated the same notes\nl
And gave the sense of an enduring world;\nl
There was a strange consistency of shapes,\nl
And the same thoughts were constant passers-by\nl
And all renewed unendingly its charm\nl
Alluring ever the expectant heart\nl
Like music that one always waits to hear,\nl
Like the recurrence of a haunting rhyme.\nl
One touched incessantly things never seized,\nl
A skirt of worlds invisibly divine.\nl
As if a trail of disappearing stars\nl
There showered upon the floating atmosphere\nl
Colours and lights and evanescent gleams\nl
That called to follow into a magic heaven,\nl
And in each cry that fainted on the ear\nl
There was the voice of an unrealised bliss.\nl
An adoration reigned in the yearning heart,\nl
A spirit of purity, an elusive presence\nl
Of faery beauty and ungrasped delight\nl
Whose momentary and escaping thrill,\nl
However unsubstantial to our flesh,\nl
And brief even in imperishableness,\nl
Much sweeter seemed than any rapture known\nl
Earth or all-conquering heaven can ever give.\nl
Heaven ever young and earth too firm and old\nl
Delay the heart by immobility:\nl
Their raptures of creation last too long,\nl
Their bold formations are too absolute;\nl
Carved by an anguish of divine endeavour\nl
They stand up sculptured on the eternal hills,\nl
Page 603

Or quarried from the living rocks of God\nl
Win immortality by perfect form.\nl
They are too intimate with eternal things:\nl
Vessels of infinite significances,\nl
They are too clear, too great, too meaningful;\nl
No mist or shadow soothes the vanquished sight,\nl
No soft penumbra of incertitude.\nl
These only touched a golden hem of bliss,\nl
The gleaming shoulder of some godlike hope,\nl
The flying feet of exquisite desires.\nl
On a slow trembling brink between night and day\nl
They shone like visitants from the morning star,\nl
Satisfied beginnings of perfection, first\nl
Tremulous imaginings of a heavenly world:\nl
They mingle in a passion of pursuit,\nl
Thrilled with a spray of joy too slight to tire.\nl
All in this world was shadowed forth, not limned,\nl
Like faces leaping on a fan of fire\nl
Or shapes of wonder in a tinted blur,\nl
Like fugitive landscapes painting silver mists.\nl
Here vision fled back from the sight alarmed,\nl
And sound sought refuge from the ear's surprise,\nl
And all experience was a hasty joy.\nl
The joys here snatched were half-forbidden things,\nl
Timorous soul-bridals delicately veiled\nl
As when a goddess' bosom dimly moves\nl
To first desire and her white soul transfigured,\nl
A glimmering Eden crossed by faery gleams,\nl
Trembles to expectation's fiery wand,\nl
But nothing is familiar yet with bliss.\nl
All things in this fair realm were heavenly strange\nl
In a fleeting gladness of untired delight,\nl
In an insistency of magic change.\nl
Past vanishing hedges, hurrying hints of fields,\nl
Mid swift escaping lanes that fled her feet\nl
Journeying she wished no end: as one through clouds\nl
Page 604

Travels upon a mountain ridge and hears\nl
Arising to him out of hidden depths\nl
Sound of invisible streams, she walked besieged\nl
By the illusion of a mystic space,\nl
A charm of bodiless touches felt and heard\nl
A sweetness as of voices high and dim\nl
Calling like travellers upon seeking winds\nl
Melodiously with an alluring cry.\nl
As if a music old yet ever new,\nl
Moving suggestions on her heart-strings dwelt,\nl
Thoughts that no habitation found, yet clung\nl
With passionate repetition to her mind,\nl
Desires that hurt not, happy only to live\nl
Always the same and always unfulfilled\nl
Sang in the breast like a celestial lyre.\nl
Thus all could last yet nothing ever be.\nl
In this beauty as of mind made visible,\nl
Dressed in its rays of wonder Satyavan\nl
Before her seemed the centre of its charm,\nl
Head of her loveliness of longing dreams\nl
And captain of the fancies of her soul.\nl
Even the dreadful majesty of Death's face\nl
And its sombre sadness could not darken nor slay\nl
The intangible lustre of those fleeting skies.\nl
The sombre Shadow sullen, implacable\nl
Made beauty and laughter more imperative;\nl
Enhanced by his grey, joy grew more bright and dear;\nl
His dark contrast edging ideal sight\nl
Deepened unuttered meanings to the heart;\nl
Pain grew a trembling undertone of bliss\nl
And transience immortality's floating hem,\nl
A moment's robe in which she looked more fair,\nl
Its antithesis sharpening her divinity.\nl
A comrade of the Ray and Mist and Flame,\nl
By a moon-bright face a brilliant moment drawn,\nl
Almost she seemed a thought mid floating thoughts,\nl
Page 605

Seen hardly by a visionary mind\nl
Amid the white inward musings of the soul.\nl
Half-vanquished by the dream-happiness around,\nl
Awhile she moved on an enchantment's soil,\nl
But still remained possessor of her soul.\nl
Above, her spirit in its mighty trance\nl
Saw all, but lived for its transcendent task,\nl
Immutable like a fixed eternal star.\nl

\sbigcap Then pealed the calm inexorable voice:\nl
Abolishing hope, cancelling life's golden truths,\nl
Fatal its accents smote the trembling air.\nl
That lovely world swam thin and frail, most like\nl
Some pearly evanescent farewell gleam\nl
On the faint verge of dusk in moonless eves.\nl
“Prisoner of Nature, many-visioned spirit,\nl
Thought's creature in the ideal's realm enjoying\nl
Thy unsubstantial immortality\nl
The subtle marvellous mind of man has feigned,\nl
This is the world from which thy yearnings came.\nl
When it would build eternity from the dust,\nl
Man's thought paints images illusion rounds;\nl
Prophesying glories it shall never see,\nl
It labours delicately among its dreams.\nl
Behold this fleeing of light-tasselled shapes,\nl
Aerial raiment of unbodied gods;\nl
A rapture of things that never can be born,\nl
Hope chants to hope a bright immortal choir;\nl
Cloud satisfies cloud, phantom to longing phantom\nl
Leans sweetly, sweetly is clasped or sweetly chased.\nl
This is the stuff from which the ideal is formed:\nl
Its builder is thought, its base the heart's desire,\nl
But nothing real answers to their call.\nl
The ideal dwells not in heaven, nor on the earth,\nl
A bright delirium of man's ardour of hope\nl
Drunk with the wine of its own fantasy.\nl
It is a brilliant shadow's dreamy trail.\nl
Thy vision's error builds the azure skies,\nl
Thy vision's error drew the rainbow's arch;\nl
Page 607

Thy mortal longing made for thee a soul.\nl
This angel in thy body thou callst love,\nl
Who shapes his wings from thy emotion's hues,\nl
In a ferment of thy body has been born\nl
And with the body that housed it it must die.\nl
It is a passion of thy yearning cells,\nl
It is flesh that calls to flesh to serve its lust;\nl
It is thy mind that seeks an answering mind\nl
And dreams awhile that it has found its mate;\nl
It is thy life that asks a human prop\nl
To uphold its weakness lonely in the world\nl
Or feeds its hunger on another's life.\nl
A beast of prey that pauses in its prowl,\nl
It crouches under a bush in splendid flower\nl
To seize a heart and body for its food:\nl
This beast thou dreamst immortal and a god.\nl
O human mind, vainly thou torturest\nl
An hour's delight to stretch through infinity's\nl
Long void and fill its formless, passionless gulfs,\nl
Persuading the insensible Abyss\nl
To lend eternity to perishing things,\nl
And trickst the fragile movements of thy heart\nl
With thy spirit's feint of immortality.\nl
All here emerges born from Nothingness;\nl
Encircled it lasts by the emptiness of Space,\nl
Awhile upheld by an unknowing Force,\nl
Then crumbles back into its parent Nought:\nl
Only the mute Alone can for ever be.\nl
In the Alone there is no room for love.\nl
In vain to clothe love's perishable mud\nl
Thou hast woven on the Immortals' borrowed loom\nl
The ideal's gorgeous and unfading robe.\nl
The ideal never yet was real made.\nl
Imprisoned in form that glory cannot live;\nl
Into a body shut it breathes no more.\nl
Intangible, remote, for ever pure,\nl
Page 608

A sovereign of its own brilliant void,\nl
Unwillingly it descends to earthly air\nl
To inhabit a white temple in man's heart:\nl
In his heart it shines rejected by his life.\nl
Immutable, bodiless, beautiful, grand and dumb,\nl
Immobile on its shining throne it sits;\nl
Dumb it receives his offering and his prayer.\nl
It has no voice to answer to his call,\nl
No feet that move, no hands to take his gifts:\nl
Aerial statue of the nude Idea,\nl
Virgin conception of a bodiless god,\nl
Its light stirs man the thinker to create\nl
An earthly semblance of diviner things.\nl
Its hued reflection falls upon man's acts;\nl
His institutions are its cenotaphs,\nl
He signs his dead conventions with its name;\nl
His virtues don the Ideal's skiey robe\nl
And a nimbus of the outline of its face:\nl
He hides their littleness with the divine Name.\nl
Yet insufficient is the bright pretence\nl
To screen their indigent and earthy make:\nl
Earth only is there and not some heavenly source.\nl
If heavens there are they are veiled in their own light,\nl
If a Truth eternal somewhere reigns unknown,\nl
It burns in a tremendous void of God;\nl
For truth shines far from the falsehoods of the world;\nl
How can the heavens come down to unhappy earth\nl
Or the eternal lodge in drifting time?\nl
How shall the Ideal tread earth's dolorous soil\nl
Where life is only a labour and a hope,\nl
A child of Matter and by Matter fed,\nl
A fire flaming low in Nature's grate,\nl
A wave that breaks upon a shore in Time,\nl
A journey's toilsome trudge with death for goal?\nl
The Avatars have lived and died in vain,\nl
Vain was the sage's thought, the prophet's voice;\nl
Page 609

In vain is seen the shining upward Way.\nl
Earth lies unchanged beneath the circling sun;\nl
She loves her fall and no omnipotence\nl
Her mortal imperfections can erase,\nl
Force on man's crooked ignorance Heaven's straight line\nl
Or colonise a world of death with gods.\nl
O traveller in the chariot of the Sun,\nl
High priestess in thy holy fancy's shrine\nl
Who with a magic ritual in earth's house\nl
Worshippest ideal and eternal love,\nl
What is this love thy thought has deified,\nl
This sacred legend and immortal myth?\nl
It is a conscious yearning of thy flesh,\nl
It is a glorious burning of thy nerves,\nl
A rose of dream-splendour petalling thy mind,\nl
A great red rapture and torture of thy heart.\nl
A sudden transfiguration of thy days,\nl
It passes and the world is as before.\nl
A ravishing edge of sweetness and of pain,\nl
A thrill in its yearning makes it seem divine,\nl
A golden bridge across the roar of the years,\nl
A cord tying thee to eternity.\nl
And yet how brief and frail! how soon is spent\nl
This treasure wasted by the gods on man,\nl
This happy closeness as of soul to soul,\nl
This honey of the body's companionship,\nl
This heightened joy, this ecstasy in the veins,\nl
This strange illumination of the sense!\nl
If Satyavan had lived, love would have died;\nl
But Satyavan is dead and love shall live\nl
A little while in thy sad breast, until\nl
His face and body fade on memory's wall\nl
Where other bodies, other faces come.\nl
When love breaks suddenly into the life\nl
At first man steps into a world of the sun;\nl
In his passion he feels his heavenly element:\nl
Page 610

But only a fine sunlit patch of earth\nl
The marvellous aspect took of heaven's outburst;\nl
The snake is there and the worm in the heart of the rose.\nl
A word, a moment's act can slay the god;\nl
Precarious is his immortality,\nl
He has a thousand ways to suffer and die.\nl
Love cannot live by heavenly food alone,\nl
Only on sap of earth can it survive.\nl
For thy passion was a sensual want refined,\nl
A hunger of the body and the heart;\nl
Thy want can tire and cease or turn elsewhere.\nl
Or love may meet a dire and pitiless end\nl
By bitter treason, or wrath with cruel wounds\nl
Separate, or thy unsatisfied will to others\nl
Depart when first love's joy lies stripped and slain:\nl
A dull indifference replaces fire\nl
Or an endearing habit imitates love:\nl
An outward and uneasy union lasts\nl
Or the routine of a life's compromise:\nl
Where once the seed of oneness had been cast\nl
Into a semblance of spiritual ground\nl
By a divine adventure of heavenly powers\nl
Two strive, constant associates without joy,\nl
Two egos straining in a single leash,\nl
Two minds divided by their jarring thoughts,\nl
Two spirits disjoined, for ever separate.\nl
Thus is the ideal falsified in man's world;\nl
Trivial or sombre, disillusion comes,\nl
Life's harsh reality stares at the soul:\nl
Heaven's hour adjourned flees into bodiless Time.\nl
Death saves thee from this and saves Satyavan:\nl
He now is safe, delivered from himself;\nl
He travels to silence and felicity.\nl
Call him not back to the treacheries of earth\nl
And the poor petty life of animal Man.\nl
In my vast tranquil spaces let him sleep\nl
Page 611

In harmony with the mighty hush of death\nl
Where love lies slumbering on the breast of peace.\nl
And thou, go back alone to thy frail world:\nl
Chastise thy heart with knowledge, unhood to see,\nl
Thy nature raised into clear living heights,\nl
The heaven-bird's view from unimagined peaks.\nl
For when thou givest thy spirit to a dream\nl
Soon hard necessity will smite thee awake:\nl
Purest delight began and it must end.\nl
Thou too shalt know, thy heart no anchor swinging,\nl
Thy cradled soul moored in eternal seas.\nl
Vain are the cycles of thy brilliant mind.\nl
Renounce, forgetting joy and hope and tears,\nl
Thy passionate nature in the bosom profound\nl
Of a happy Nothingness and worldless Calm,\nl
Delivered into my mysterious rest.\nl
One with my fathomless Nihil all forget.\nl
Forget thy fruitless spirit's waste of force,\nl
Forget the weary circle of thy birth,\nl
Forget the joy and the struggle and the pain,\nl
The vague spiritual quest which first began\nl
When worlds broke forth like clusters of fire-flowers,\nl
And great burning thoughts voyaged through the sky of mind\nl
And Time and its aeons crawled across the vasts\nl
And souls emerged into mortality.”\nl
\sparn But Savitri replied to the dark Power:\nl
“A dangerous music now thou findst, O Death,\nl
Melting thy speech into harmonious pain,\nl
And flut'st alluringly to tired hopes\nl
Thy falsehoods mingled with sad strains of truth.\nl
But I forbid thy voice to slay my soul.\nl
My love is not a hunger of the heart,\nl
My love is not a craving of the flesh;\nl
It came to me from God, to God returns.\nl
Even in all that life and man have marred,\nl
A whisper of divinity still is heard,\nl
Page 612

A breath is felt from the eternal spheres.\nl
Allowed by Heaven and wonderful to man\nl
A sweet fire-rhythm of passion chants to love.\nl
There is a hope in its wild infinite cry;\nl
It rings with callings from forgotten heights,\nl
And when its strains are hushed to high-winged souls\nl
In their empyrean, its burning breath\nl
Survives beyond, the rapturous core of suns\nl
That flame for ever pure in skies unseen,\nl
A voice of the eternal Ecstasy.\nl
One day I shall behold my great sweet world\nl
Put off the dire disguises of the gods,\nl
Unveil from terror and disrobe from sin.\nl
Appeased we shall draw near our mother's face,\nl
We shall cast our candid souls upon her lap;\nl
Then shall we clasp the ecstasy we chase,\nl
Then shall we shudder with the long-sought god,\nl
Then shall we find Heaven's unexpected strain.\nl
Not only is there hope for godheads pure;\nl
The violent and darkened deities\nl
Leaped down from the one breast in rage to find\nl
What the white gods had missed: they too are safe;\nl
A mother's eyes are on them and her arms\nl
Stretched out in love desire her rebel sons.\nl
One who came love and lover and beloved\nl
Eternal, built himself a wondrous field\nl
And wove the measures of a marvellous dance.\nl
There in its circles and its magic turns\nl
Attracted he arrives, repelled he flees.\nl
In the wild devious promptings of his mind\nl
He tastes the honey of tears and puts off joy\nl
Repenting, and has laughter and has wrath,\nl
And both are a broken music of the soul\nl
Which seeks out reconciled its heavenly rhyme.\nl
Ever he comes to us across the years\nl
Bearing a new sweet face that is the old.\nl
Page 613

His bliss laughs to us or it calls concealed\nl
Like a far-heard unseen entrancing flute\nl
From moonlit branches in the throbbing woods,\nl
Tempting our angry search and passionate pain.\nl
Disguised the Lover seeks and draws our souls.\nl
He named himself for me, grew Satyavan.\nl
For we were man and woman from the first,\nl
The twin souls born from one undying fire.\nl
Did he not dawn on me in other stars?\nl
How has he through the thickets of the world\nl
Pursued me like a lion in the night\nl
And come upon me suddenly in the ways\nl
And seized me with his glorious golden leap!\nl
Unsatisfied he yearned for me through time,\nl
Sometimes with wrath and sometimes with sweet peace\nl
Desiring me since first the world began.\nl
He rose like a wild wave out of the floods\nl
And dragged me helpless into seas of bliss.\nl
Out of my curtained past his arms arrive;\nl
They have touched me like the soft persuading wind,\nl
They have plucked me like a glad and trembling flower,\nl
And clasped me happily burned in ruthless flame.\nl
I too have found him charmed in lovely forms\nl
And run delighted to his distant voice\nl
And pressed to him past many dreadful bars.\nl
If there is a yet happier greater god,\nl
Let him first wear the face of Satyavan\nl
And let his soul be one with him I love;\nl
So let him seek me that I may desire.\nl
For only one heart beats within my breast\nl
And one god sits there throned. Advance, O Death,\nl
Beyond the phantom beauty of this world;\nl
For of its citizens I am not one.\nl
I cherish God the Fire, not God the Dream.”\nl
But Death once more inflicted on her heart\nl
The majesty of his calm and dreadful voice:\nl
Page 614

“A bright hallucination are thy thoughts.\nl
A prisoner haled by a spiritual cord,\nl
Of thy own sensuous will the ardent slave,\nl
Thou sendest eagle-poised to meet the sun\nl
Words winged with the red splendour of thy heart.\nl
But knowledge dwells not in the passionate heart;\nl
The heart's words fall back unheard from Wisdom's throne.\nl
Vain is thy longing to build heaven on earth.\nl
Artificer of Ideal and Idea,\nl
Mind, child of Matter in the womb of Life,\nl
To higher levels persuades his parents' steps:\nl
Inapt, they follow ill the daring guide.\nl
But Mind, a glorious traveller in the sky,\nl
Walks lamely on the earth with footsteps slow;\nl
Hardly he can mould the life's rebellious stuff,\nl
Hardly can he hold the galloping hooves of sense:\nl
His thoughts look straight into the very heavens;\nl
They draw their gold from a celestial mine,\nl
His acts work painfully a common ore.\nl
All thy high dreams were made by Matter's mind\nl
To solace its dull work in Matter's jail,\nl
Its only house where it alone seems true.\nl
A solid image of reality\nl
Carved out of being to prop the works of Time,\nl
Matter on the firm earth sits strong and sure.\nl
It is the first-born of created things,\nl
It stands the last when mind and life are slain,\nl
And if it ended all would cease to be.\nl
All else is only its outcome or its phase:\nl
Thy soul is a brief flower by the gardener Mind\nl
Created in thy matter's terrain plot;\nl
It perishes with the plant on which it grows,\nl
For from earth's sap it draws its heavenly hue:\nl
Thy thoughts are gleams that pass on Matter's verge,\nl
Thy life a lapsing wave on Matter's sea.\nl
A careful steward of Truth's limited means,\nl
Page 615

Treasuring her founded facts from the squandering Power,\nl
It tethers mind to the tent-posts of sense,\nl
To a leaden grey routine clamps Life's caprice\nl
And ties all creatures with the cords of Law.\nl
A vessel of transmuting alchemies,\nl
A glue that sticks together mind and life,\nl
If Matter fails, all crumbling cracks and falls.\nl
All upon Matter stands as on a rock.\nl
Yet this security and guarantor\nl
Pressed for credentials an impostor proves:\nl
A cheat of substance where no substance is,\nl
An appearance and a symbol and a nought,\nl
Its forms have no original right to birth:\nl
Its aspect of a fixed stability\nl
Is the cover of a captive motion's swirl,\nl
An order of the steps of Energy's dance\nl
Whose footmarks leave for ever the same signs,\nl
A concrete face of unsubstantial Time,\nl
A trickle dotting the emptiness of Space:\nl
A stable-seeming movement without change,\nl
Yet change arrives and the last change is death.\nl
What seemed most real once, is Nihil's show.\nl
Its figures are snares that trap and prison the sense;\nl
The beginningless Void was its artificer:\nl
Nothing is there but aspects limned by Chance\nl
And seeming shapes of seeming Energy.\nl
All by Death's mercy breathe and live awhile,\nl
All think and act by the Inconscient's grace.\nl
Addict of the roseate luxury of thy thoughts,\nl
Turn not thy gaze within thyself to look\nl
At visions in the gleaming crystal, Mind,\nl
Close not thy lids to dream the forms of Gods.\nl
At last to open thy eyes consent and see\nl
The stuff of which thou and the world are made.\nl
Inconscient in the dumb inconscient Void\nl
Inexplicably a moving world sprang forth:\nl
Page 616

Awhile secure, happily insensible,\nl
It could not rest content with its own truth.\nl
For something on its nescient breast was born\nl
Condemned to see and know, to feel and love,\nl
It watched its acts, imagined a soul within;\nl
It groped for truth and dreamed of Self and God.\nl
When all unconscious was, then all was well.\nl
I, Death, was king and kept my regal state,\nl
Designing my unwilled, unerring plan,\nl
Creating with a calm insentient heart.\nl
In my sovereign power of unreality\nl
Obliging nothingness to take a form,\nl
Infallibly my blind unthinking force\nl
Making by chance a fixity like fate's,\nl
By whim the formulas of Necessity,\nl
Founded on the hollow ground of the Inane\nl
The sure bizarrerie of Nature's scheme.\nl
I curved the vacant ether into Space;\nl
A huge expanding and contracting Breath\nl
Harboured the fires of the universe:\nl
I struck out the supreme original spark\nl
And spread its sparse ranked armies through the Inane,\nl
Manufactured the stars from the occult radiances,\nl
Marshalled the platoons of the invisible dance;\nl
I formed earth's beauty out of atom and gas,\nl
And built from chemic plasm the living man.\nl
Then Thought came in and spoiled the harmonious world:\nl
Matter began to hope and think and feel,\nl
Tissue and nerve bore joy and agony.\nl
The inconscient cosmos strove to learn its task;\nl
An ignorant personal God was born in Mind\nl
And to understand invented reason's law,\nl
The impersonal Vast throbbed back to man's desire,\nl
A trouble rocked the great world's blind still heart\nl
And Nature lost her wide immortal calm.\nl
Thus came this warped incomprehensible scene\nl
Page 617

Of souls emmeshed in life's delight and pain\nl
And Matter's sleep and Mind's mortality,\nl
Of beings in Nature's prison waiting death\nl
And consciousness left in seeking ignorance\nl
And evolution's slow arrested plan.\nl
This is the world in which thou mov'st, astray\nl
In the tangled pathways of the human mind,\nl
In the issueless circling of thy human life,\nl
Searching for thy soul and thinking God is here.\nl
But where is room for soul or place for God\nl
In the brute immensity of a machine?\nl
A transient Breath thou takest for thy soul,\nl
Born from a gas, a plasm, a sperm, a gene,\nl
A magnified image of man's mind for God,\nl
A shadow of thyself thrown upon Space.\nl
Interposed between the upper and nether Void,\nl
Thy consciousness reflects the world around\nl
In the distorting mirror of Ignorance\nl
Or upwards turns to catch imagined stars.\nl
Or if a half-Truth is playing with the earth\nl
Throwing its light on a dark shadowy ground,\nl
It touches only and leaves a luminous smudge.\nl
Immortality thou claimest for thy spirit,\nl
But immortality for imperfect man,\nl
A god who hurts himself at every step,\nl
Would be a cycle of eternal pain.\nl
Wisdom and love thou claimest as thy right;\nl
But knowledge in this world is error's mate,\nl
A brilliant procuress of Nescience,\nl
And human love a posturer on earth-stage\nl
Who imitates with verve a faery dance.\nl
An extract pressed from hard experience,\nl
Man's knowledge casked in the barrels of Memory\nl
Has the harsh savour of a mortal draught:\nl
A sweet secretion from the erotic glands\nl
Flattering and torturing the burning nerves,\nl
Page 618

Love is a honey and poison in the breast\nl
Drunk by it as the nectar of the gods.\nl
Earth's human wisdom is no great-browed power,\nl
And love no gleaming angel from the skies;\nl
If they aspire beyond earth's dullard air,\nl
Arriving sunwards with frail waxen wings,\nl
How high could reach that forced unnatural flight?\nl
But not on earth can divine wisdom reign\nl
And not on earth can divine love be found;\nl
Heaven-born, only in heaven can they live;\nl
Or else there too perhaps they are shining dreams.\nl
Nay, is not all thou art and doest a dream?\nl
Thy mind and life are tricks of Matter's force.\nl
If thy mind seems to thee a radiant sun,\nl
If thy life runs a swift and glorious stream,\nl
This is the illusion of thy mortal heart\nl
Dazzled by a ray of happiness or light.\nl
Impotent to live by their own right divine,\nl
Convinced of their brilliant unreality,\nl
When their supporting ground is cut away,\nl
These children of Matter into Matter die.\nl
Even Matter vanishes into Energy's vague\nl
And Energy is a motion of old Nought.\nl
How shall the Ideal's unsubstantial hues\nl
Be painted stiff on earth's vermilion blur,\nl
A dream within a dream come doubly true?\nl
How shall the will-o'-the-wisp become a star?\nl
The Ideal is a malady of thy mind,\nl
A bright delirium of thy speech and thought,\nl
A strange wine of beauty lifting thee to false sight.\nl
A noble fiction of thy yearnings made,\nl
Thy human imperfection it must share:\nl
Its forms in Nature disappoint the heart,\nl
And never shall it find its heavenly shape\nl
And never can it be fulfilled in Time.\nl
O soul misled by the splendour of thy thoughts,\nl
Page 619

O earthly creature with thy dream of heaven,\nl
Obey, resigned and still, the earthly law.\nl
Accept the brief light that falls upon thy days;\nl
Take what thou canst of Life's permitted joy;\nl
Submitting to the ordeal of fate's scourge\nl
Suffer what thou must of toil and grief and care.\nl
There shall approach silencing thy passionate heart\nl
My long calm night of everlasting sleep:\nl
There into the hush from which thou cam'st retire.”\nl

\ht Canto Three: The Debate of Love and Death
\par
\sbigcap A sad destroying cadence the voice sank;\nl
It seemed to lead the advancing march of Life\nl
Into some still original Inane.\nl
But Savitri answered to almighty Death:\nl
“O dark-browed sophist of the universe\nl
Who veilst the Real with its own Idea,\nl
Hiding with brute objects Nature's living face,\nl
Masking eternity with thy dance of death,\nl
Thou hast woven the ignorant mind into a screen\nl
And made of Thought error's purveyor and scribe,\nl
And a false witness of mind's servant sense.\nl
An aesthete of the sorrow of the world,\nl
Champion of a harsh and sad philosophy\nl
Thou hast used words to shutter out the Light\nl
And called in Truth to vindicate a lie.\nl
A lying reality is falsehood's crown\nl
And a perverted truth her richest gem.\nl
O Death, thou speakest truth but truth that slays,\nl
I answer to thee with the Truth that saves.\nl
A traveller new-discovering himself,\nl
One made of Matter's world his starting-point,\nl
He made of Nothingness his living-room\nl
And Night a process of the eternal light\nl
And death a spur towards immortality.\nl
God wrapped his head from sight in Matter's cowl,\nl
His consciousness dived into inconscient depths,\nl
All-Knowledge seemed a huge dark Nescience;\nl
Infinity wore a boundless zero's form.\nl
His abysms of bliss became insensible deeps,\nl
Eternity a blank spiritual Vast.\nl
Annulling an original nullity\nl
Page 621

The Timeless took its ground in emptiness\nl
And drew the figure of a universe,\nl
That the spirit might adventure into Time\nl
And wrestle with adamant Necessity\nl
And the soul pursue a cosmic pilgrimage.\nl
A spirit moved in black immensities\nl
And built a Thought in ancient Nothingness;\nl
A soul was lit in God's tremendous Void,\nl
A secret labouring glow of nascent fire.\nl
In Nihil's gulf his mighty Puissance wrought;\nl
She swung her formless motion into shapes,\nl
Made Matter the body of the Bodiless.\nl
Infant and dim the eternal Mights awoke.\nl
In inert Matter breathed a slumbering Life,\nl
In a subconscient Life Mind lay asleep;\nl
In waking Life it stretched its giant limbs\nl
To shake from it the torpor of its drowse;\nl
A senseless substance quivered into sense,\nl
The world's heart commenced to beat, its eyes to see,\nl
In the crowded dumb vibrations of a brain\nl
Thought fumbled in a ring to find itself,\nl
Discovered speech and fed the new-born Word\nl
That bridged with spans of light the world's ignorance.\nl
In waking Mind, the Thinker built his house.\nl
A reasoning animal willed and planned and sought;\nl
He stood erect among his brute compeers,\nl
He built life new, measured the universe,\nl
Opposed his fate and wrestled with unseen Powers,\nl
Conquered and used the laws that rule the world,\nl
And hoped to ride the heavens and reach the stars,\nl
A master of his huge environment.\nl
Now through Mind's windows stares the demigod\nl
Hidden behind the curtains of man's soul:\nl
He has seen the Unknown, looked on Truth's veilless face;\nl
A ray has touched him from the eternal sun;\nl
Motionless, voiceless in foreseeing depths,\nl
Page 622

He stands awake in Supernature's light\nl
And sees a glory of arisen wings\nl
And sees the vast descending might of God.\nl
\sparn “O Death, thou lookst on an unfinished world\nl
Assailed by thee and of its road unsure,\nl
Peopled by imperfect minds and ignorant lives,\nl
And sayest God is not and all is vain.\nl
How shall the child already be the man?\nl
Because he is infant, shall he never grow?\nl
Because he is ignorant, shall he never learn?\nl
In a small fragile seed a great tree lurks,\nl
In a tiny gene a thinking being is shut;\nl
A little element in a little sperm,\nl
It grows and is a conqueror and a sage.\nl
Then wilt thou spew out, Death, God's mystic truth,\nl
Deny the occult spiritual miracle?\nl
Still wilt thou say there is no spirit, no God?\nl
A mute material Nature wakes and sees;\nl
She has invented speech, unveiled a will.\nl
Something there waits beyond towards which she strives,\nl
Something surrounds her into which she grows:\nl
To uncover the spirit, to change back into God,\nl
To exceed herself is her transcendent task.\nl
In God concealed the world began to be,\nl
Tardily it travels towards manifest God:\nl
Our imperfection towards perfection toils,\nl
The body is the chrysalis of a soul:\nl
The infinite holds the finite in its arms,\nl
Time travels towards revealed eternity.\nl
A miracle structure of the eternal Mage,\nl
Matter its mystery hides from its own eyes,\nl
A scripture written out in cryptic signs,\nl
An occult document of the All-Wonderful's art.\nl
All here bears witness to his secret might,\nl
In all we feel his presence and his power.\nl
A blaze of his sovereign glory is the sun,\nl
Page 623

A glory is the gold and glimmering moon,\nl
A glory is his dream of purple sky.\nl
A march of his greatness are the wheeling stars.\nl
His laughter of beauty breaks out in green trees,\nl
His moments of beauty triumph in a flower;\nl
The blue sea's chant, the rivulet's wandering voice\nl
Are murmurs falling from the Eternal's harp.\nl
This world is God fulfilled in outwardness.\nl
His ways challenge our reason and our sense;\nl
By blind brute movements of an ignorant Force,\nl
By means we slight as small, obscure or base,\nl
A greatness founded upon little things,\nl
He has built a world in the unknowing Void.\nl
His forms he has massed from infinitesimal dust;\nl
His marvels are built from insignificant things.\nl
If mind is crippled, life untaught and crude,\nl
If brutal masks are there and evil acts,\nl
They are incidents of his vast and varied plot,\nl
His great and dangerous drama's needed steps;\nl
He makes with these and all his passion-play,\nl
A play and yet no play but the deep scheme\nl
Of a transcendent Wisdom finding ways\nl
To meet her Lord in the shadow and the Night:\nl
Above her is the vigil of the stars;\nl
Watched by a solitary Infinitude\nl
She embodies in dumb Matter the Divine,\nl
In symbol minds and lives the Absolute.\nl
A miracle-monger her mechanical craft;\nl
Matter's machine worked out the laws of thought,\nl
Life's engines served the labour of a soul:\nl
The Mighty Mother her creation wrought,\nl
A huge caprice self-bound by iron laws,\nl
And shut God into an enigmatic world:\nl
She lulled the Omniscient into nescient sleep,\nl
Omnipotence on Inertia's back she drove,\nl
Trod perfectly with divine unconscious steps\nl
Page 624

The enormous circle of her wonder-works.\nl
Immortality assured itself by death;\nl
The Eternal's face was seen through drifts of Time.\nl
His knowledge he disguised as Ignorance,\nl
His Good he sowed in Evil's monstrous bed,\nl
Made error a door by which Truth could enter in,\nl
His plant of bliss watered with Sorrow's tears.\nl
A thousand aspects point back to the One;\nl
A dual Nature covered the Unique.\nl
In this meeting of the Eternal's mingling masques,\nl
This tangle-dance of passionate contraries\nl
Locking like lovers in a forbidden embrace\nl
The quarrel of their lost identity,\nl
Through this wrestle and wrangle of the extremes of Power\nl
Earth's million roads struggled towards deity.\nl
All stumbled on behind a stumbling Guide,\nl
Yet every stumble is a needed pace\nl
On unknown routes to an unknowable goal.\nl
All blundered and straggled towards the One Divine.\nl
As if transmuted by a titan spell\nl
The eternal Powers assumed a dubious face:\nl
Idols of an oblique divinity,\nl
They wore the heads of animal or troll,\nl
Assumed ears of the faun, the satyr's hoof,\nl
Or harboured the demoniac in their gaze:\nl
A crooked maze they made of thinking mind,\nl
They suffered a metamorphosis of the heart,\nl
Admitting bacchant revellers from the Night\nl
Into its sanctuary of delights,\nl
As in a Dionysian masquerade.\nl
On the highways, in the gardens of the world\nl
They wallowed oblivious of their divine parts,\nl
As drunkards of a dire Circean wine\nl
Or a child who sprawls and sports in Nature's mire.\nl
Even wisdom, hewer of the roads of God,\nl
Is a partner in the deep disastrous game:\nl
Page 625

Lost is the pilgrim's wallet and the scrip,\nl
She fails to read the map and watch the star.\nl
A poor self-righteous virtue is her stock\nl
And reason's pragmatic grope or abstract sight,\nl
Or the technique of a brief hour's success\nl
She teaches, an usher in utility's school.\nl
On the ocean surface of vast Consciousness\nl
Small thoughts in shoals are fished up into a net\nl
But the great truths escape her narrow cast;\nl
Guarded from vision by creation's depths,\nl
Obscure they swim in blind enormous gulfs\nl
Safe from the little sounding leads of mind,\nl
Too far for the puny diver's shallow plunge.\nl
Our mortal vision peers with ignorant eyes;\nl
It has no gaze on the deep heart of things.\nl
Our knowledge walks leaning on Error's staff,\nl
A worshipper of false dogmas and false gods,\nl
Or fanatic of a fierce intolerant creed\nl
Or a seeker doubting every truth he finds,\nl
A sceptic facing Light with adamant No\nl
Or chilling the heart with dry ironic smile,\nl
A cynic stamping out the god in man;\nl
A darkness wallows in the paths of Time\nl
Or lifts its giant head to blot the stars;\nl
It makes a cloud of the interpreting mind\nl
And intercepts the oracles of the Sun.\nl
Yet Light is there; it stands at Nature's doors:\nl
It holds a torch to lead the traveller in.\nl
It waits to be kindled in our secret cells;\nl
It is a star lighting an ignorant sea,\nl
A lamp upon our poop piercing the night.\nl
As knowledge grows Light flames up from within:\nl
It is a shining warrior in the mind,\nl
An eagle of dreams in the divining heart,\nl
An armour in the fight, a bow of God.\nl
Then larger dawns arrive and Wisdom's pomps\nl
Page 626

Cross through the being's dim half-lighted fields;\nl
Philosophy climbs up Thought's cloud-bank peaks\nl
And Science tears out Nature's occult powers,\nl
Enormous djinns who serve a dwarf's small needs,\nl
Exposes the sealed minutiae of her art\nl
And conquers her by her own captive force.\nl
On heights unreached by mind's most daring soar,\nl
Upon a dangerous edge of failing Time\nl
The soul draws back into its deathless Self;\nl
Man's knowledge becomes God's supernal Ray.\nl
There is the mystic realm whence leaps the power\nl
Whose fire burns in the eyes of seer and sage;\nl
A lightning flash of visionary sight,\nl
It plays upon an inward verge of mind:\nl
Thought silenced gazes into a brilliant Void.\nl
A voice comes down from mystic unseen peaks:\nl
A cry of splendour from a mouth of storm,\nl
It is the voice that speaks to night's profound,\nl
It is the thunder and the flaming call.\nl
Above the planes that climb from nescient earth,\nl
A hand is lifted towards the Invisible's realm,\nl
Beyond the superconscient's blinding line\nl
And plucks away the screens of the Unknown;\nl
A spirit within looks into the Eternal's eyes.\nl
It hears the Word to which our hearts were deaf,\nl
It sees through the blaze in which our thoughts grew blind;\nl
It drinks from the naked breasts of glorious Truth,\nl
It learns the secrets of eternity.\nl
Thus all was plunged into the riddling Night,\nl
Thus all is raised to meet a dazzling Sun.\nl
O Death, this is the mystery of thy reign.\nl
In earth's anomalous and magic field\nl
Carried in its aimless journey by the sun\nl
Mid the forced marches of the great dumb stars,\nl
A darkness occupied the fields of God,\nl
And Matter's world was governed by thy shape.\nl
Page 627

Thy mask has covered the Eternal's face,\nl
The Bliss that made the world has fallen asleep.\nl
Abandoned in the Vast she slumbered on:\nl
An evil transmutation overtook\nl
Her members till she knew herself no more.\nl
Only through her creative slumber flit\nl
Frail memories of the joy and beauty meant\nl
Under the sky's blue laugh mid green-scarfed trees\nl
And happy squanderings of scents and hues,\nl
In the field of the golden promenade of the sun\nl
And the vigil of the dream-light of the stars,\nl
Amid high meditating heads of hills,\nl
On the bosom of voluptuous rain-kissed earth\nl
And by the sapphire tumblings of the sea.\nl
But now the primal innocence is lost\nl
And Death and Ignorance govern the mortal world\nl
And Nature's visage wears a greyer hue.\nl
Earth still has kept her early charm and grace,\nl
The grandeur and the beauty still are hers,\nl
But veiled is the divine Inhabitant.\nl
The souls of men have wandered from the Light\nl
And the great Mother turns away her face.\nl
The eyes of the creatrix Bliss are closed\nl
And sorrow's touch has found her in her dreams.\nl
As she turns and tosses on her bed of Void,\nl
Because she cannot wake and find herself\nl
And cannot build again her perfect shape,\nl
Oblivious of her nature and her state,\nl
Forgetting her instinct of felicity,\nl
Forgetting to create a world of joy,\nl
She weeps and makes her creatures' eyes to weep;\nl
Testing with sorrow's edge her children's breasts,\nl
She spends on life's vain waste of hope and toil\nl
The poignant luxury of grief and tears.\nl
In the nightmare change of her half-conscious dream,\nl
Tortured herself and torturing by her touch,\nl
Page 628

She comes to our hearts and bodies and our lives\nl
Wearing a hard and cruel mask of pain.\nl
Our nature twisted by the abortive birth\nl
Returns wry answers to life's questioning shocks,\nl
An acrid relish finds in the world's pangs,\nl
Drinks the sharp wine of grief's perversity.\nl
A curse is laid on the pure joy of life:\nl
Delight, God's sweetest sign and Beauty's twin,\nl
Dreaded by aspiring saint and austere sage,\nl
Is shunned, a dangerous and ambiguous cheat,\nl
A specious trick of an infernal Power\nl
It tempts the soul to its self-hurt and fall.\nl
A puritan God made pleasure a poisonous fruit,\nl
Or red drug in the market-place of Death,\nl
And sin the child of Nature's ecstasy.\nl
Yet every creature hunts for happiness,\nl
Buys with harsh pangs or tears by violence\nl
From the dull breast of the inanimate globe\nl
Some fragment or some broken shard of bliss.\nl
Even joy itself becomes a poisonous draught;\nl
Its hunger is made a dreadful hook of Fate.\nl
All means are held good to catch a single beam,\nl
Eternity sacrificed for a moment's bliss:\nl
Yet for joy and not for sorrow earth was made\nl
And not as a dream in endless suffering Time.\nl
Although God made the world for his delight,\nl
An ignorant Power took charge and seemed his Will\nl
And Death's deep falsity has mastered Life.\nl
All grew a play of Chance simulating Fate.\nl

\spar “A secret air of pure felicity\nl
Deep like a sapphire heaven our spirits breathe;\nl
Our hearts and bodies feel its obscure call,\nl
Our senses grope for it and touch and lose.\nl
If this withdrew, the world would sink in the Void;\nl
If this were not, nothing could move or live.\nl
Page 629

A hidden Bliss is at the root of things.\nl
A mute Delight regards Time's countless works:\nl
To house God's joy in things Space gave wide room,\nl
To house God's joy in self our souls were born.\nl
This universe an old enchantment guards;\nl
Its objects are carved cups of World-Delight\nl
Whose charmed wine is some deep soul's rapture-drink:\nl
The All-Wonderful has packed heaven with his dreams,\nl
He has made blank ancient Space his marvel-house;\nl
He spilled his spirit into Matter's signs:\nl
His fires of grandeur burn in the great sun,\nl
He glides through heaven shimmering in the moon;\nl
He is beauty carolling in the fields of sound;\nl
He chants the stanzas of the odes of Wind;\nl
He is silence watching in the stars at night;\nl
He wakes at dawn and calls from every bough,\nl
Lies stunned in the stone and dreams in flower and tree.\nl
Even in this labour and dolour of Ignorance,\nl
On the hard perilous ground of difficult earth,\nl
In spite of death and evil circumstance\nl
A will to live persists, a joy to be.\nl
There is a joy in all that meets the sense,\nl
A joy in all experience of the soul,\nl
A joy in evil and a joy in good,\nl
A joy in virtue and a joy in sin:\nl
Indifferent to the threat of Karmic law,\nl
Joy dares to grow upon forbidden soil,\nl
Its sap runs through the plant and flowers of Pain:\nl
It thrills with the drama of fate and tragic doom,\nl
It tears its food from sorrow and ecstasy,\nl
On danger and difficulty whets its strength;\nl
It wallows with the reptile and the worm\nl
And lifts its head, an equal of the stars;\nl
It shares the faeries' dance, dines with the gnome:\nl
It basks in the light and heat of many suns,\nl
The sun of Beauty and the sun of Power\nl
Page 630

Flatter and foster it with golden beams;\nl
It grows towards the Titan and the God.\nl
On earth it lingers drinking its deep fill,\nl
Through the symbol of her pleasure and her pain,\nl
Of the grapes of Heaven and the flowers of the Abyss,\nl
Of the flame-stabs and the torment-craft of Hell\nl
And dim fragments of the glory of Paradise.\nl
In the small paltry pleasures of man's life,\nl
In his petty passions and joys it finds a taste,\nl
A taste in tears and torture of broken hearts,\nl
In the crown of gold and in the crown of thorns,\nl
In life's nectar of sweetness and its bitter wine.\nl
All being it explores for unknown bliss,\nl
Sounds all experience for things new and strange.\nl
Life brings into the earthly creature's days\nl
A tongue of glory from a brighter sphere:\nl
It deepens in his musings and his Art,\nl
It leaps at the splendour of some perfect word,\nl
It exults in his high resolves and noble deeds,\nl
Wanders in his errors, dares the abyss's brink,\nl
It climbs in his climbings, wallows in his fall.\nl
Angel and demon brides his chamber share,\nl
Possessors or competitors for life's heart.\nl
To the enjoyer of the cosmic scene\nl
His greatness and his littleness equal are,\nl
His magnanimity and meanness hues\nl
Cast on some neutral background of the gods:\nl
The Artist's skill he admires who planned it all.\nl
But not for ever endures this danger game:\nl
Beyond the earth, but meant for delivered earth,\nl
Wisdom and joy prepare their perfect crown;\nl
Truth superhuman calls to thinking man.\nl
At last the soul turns to eternal things,\nl
In every shrine it cries for the clasp of God.\nl
Then is there played the crowning Mystery,\nl
Then is achieved the longed-for miracle.\nl
Page 631

Immortal Bliss her wide celestial eyes\nl
Opens on the stars, she stirs her mighty limbs;\nl
Time thrills to the sapphics of her amour-song\nl
And Space fills with a white beatitude.\nl
Then leaving to its grief the human heart,\nl
Abandoning speech and the name-determined realms,\nl
Through a gleaming far-seen sky of wordless thought,\nl
Through naked thought-free heavens of absolute sight,\nl
She climbs to the summits where the unborn Idea\nl
Remembering the future that must be\nl
Looks down upon the works of labouring Force,\nl
Immutable above the world it made.\nl
In the vast golden laughter of Truth's sun\nl
Like a great heaven-bird on a motionless sea\nl
Is poised her winged ardour of creative joy\nl
On the still deep of the Eternal's peace.\nl
This was the aim, this the supernal Law,\nl
Nature's allotted task when beauty-drenched\nl
In dim mist-waters of inconscient sleep,\nl
Out of the Void this grand creation rose,—\nl
For this the Spirit came into the Abyss\nl
And charged with its power Matter's unknowing force,\nl
In Night's bare session to cathedral Light,\nl
In Death's realm repatriate immortality.\nl
A mystic slow transfiguration works.\nl
All our earth starts from mud and ends in sky,\nl
And Love that was once an animal's desire,\nl
Then a sweet madness in the rapturous heart,\nl
An ardent comradeship in the happy mind,\nl
Becomes a wide spiritual yearning's space.\nl
A lonely soul passions for the Alone,\nl
The heart that loved man thrills to the love of God,\nl
A body is his chamber and his shrine.\nl
Then is our being rescued from separateness;\nl
All is itself, all is new-felt in God:\nl
A Lover leaning from his cloister's door\nl
Page 632

Gathers the whole world into his single breast.\nl
Then shall the business fail of Night and Death:\nl
When unity is won, when strife is lost\nl
And all is known and all is clasped by Love\nl
Who would turn back to ignorance and pain?\nl
\sparn “O Death, I have triumphed over thee within;\nl
I quiver no more with the assault of grief;\nl
A mighty calmness seated deep within\nl
Has occupied my body and my sense:\nl
It takes the world's grief and transmutes to strength,\nl
It makes the world's joy one with the joy of God.\nl
My love eternal sits throned on God's calm;\nl
For Love must soar beyond the very heavens\nl
And find its secret sense ineffable;\nl
It must change its human ways to ways divine,\nl
Yet keep its sovereignty of earthly bliss.\nl
O Death, not for my heart's sweet poignancy\nl
Nor for my happy body's bliss alone\nl
I have claimed from thee the living Satyavan,\nl
But for his work and mine, our sacred charge.\nl
Our lives are God's messengers beneath the stars;\nl
To dwell under death's shadow they have come\nl
Tempting God's light to earth for the ignorant race,\nl
His love to fill the hollow in men's hearts,\nl
His bliss to heal the unhappiness of the world.\nl
For I, the woman, am the force of God,\nl
He the Eternal's delegate soul in man.\nl
My will is greater than thy law, O Death;\nl
My love is stronger than the bonds of Fate:\nl
Our love is the heavenly seal of the Supreme.\nl
I guard that seal against thy rending hands.\nl
Love must not cease to live upon the earth;\nl
For Love is the bright link twixt earth and heaven,\nl
Love is the far Transcendent's angel here;\nl
Love is man's lien on the Absolute.”\nl
But to the woman Death the god replied,\nl
Page 633

With the ironic laughter of his voice\nl
Discouraging the labour of the stars:\nl
“Even so men cheat the Truth with splendid thoughts.\nl
Thus wilt thou hire the glorious charlatan, Mind,\nl
To weave from his Ideal's gossamer air\nl
A fine raiment for thy body's nude desires\nl
And thy heart's clutching greedy passion clothe?\nl
Daub not the web of life with magic hues:\nl
Make rather thy thought a plain and faithful glass\nl
Reflecting Matter and mortality,\nl
And know thy soul a product of the flesh,\nl
A made-up self in a constructed world.\nl
Thy words are large murmurs in a mystic dream.\nl
For how in the soiled heart of man could dwell\nl
The immaculate grandeur of thy dream-built God,\nl
Or who can see a face and form divine\nl
In the naked two-legged worm thou callest man?\nl
O human face, put off mind-painted masks:\nl
The animal be, the worm that Nature meant;\nl
Accept thy futile birth, thy narrow life.\nl
For truth is bare like stone and hard like death;\nl
Bare in the bareness, hard with truth's hardness live.”\nl
But Savitri replied to the dire God:\nl
“Yes, I am human. Yet shall man by me,\nl
Since in humanity waits his hour the God,\nl
Trample thee down to reach the immortal heights,\nl
Transcending grief and pain and fate and death.\nl
Yes, my humanity is a mask of God:\nl
He dwells in me, the mover of my acts,\nl
Turning the great wheel of his cosmic work.\nl
I am the living body of his light,\nl
I am the thinking instrument of his power,\nl
I incarnate Wisdom in an earthly breast,\nl
I am his conquering and unslayable will.\nl
The formless Spirit drew in me its shape;\nl
In me are the Nameless and the secret Name.”\nl
Page 634

Death from the incredulous Darkness sent its cry:\nl
“O priestess in Imagination's house,\nl
Persuade first Nature's fixed immutable laws\nl
And make the impossible thy daily work.\nl
How canst thou force to wed two eternal foes?\nl
Irreconcilable in their embrace\nl
They cancel the glory of their pure extremes:\nl
An unhappy wedlock maims their stunted force.\nl
How shall thy will make one the true and false?\nl
Where Matter is all, there Spirit is a dream:\nl
If all are the Spirit, Matter is a lie,\nl
And who was the liar who forged the universe?\nl
The Real with the unreal cannot mate.\nl
He who would turn to God, must leave the world;\nl
He who would live in the Spirit, must give up life;\nl
He who has met the Self, renounces self.\nl
The voyagers of the million routes of mind\nl
Who have travelled through Existence to its end,\nl
Sages exploring the world-ocean's vasts,\nl
Have found extinction the sole harbour safe.\nl
Two only are the doors of man's escape,\nl
Death of his body Matter's gate to peace,\nl
Death of his soul his last felicity.\nl
In me all take refuge, for I, Death, am God.”\nl
But Savitri replied to mighty Death:\nl
“My heart is wiser than the Reason's thoughts,\nl
My heart is stronger than thy bonds, O Death.\nl
It sees and feels the one Heart beat in all,\nl
It feels the high Transcendent's sunlike hands,\nl
It sees the cosmic Spirit at its work;\nl
In the dim Night it lies alone with God.\nl
My heart's strength can carry the grief of the universe\nl
And never falter from its luminous track,\nl
Its white tremendous orbit through God's peace.\nl
It can drink up the sea of All-Delight\nl
And never lose the white spiritual touch,\nl
Page 635

The calm that broods in the deep Infinite.”\nl
He said, “Art thou indeed so strong, O heart,\nl
O soul, so free? And canst thou gather then\nl
Bright pleasure from my wayside flowering boughs,\nl
Yet falter not from thy hard journey's goal,\nl
Meet the world's dangerous touch and never fall?\nl
Show me thy strength and freedom from my laws.”\nl
But Savitri answered, “Surely I shall find\nl
Among the green and whispering woods of Life\nl
Close-bosomed pleasures, only mine since his,\nl
Or mine for him, because our joys are one.\nl
And if I linger, Time is ours and God's,\nl
And if I fall, is not his hand near mine?\nl
All is a single plan; each wayside act\nl
Deepens the soul's response, brings nearer the goal.”\nl
Death the contemptuous Nihil answered her:\nl
“So prove thy absolute force to the wise gods,\nl
By choosing earthly joy! For self demand\nl
And yet from self and its gross masks live free.\nl
Then will I give thee all thy soul desires,\nl
All the brief joys earth keeps for mortal hearts.\nl
Only the one dearest wish that outweighs all,\nl
Hard laws forbid and thy ironic fate.\nl
My will once wrought remains unchanged through Time,\nl
And Satyavan can never again be thine.”\nl
But Savitri replied to the vague Power:\nl
“If the eyes of Darkness can look straight at Truth,\nl
Look in my heart and, knowing what I am,\nl
Give what thou wilt or what thou must, O Death.\nl
Nothing I claim but Satyavan alone.”\nl
There was a hush as if of doubtful fates.\nl
As one disdainful still who yields a point\nl
Death bowed his sovereign head in cold assent:\nl
“I give to thee, saved from death and poignant fate\nl
Whatever once the living Satyavan\nl
Desired in his heart for Savitri.\nl
Page 636

Bright noons I give thee and unwounded dawns,\nl
Daughters of thy own shape in heart and mind,\nl
Fair hero sons and sweetness undisturbed\nl
Of union with thy husband dear and true.\nl
And thou shalt harvest in thy joyful house\nl
Felicity of thy surrounded eves.\nl
Love shall bind by thee many gathered hearts.\nl
The opposite sweetness in thy days shall meet\nl
Of tender service to thy life's desired\nl
And loving empire over all thy loved,\nl
Two poles of bliss made one, O Savitri.\nl
Return, O child, to thy forsaken earth.”\nl
But Savitri replied, “Thy gifts resist.\nl
Earth cannot flower if lonely I return.”\nl
Then Death sent forth once more his angry cry,\nl
As chides a lion his escaping prey:\nl
“What knowst thou of earth's rich and changing life\nl
Who thinkst that one man dead all joy must cease?\nl
Hope not to be unhappy till the end:\nl
For grief dies soon in the tired human heart;\nl
Soon other guests the empty chambers fill.\nl
A transient painting on a holiday's floor\nl
Traced for a moment's beauty love was made.\nl
Or if a voyager on the eternal trail,\nl
Its objects fluent change in its embrace\nl
Like waves to a swimmer upon infinite seas.”\nl
But Savitri replied to the vague god,\nl
“Give me back Satyavan, my only lord.\nl
Thy thoughts are vacant to my soul that feels\nl
The deep eternal truth in transient things.”\nl
Death answered her, “Return and try thy soul!\nl
Soon shalt thou find appeased that other men\nl
On lavish earth have beauty, strength and truth,\nl
And when thou hast half forgotten, one of these\nl
Shall wind himself around thy heart that needs\nl
Some human answering heart against thy breast;\nl
Page 637

For who, being mortal, can dwell glad alone?\nl
Then Satyavan shall glide into the past,\nl
A gentle memory pushed away from thee\nl
By new love and thy children's tender hands,\nl
Till thou shalt wonder if thou lov'dst at all.\nl
Such is the life earth's travail has conceived,\nl
A constant stream that never is the same.”\nl
But Savitri replied to mighty Death:\nl
“O dark ironic critic of God's work,\nl
Thou mockst the mind and body's faltering search\nl
For what the heart holds in a prophet hour\nl
And the immortal spirit shall make its own.\nl
Mine is a heart that worshipped, though forsaken,\nl
The image of the god its love adored;\nl
I have burned in flame to travel in his steps.\nl
Are we not they who bore vast solitude\nl
Seated upon the hills alone with God?\nl
Why dost thou vainly strive with me, O Death,\nl
A mind delivered from all twilight thoughts,\nl
To whom the secrets of the gods are plain?\nl
For now at last I know beyond all doubt,\nl
The great stars burn with my unceasing fire\nl
And life and death are both its fuel made.\nl
Life only was my blind attempt to love:\nl
Earth saw my struggle, heaven my victory;\nl
All shall be seized, transcended; there shall kiss\nl
Casting their veils before the marriage fire\nl
The eternal bridegroom and eternal bride.\nl
The heavens accept our broken flights at last.\nl
On our life's prow that breaks the waves of Time\nl
No signal light of hope has gleamed in vain.”\nl
She spoke; the boundless members of the god\nl
As if by secret ecstasy assailed,\nl
Shuddered in silence as obscurely stir\nl
Ocean's dim fields delivered to the moon.\nl
Then lifted up as by a sudden wind\nl
Page 638

Around her in that vague and glimmering world\nl
The twilight trembled like a bursting veil.\nl
\sparn Thus with armed speech the great opponents strove.\nl
Around those spirits in the glittering mist\nl
A deepening half-light fled with pearly wings\nl
As if to reach some far ideal Morn.\nl
Outlined her thoughts flew through the gleaming haze\nl
Mingling bright-pinioned with its lights and veils\nl
And all her words like dazzling jewels were caught\nl
Into the glow of a mysterious world,\nl
Or tricked in the rainbow shifting of its hues\nl
Like echoes swam fainting into far sound.\nl
All utterance, all mood must there become\nl
An unenduring tissue sewn by mind\nl
To make a gossamer robe of beautiful change.\nl
Intent upon her silent will she walked\nl
On the dim grass of vague unreal plains,\nl
A floating veil of visions in her front,\nl
A trailing robe of dreams behind her feet.\nl
But now her spirit's flame of conscient force\nl
Retiring from a sweetness without fruit\nl
Called back her thoughts from speech to sit within\nl
In a deep room in meditation's house.\nl
For only there could dwell the soul's firm truth:\nl
Imperishable, a tongue of sacrifice,\nl
It flamed unquenched upon the central hearth\nl
Where burns for the high houselord and his mate\nl
The homestead's sentinel and witness fire\nl
From which the altars of the gods are lit.\nl
All still compelled went gliding on unchanged,\nl
Still was the order of these worlds reversed:\nl
The mortal led, the god and spirit obeyed\nl
And she behind was leader of their march\nl
And they in front were followers of her will.\nl
Onward they journeyed through the drifting ways\nl
Vaguely companioned by the glimmering mists.\nl
Page 639

But faster now all fled as if perturbed\nl
Escaping from the clearness of her soul.\nl
A heaven-bird upon jewelled wings of wind\nl
Borne like a coloured and embosomed fire,\nl
By spirits carried in a pearl-hued cave,\nl
On through the enchanted dimness moved her soul.\nl
Death walked in front of her and Satyavan,\nl
In the dark front of Death, a failing star.\nl
Above was the unseen balance of his fate.\nl

\ht Canto Four: The Dream Twilight of the Earthly Real
\par
\sbigcap There came a slope that slowly downward sank;\nl
It slipped towards a stumbling grey descent.\nl
The dim-heart marvel of the ideal was lost;\nl
Its crowding wonder of bright delicate dreams\nl
And vague half-limned sublimities she had left:\nl
Thought fell towards lower levels; hard and tense\nl
It passioned for some crude reality.\nl
The twilight floated still but changed its hues\nl
And heavily swathed a less delightful dream;\nl
It settled in tired masses on the air;\nl
Its symbol colours tuned with duller reds\nl
And almost seemed a lurid mist of day.\nl
A straining taut and dire besieged her heart;\nl
Heavy her sense grew with a dangerous load,\nl
And sadder, greater sounds were in her ears,\nl
And through stern breakings of the lambent glare\nl
Her vision caught a hurry of driving plains\nl
And cloudy mountains and wide tawny streams,\nl
And cities climbed in minarets and towers\nl
Towards an unavailing changeless sky:\nl
Long quays and ghauts and harbours white with sails\nl
Challenged her sight awhile and then were gone.\nl
Amidst them travailed toiling multitudes\nl
In ever shifting perishable groups,\nl
A foiled cinema of lit shadowy shapes\nl
Enveloped in the grey mantle of a dream.\nl
Imagining meanings in life's heavy drift,\nl
They trusted in the uncertain environment\nl
And waited for death to change their spirit's scene.\nl
A savage din of labour and a tramp\nl
Of armoured life and the monotonous hum\nl
Page 641

Of thoughts and acts that ever were the same,\nl
As if the dull reiterated drone\nl
Of a great brute machine, beset her soul,—\nl
A grey dissatisfied rumour like a ghost\nl
Of the moaning of a loud unquiet sea.\nl
A huge inhuman cyclopean voice,\nl
A Babel-builders' song towering to heaven,\nl
A throb of engines and the clang of tools\nl
Brought the deep undertone of labour's pain.\nl
As when pale lightnings tear a tortured sky,\nl
High overhead a cloud-rimmed series flared\nl
Chasing like smoke from a red funnel driven,\nl
The forced creations of an ignorant Mind:\nl
Drifting she saw like pictured fragments flee\nl
Phantoms of human thought and baffled hopes,\nl
The shapes of Nature and the arts of man,\nl
Philosophies and disciplines and laws,\nl
And the dead spirit of old societies,\nl
Constructions of the Titan and the worm.\nl
As if lost remnants of forgotten light,\nl
Before her mind there fled with trailing wings\nl
Dimmed revelations and delivering words,\nl
Emptied of their mission and their strength to save,\nl
The messages of the evangelist gods,\nl
Voices of prophets, scripts of vanishing creeds.\nl
Each in its hour eternal claimed went by:\nl
Ideals, systems, sciences, poems, crafts\nl
Tireless there perished and again recurred,\nl
Sought restlessly by some creative Power;\nl
But all were dreams crossing an empty vast.\nl
Ascetic voices called of lonely seers\nl
On mountain summits or by river banks\nl
Or from the desolate heart of forest glades\nl
Seeking heaven's rest or the spirit's worldless peace,\nl
Or in bodies motionless like statues, fixed\nl
In tranced cessations of their sleepless thought\nl
Page 642

Sat sleeping souls, and this too was a dream.\nl
All things the past has made and slain were there,\nl
Its lost forgotten forms that once had lived,\nl
And all the present loves as new-revealed\nl
And all the hopes the future brings had failed\nl
Already, caught and spent in efforts vain,\nl
Repeated fruitlessly age after age.\nl
Unwearied all returned insisting still\nl
Because of joy in the anguish of pursuit\nl
And joy to labour and to win and lose\nl
And joy to create and keep and joy to kill.\nl
The rolling cycles passed and came again,\nl
Brought the same toils and the same barren end,\nl
Forms ever new and ever old, the long\nl
Appalling revolutions of the world.\nl

\spar Once more arose the great destroying Voice:\nl
Across the fruitless labour of the worlds\nl
His huge denial's all-defeating might\nl
Pursued the ignorant march of dolorous Time.\nl
“Behold the figures of this symbol realm,\nl
Its solid outlines of creative dream\nl
Inspiring the great concrete tasks of earth.\nl
In its motion-parable of human life\nl
Here thou canst trace the outcome Nature gives\nl
To the sin of being and the error in things\nl
And the desire that compels to live\nl
And man's incurable malady of hope.\nl
In an immutable order's hierarchy\nl
Where Nature changes not, man cannot change:\nl
Ever he obeys her fixed mutation's law;\nl
In a new version of her oft-told tale\nl
In ever-wheeling cycles turns the race.\nl
His mind is pent in circling boundaries:\nl
For mind is man, beyond thought he cannot soar.\nl
If he could leave his limits he would be safe:\nl
Page 643

He sees but cannot mount to his greater heavens;\nl
Even winged, he sinks back to his native soil.\nl
He is a captive in his net of mind\nl
And beats soul-wings against the walls of life.\nl
In vain his heart lifts up its yearning prayer,\nl
Peopling with brilliant Gods the formless Void;\nl
Then disappointed to the Void he turns\nl
And in its happy nothingness asks release,\nl
The calm Nirvana of his dream of self:\nl
The Word in silence ends, in Nought the name.\nl
Apart amid the mortal multitudes,\nl
He calls the Godhead incommunicable\nl
To be the lover of his lonely soul\nl
Or casts his spirit into its void embrace.\nl
Or he finds his copy in the impartial All;\nl
He imparts to the Immobile his own will,\nl
Attributes to the Eternal wrath and love\nl
And to the Ineffable lends a thousand names.\nl
Hope not to call God down into his life.\nl
How shalt thou bring the Everlasting here?\nl
There is no house for him in hurrying Time.\nl
Vainly thou seekst in Matter's world an aim;\nl
No aim is there, only a will to be.\nl
All walk by Nature bound for ever the same.\nl
Look on these forms that stay awhile and pass,\nl
These lives that long and strive, then are no more,\nl
These structures that have no abiding truth,\nl
The saviour creeds that cannot save themselves,\nl
But perish in the strangling hands of the years,\nl
Discarded from man's thought, proved false by Time,\nl
Philosophies that strip all problems bare\nl
But nothing ever have solved since earth began,\nl
And sciences omnipotent in vain\nl
By which men learn of what the suns are made,\nl
Transform all forms to serve their outward needs,\nl
Ride through the sky and sail beneath the sea,\nl
Page 644

But learn not what they are or why they came;\nl
These polities, architectures of man's brain,\nl
That, bricked with evil and good, wall in man's spirit\nl
And, fissured houses, palace at once and jail,\nl
Rot while they reign and crumble before they crash;\nl
These revolutions, demon or drunken god,\nl
Convulsing the wounded body of mankind\nl
Only to paint in new colours an old face;\nl
These wars, carnage triumphant, ruin gone mad,\nl
The work of centuries vanishing in an hour,\nl
The blood of the vanquished and the victor's crown\nl
Which men to be born must pay for with their pain,\nl
The hero's face divine on satyr's limbs,\nl
The demon's grandeur mixed with the demigod's,\nl
The glory and the beasthood and the shame;\nl
Why is it all, the labour and the din,\nl
The transient joys, the timeless sea of tears,\nl
The longing and the hoping and the cry,\nl
The battle and the victory and the fall,\nl
The aimless journey that can never pause,\nl
The waking toil, the incoherent sleep,\nl
Song, shouts and weeping, wisdom and idle words,\nl
The laughter of men, the irony of the gods?\nl
Where leads the march, whither the pilgrimage?\nl
Who keeps the map of the route or planned each stage?\nl
Or else self-moved the world walks its own way,\nl
Or nothing is there but only a Mind that dreams:\nl
The world is a myth that happened to come true,\nl
A legend told to itself by conscious Mind,\nl
Imaged and played on a feigned Matter's ground\nl
On which it stands in an unsubstantial Vast.\nl
Mind is the author, spectator, actor, stage:\nl
Mind only is and what it thinks is seen.\nl
If Mind is all, renounce the hope of bliss;\nl
If Mind is all, renounce the hope of Truth.\nl
For Mind can never touch the body of Truth\nl
Page 645

And Mind can never see the soul of God;\nl
Only his shadow it grasps nor hears his laugh\nl
As it turns from him to the vain seeming of things.\nl
Mind is a tissue woven of light and shade\nl
Where right and wrong have sewn their mingled parts;\nl
Or Mind is Nature's marriage of convenance\nl
Between truth and falsehood, between joy and pain:\nl
This struggling pair no court can separate.\nl
Each thought is a gold coin with bright alloy\nl
And error and truth are its obverse and reverse:\nl
This is the imperial mintage of the brain\nl
And of this kind is all its currency.\nl
Think not to plant on earth the living Truth\nl
Or make of Matter's world the home of God;\nl
Truth comes not there but only the thought of Truth,\nl
God is not there but only the name of God.\nl
If Self there is it is bodiless and unborn;\nl
It is no one and it is possessed by none.\nl
On what shalt thou then build thy happy world?\nl
Cast off thy life and mind, then art thou Self,\nl
An all-seeing omnipresence stark, alone.\nl
If God there is he cares not for the world;\nl
All things he sees with calm indifferent gaze,\nl
He has doomed all hearts to sorrow and desire,\nl
He has bound all life with his implacable laws;\nl
He answers not the ignorant voice of prayer.\nl
Eternal while the ages toil beneath,\nl
Unmoved, untouched by aught that he has made,\nl
He sees as minute details mid the stars\nl
The animal's agony and the fate of man:\nl
Immeasurably wise, he exceeds thy thought;\nl
His solitary joy needs not thy love.\nl
His truth in human thinking cannot dwell:\nl
If thou desirest Truth, then still thy mind\nl
For ever, slain by the dumb unseen Light.\nl
Immortal bliss lives not in human air:\nl
Page 646

How shall the mighty Mother her calm delight\nl
Keep fragrant in this narrow fragile vase,\nl
Or lodge her sweet unbroken ecstasy\nl
In hearts which earthly sorrow can assail\nl
And bodies careless Death can slay at will?\nl
Dream not to change the world that God has planned,\nl
Strive not to alter his eternal law.\nl
If heavens there are whose gates are shut to grief,\nl
There seek the joy thou couldst not find on earth;\nl
Or in the imperishable hemisphere\nl
Where Light is native and Delight is king\nl
And Spirit is the deathless ground of things,\nl
Choose thy high station, child of Eternity.\nl
If thou art Spirit and Nature is thy robe,\nl
Cast off thy garb and be thy naked self\nl
Immutable in its undying truth,\nl
Alone for ever in the mute Alone.\nl
Turn then to God, for him leave all behind;\nl
Forgetting love, forgetting Satyavan,\nl
Annul thyself in his immobile peace.\nl
O soul, drown in his still beatitude.\nl
For thou must die to thyself to reach God's height:\nl
I, Death, am the gate of immortality.”\nl
But Savitri answered to the sophist God:\nl
“Once more wilt thou call Light to blind Truth's eyes,\nl
Make Knowledge a catch of the snare of Ignorance\nl
And the Word a dart to slay my living soul?\nl
Offer, O King, thy boons to tired spirits\nl
And hearts that could not bear the wounds of Time,\nl
Let those who were tied to body and to mind,\nl
Tear off those bonds and flee into white calm\nl
Crying for a refuge from the play of God.\nl
Surely thy boons are great since thou art He!\nl
But how shall I seek rest in endless peace\nl
Who house the mighty Mother's violent force,\nl
Her vision turned to read the enigmaed world,\nl
Page 647

Her will tempered in the blaze of Wisdom's sun\nl
And the flaming silence of her heart of love?\nl
The world is a spiritual paradox\nl
Invented by a need in the Unseen,\nl
A poor translation to the creature's sense\nl
Of That which for ever exceeds idea and speech,\nl
A symbol of what can never be symbolised,\nl
A language mispronounced, misspelt, yet true.\nl
Its powers have come from the eternal heights\nl
And plunged into the inconscient dim Abyss\nl
And risen from it to do their marvellous work.\nl
The soul is a figure of the Unmanifest,\nl
The mind labours to think the Unthinkable,\nl
The life to call the Immortal into birth,\nl
The body to enshrine the Illimitable.\nl
The world is not cut off from Truth and God.\nl
In vain thou hast dug the dark unbridgeable gulf,\nl
In vain thou hast built the blind and doorless wall:\nl
Man's soul crosses through thee to Paradise,\nl
Heaven's sun forces its way through death and night;\nl
Its light is seen upon our being's verge.\nl
My mind is a torch lit from the eternal sun,\nl
My life a breath drawn by the immortal Guest,\nl
My mortal body is the Eternal's house.\nl
Already the torch becomes the undying ray,\nl
Already the life is the Immortal's force,\nl
The house grows of the householder part and one.\nl
How sayst thou Truth can never light the human mind\nl
And Bliss can never invade the mortal's heart\nl
Or God descend into the world he made?\nl
If in the meaningless Void creation rose,\nl
If from a bodiless Force Matter was born,\nl
If Life could climb in the unconscious tree,\nl
Its green delight break into emerald leaves\nl
And its laughter of beauty blossom in the flower,\nl
If sense could wake in tissue, nerve and cell\nl
Page 648

And Thought seize the grey matter of the brain,\nl
And soul peep from its secrecy through the flesh,\nl
How shall the nameless Light not leap on men,\nl
And unknown powers emerge from Nature's sleep?\nl
Even now hints of a luminous Truth like stars\nl
Arise in the mind-mooned splendour of Ignorance;\nl
Even now the deathless Lover's touch we feel:\nl
If the chamber's door is even a little ajar,\nl
What then can hinder God from stealing in\nl
Or who forbid his kiss on the sleeping soul?\nl
Already God is near, the Truth is close:\nl
Because the dark atheist body knows him not,\nl
Must the sage deny the Light, the seer his soul?\nl
I am not bound by thought or sense or shape;\nl
I live in the glory of the Infinite,\nl
I am near to the Nameless and Unknowable,\nl
The Ineffable is now my household mate.\nl
But standing on Eternity's luminous brink\nl
I have discovered that the world was He;\nl
I have met Spirit with spirit, Self with self,\nl
But I have loved too the body of my God.\nl
I have pursued him in his earthly form.\nl
A lonely freedom cannot satisfy\nl
A heart that has grown one with every heart:\nl
I am a deputy of the aspiring world,\nl
My spirit's liberty I ask for all.”\nl

\spar Then rang again a deeper cry of Death.\nl
As if beneath its weight of sterile law\nl
Oppressed by its own obstinate meaningless will,\nl
Disdainful, weary and compassionate,\nl
It kept no more its old intolerant sound,\nl
But seemed like life's in her unnumbered paths\nl
Toiling for ever and achieving nought\nl
Because of birth and change, her mortal powers\nl
By which she lasts, around the term-posts fixed\nl
Page 649

Turning of a wide circling aimless race\nl
Whose course for ever speeds and is the same.\nl
In its long play with Fate and Chance and Time\nl
Assured of the game's vanity lost or won,\nl
Crushed by its load of ignorance and doubt\nl
Which knowledge seems to increase and growth to enlarge,\nl
The earth-mind sinks and it despairs and looks\nl
Old, weary and discouraged on its work.\nl
Yet was all nothing then or vainly achieved?\nl
Some great thing has been done, some light, some power\nl
Delivered from the huge Inconscient's grasp:\nl
It has emerged from night; it sees its dawns\nl
Circling for ever though no dawn can stay.\nl
This change was in the godhead's far-flung voice;\nl
His form of dread was altered and admitted\nl
Our transient effort at eternity,\nl
Yet flung vast doubts of what might else have been\nl
On grandiose hints of an impossible day.\nl
The great voice surging cried to Savitri:\nl
“Because thou knowst the wisdom that transcends\nl
Both veil of forms and the contempt of forms,\nl
Arise delivered by the seeing gods.\nl
If free thou hadst kept thy mind from life's fierce stress,\nl
Thou mightst have been like them omniscient, calm.\nl
But the violent and passionate heart forbids.\nl
It is the storm bird of an anarch Power\nl
That would upheave the world and tear from it\nl
The indecipherable scroll of Fate,\nl
Death's rule and Law and the unknowable Will.\nl
Hasteners to action, violators of God\nl
Are these great spirits who have too much love,\nl
And they who formed like thee, for both art thou,\nl
Have come into the narrow bounds of life\nl
With too large natures overleaping time.\nl
Worshippers of force who know not her recoil,\nl
Their giant wills compel the troubled years.\nl
Page 650

The wise are tranquil; silent the great hills\nl
Rise ceaselessly towards their unreached sky,\nl
Seated on their unchanging base, their heads\nl
Dreamless in heaven's immutable domain.\nl
On their aspiring tops, sublime and still,\nl
Lifting half-way to heaven the climbing soul\nl
The mighty mediators stand content\nl
To watch the revolutions of the stars:\nl
Motionlessly moving with the might of earth,\nl
They see the ages pass and are the same.\nl
The wise think with the cycles, they hear the tread\nl
Of far-off things; patient, unmoved they keep\nl
Their dangerous wisdom in their depths restrained,\nl
Lest man's frail days into the unknown should sink\nl
Dragged like a ship by bound leviathan\nl
Into the abyss of his stupendous seas.\nl
Lo, how all shakes when the gods tread too near!\nl
All moves, is in peril, anguished, torn, upheaved.\nl
The hurrying aeons would stumble on too swift\nl
If strength from heaven surprised the imperfect earth\nl
And veilless knowledge smote these unfit souls.\nl
The deities have screened their dreadful power:\nl
God hides his thought and, even, he seems to err.\nl
Be still and tardy in the slow wise world.\nl
Mighty art thou with the dread goddess filled,\nl
To whom thou criedst at dawn in the dim woods.\nl
Use not thy strength like the wild Titan souls!\nl
Touch not the seated lines, the ancient laws,\nl
Respect the calm of great established things.”\nl
But Savitri replied to the huge god:\nl
“What is the calm thou vauntst, O Law, O Death?\nl
Is it not the dull-visioned tread inert\nl
Of monstrous energies chained in a stark round\nl
Soulless and stone-eyed with mechanic dreams?\nl
Vain the soul's hope if changeless Law is all:\nl
Ever to the new and the unknown press on\nl
Page 651

The speeding aeons justifying God.\nl
What were earth's ages if the grey restraint\nl
Were never broken and glories sprang not forth\nl
Bursting their obscure seed, while man's slow life\nl
Leaped hurried into sudden splendid paths\nl
By divine words and human gods revealed?\nl
Impose not upon sentient minds and hearts\nl
The dull fixity that binds inanimate things.\nl
Well is the unconscious rule for the animal breeds\nl
Content to live beneath the immutable yoke;\nl
Man turns to a nobler walk, a master path.\nl
I trample on thy law with living feet;\nl
For to arise in freedom I was born.\nl
If I am mighty let my force be unveiled\nl
Equal companion of the dateless powers,\nl
Or else let my frustrated soul sink down\nl
Unworthy of Godhead in the original sleep.\nl
I claim from Time my will's eternity,\nl
God from his moments.” Death replied to her,\nl
“Why should the noble and immortal will\nl
Stoop to the petty works of transient earth,\nl
Freedom forgotten and the Eternal's path?\nl
Or is this the high use of strength and thought,\nl
To struggle with the bonds of death and time\nl
And spend the labour that might earn the gods\nl
And battle and bear agony of wounds\nl
To grasp the trivial joys that earth can guard\nl
In her small treasure-chest of passing things?\nl
Child, hast thou trodden the gods beneath thy feet\nl
Only to win poor shreds of earthly life\nl
For him thou lov'st cancelling the grand release,\nl
Keeping from early rapture of the heavens\nl
His soul the lenient deities have called?\nl
Are thy arms sweeter than the courts of God?”\nl
She answered, “Straight I trample on the road\nl
The strong hand hewed for me which planned our paths.\nl
Page 652

I run where his sweet dreadful voice commands\nl
And I am driven by the reins of God.\nl
Why drew he wide his scheme of mighty worlds\nl
Or filled infinity with his passionate breath?\nl
Or wherefore did he build my mortal form\nl
And sow in me his bright and proud desires,\nl
If not to achieve, to flower in me, to love,\nl
Carving his human image richly shaped\nl
In thoughts and largenesses and golden powers?\nl
Far Heaven can wait our coming in its calm.\nl
Easy the heavens were to build for God.\nl
Earth was his difficult matter, earth the glory\nl
Gave of the problem and the race and strife.\nl
There are the ominous masks, the terrible powers;\nl
There it is greatness to create the gods.\nl
Is not the spirit immortal and absolved\nl
Always, delivered from the grasp of Time?\nl
Why came it down into the mortal's Space?\nl
A charge he gave to his high spirit in man\nl
And wrote a hidden decree on Nature's tops.\nl
Freedom is this with ever seated soul,\nl
Large in life's limits, strong in Matter's knots,\nl
Building great stuff of action from the worlds\nl
To make fine wisdom from coarse, scattered strands\nl
And love and beauty out of war and night,\nl
The wager wonderful, the game divine.\nl
What liberty has the soul which feels not free\nl
Unless stripped bare and cannot kiss the bonds\nl
The Lover winds around his playmate's limbs,\nl
Choosing his tyranny, crushed in his embrace?\nl
To seize him better with her boundless heart\nl
She accepts the limiting circle of his arms,\nl
Bows full of bliss beneath his mastering hands\nl
And laughs in his rich constraints, most bound, most free.\nl
This is my answer to thy lures, O Death.”\nl
Page 653

\spar Immutable, Death's denial met her cry:\nl
“However mighty, whatever thy secret name\nl
Uttered in hidden conclaves of the gods,\nl
Thy heart's ephemeral passion cannot break\nl
The iron rampart of accomplished things\nl
With which the great Gods fence their camp in Space.\nl
Whoever thou art behind thy human mask,\nl
Even if thou art the Mother of the worlds\nl
And pegst thy claim upon the realms of Chance,\nl
The cosmic Law is greater than thy will.\nl
Even God himself obeys the Laws he made:\nl
The Law abides and never can it change,\nl
The Person is a bubble on Time's sea.\nl
A forerunner of a greater Truth to come,\nl
Thy soul creator of its freer Law,\nl
Vaunting a Force behind on which it leans,\nl
A Light above which none but thou hast seen,\nl
Thou claimst the first fruits of Truth's victory.\nl
But what is Truth and who can find her form\nl
Amid the specious images of sense,\nl
Amid the crowding guesses of the mind\nl
And the dark ambiguities of a world\nl
Peopled with the incertitudes of Thought?\nl
For where is Truth and when was her footfall heard\nl
Amid the endless clamour of Time's mart\nl
And which is her voice amid the thousand cries\nl
That cross the listening brain and cheat the soul?\nl
Or is Truth aught but a high starry name\nl
Or a vague and splendid word by which man's thought\nl
Sanctions and consecrates his nature's choice,\nl
The heart's wish donning knowledge as its robe,\nl
The cherished idea elect among the elect,\nl
Thought's favourite mid the children of half-light\nl
Who high-voiced crowd the playgrounds of the mind\nl
Or people its dormitories in infant sleep?\nl
All things hang here between God's yes and no,\nl
Page 654

Two Powers real but to each other untrue,\nl
Two consort stars in the mooned night of mind\nl
That towards two opposite horizons gaze,\nl
The white head and black tail of the mystic drake,\nl
The swift and the lame foot, wing strong, wing broken\nl
Sustaining the body of the uncertain world,\nl
A great surreal dragon in the skies.\nl
Too dangerously thy high proud truth must live\nl
Entangled in Matter's mortal littleness.\nl
All in this world is true, yet all is false:\nl
Its thoughts into an eternal cipher run,\nl
Its deeds swell to Time's rounded zero sum.\nl
Thus man at once is animal and god,\nl
A disparate enigma of God's make\nl
Unable to free the Godhead's form within,\nl
A being less than himself, yet something more,\nl
The aspiring animal, the frustrate god\nl
Yet neither beast nor deity but man,\nl
But man tied to the kind earth's labour strives to exceed\nl
Climbing the stairs of God to higher things.\nl
Objects are seemings and none knows their truth,\nl
Ideas are guesses of an ignorant god.\nl
Truth has no home in earth's irrational breast:\nl
Yet without reason life is a tangle of dreams,\nl
But reason is poised above a dim abyss\nl
And stands at last upon a plank of doubt.\nl
Eternal truth lives not with mortal men.\nl
Or if she dwells within thy mortal heart,\nl
Show me the body of the living Truth\nl
Or draw for me the outline of her face\nl
That I too may obey and worship her.\nl
Then will I give thee back thy Satyavan.\nl
But here are only facts and steel-bound Law.\nl
This truth I know that Satyavan is dead\nl
And even thy sweetness cannot lure him back.\nl
No magic Truth can bring the dead to life,\nl
Page 655

No power of earth cancel the thing once done,\nl
No joy of the heart can last surviving death,\nl
No bliss persuade the past to live again.\nl
But Life alone can solace the mute Void\nl
And fill with thought the emptiness of Time.\nl
Leave then thy dead, O Savitri, and live.”\nl
The Woman answered to the mighty Shade,\nl
And as she spoke, mortality disappeared;\nl
Her Goddess self grew visible in her eyes,\nl
Light came, a dream of heaven, into her face.\nl
“O Death, thou too art God and yet not He,\nl
But only his own black shadow on his path\nl
As leaving the Night he takes the upward Way\nl
And drags with him its clinging inconscient Force.\nl
Of God unconscious thou art the dark head,\nl
Of his Ignorance thou art the impenitent sign,\nl
Of its vast tenebrous womb the natural child,\nl
On his immortality the sinister bar.\nl
All contraries are aspects of God's face.\nl
The Many are the innumerable One,\nl
The One carries the multitude in his breast;\nl
He is the Impersonal, inscrutable, sole,\nl
He is the one infinite Person seeing his world;\nl
The Silence bears the Eternal's great dumb seal,\nl
His light inspires the eternal Word;\nl
He is the Immobile's deep and deathless hush,\nl
Its white and signless blank negating calm,\nl
Yet stands the creator Self, the almighty Lord\nl
And watches his will done by the forms of Gods\nl
And the desire that goads half-conscious man\nl
And the reluctant and unseeing Night.\nl
These wide divine extremes, these inverse powers\nl
Are the right and left side of the body of God;\nl
Existence balanced twixt two mighty arms\nl
Confronts the mind with unsolved abysms of Thought.\nl
Darkness below, a fathomless Light above,\nl
Page 656

In Light are joined, but sundered by severing Mind\nl
Stand face to face, opposite, inseparable,\nl
Two contraries needed for his great World-task,\nl
Two poles whose currents wake the immense World-Force.\nl
In the stupendous secrecy of his Self,\nl
Above the world brooding with equal wings,\nl
He is both in one, beginningless, without end:\nl
Transcending both, he enters the Absolute.\nl
His being is a mystery beyond mind,\nl
His ways bewilder mortal ignorance;\nl
The finite in its little sections parked,\nl
Amazed, credits not God's audacity\nl
Who dares to be the unimagined All\nl
And see and act as might one Infinite.\nl
Against human reason this is his offence,\nl
Being known to be for ever unknowable,\nl
To be all and yet transcend the mystic whole,\nl
Absolute, to lodge in a relative world of Time,\nl
Eternal and all-knowing, to suffer birth,\nl
Omnipotent, to sport with Chance and Fate,\nl
Spirit, yet to be Matter and the Void,\nl
Illimitable, beyond form or name,\nl
To dwell within a body, one and supreme\nl
To be animal and human and divine:\nl
A still deep sea, he laughs in rolling waves;\nl
Universal, he is all,—transcendent, none.\nl
To man's righteousness this is his cosmic crime,\nl
Almighty beyond good and evil to dwell\nl
Leaving the good to their fate in a wicked world\nl
And evil to reign in this enormous scene.\nl
All opposition seems and strife and chance,\nl
An aimless labour with but scanty sense,\nl
To eyes that see a part and miss the whole;\nl
The surface men scan, the depths refuse their search:\nl
A hybrid mystery challenges the view,\nl
Or a discouraging sordid miracle.\nl
Page 657

Yet in the exact Inconscient's stark conceit,\nl
In the casual error of the world's ignorance\nl
A plan, a hidden Intelligence is glimpsed.\nl
There is a purpose in each stumble and fall;\nl
Nature's most careless lolling is a pose\nl
Preparing some forward step, some deep result.\nl
Ingenious notes plugged into a motived score,\nl
These million discords dot the harmonious theme\nl
Of the evolution's huge orchestral dance.\nl
A Truth supreme has forced the world to be;\nl
It has wrapped itself in Matter as in a shroud,\nl
A shroud of Death, a shroud of Ignorance.\nl
It compelled the suns to burn through silent Space,\nl
Flame-signs of its uncomprehended Thought\nl
In a wide brooding ether's formless muse:\nl
It made of Knowledge a veiled and struggling light,\nl
Of Being a substance nescient, dense and dumb,\nl
Of Bliss the beauty of an insentient world.\nl
In finite things the conscious Infinite dwells:\nl
Involved it sleeps in Matter's helpless trance,\nl
It rules the world from its sleeping senseless Void;\nl
Dreaming it throws out mind and heart and soul\nl
To labour crippled, bound, on the hard earth;\nl
A broken whole it works through scattered points;\nl
Its gleaming shards are Wisdom's diamond thoughts,\nl
Its shadowy reflex our ignorance.\nl
It starts from the mute mass in countless jets,\nl
It fashions a being out of brain and nerve,\nl
A sentient creature from its pleasures and pangs.\nl
A pack of feelings obscure, a dot of sense\nl
Survives awhile answering the shocks of life,\nl
Then, crushed or its force spent, leaves the dead form,\nl
Leaves the huge universe in which it lived\nl
An insignificant unconsidered guest.\nl
But the soul grows concealed within its house;\nl
It gives to the body its strength and magnificence;\nl
Page 658

It follows aims in an ignorant aimless world,\nl
It lends significance to earth's meaningless life.\nl
A demigod animal, came thinking man;\nl
He wallows in mud, yet heavenward soars in thought;\nl
He plays and ponders, laughs and weeps and dreams,\nl
Satisfies his little longings like the beast;\nl
He pores upon life's book with student eyes.\nl
Out of this tangle of intellect and sense,\nl
Out of the narrow scope of finite thought\nl
At last he wakes into spiritual mind;\nl
A high liberty begins and luminous room:\nl
He glimpses eternity, touches the infinite,\nl
He meets the gods in great and sudden hours,\nl
He feels the universe as his larger self,\nl
Makes Space and Time his opportunity\nl
To join the heights and depths of being in light,\nl
In the heart's cave speaks secretly with God.\nl
But these are touches and high moments lived;\nl
Fragments of Truth supreme have lit his soul,\nl
Reflections of the sun in waters still.\nl
A few have dared the last supreme ascent\nl
And break through borders of blinding light above,\nl
And feel a breath around of mightier air,\nl
Receive a vaster being's messages\nl
And bathe in its immense intuitive Ray.\nl
On summit Mind are radiant altitudes\nl
Exposed to the lustre of Infinity,\nl
Outskirts and dependencies of the house of Truth,\nl
Upraised estates of Mind and measureless.\nl
There man can visit but there he cannot live.\nl
A cosmic Thought spreads out its vastitudes;\nl
Its smallest parts are here philosophies\nl
Challenging with their detailed immensity,\nl
Each figuring an omniscient scheme of things.\nl
But higher still can climb the ascending light;\nl
There are vasts of vision and eternal suns,\nl
Page 659

Oceans of an immortal luminousness,\nl
Flame-hills assaulting heaven with their peaks,\nl
There dwelling all becomes a blaze of sight;\nl
A burning head of vision leads the mind,\nl
Thought trails behind it its long comet tail;\nl
The heart glows, an illuminate and seer,\nl
And sense is kindled into identity.\nl
A highest flight climbs to a deepest view:\nl
In a wide opening of its native sky\nl
Intuition's lightnings range in a bright pack\nl
Hunting all hidden truths out of their lairs,\nl
Its fiery edge of seeing absolute\nl
Cleaves into locked unknown retreats of self,\nl
Rummages the sky-recesses of the brain,\nl
Lights up the occult chambers of the heart;\nl
Its spear-point ictus of discovery\nl
Pressed on the cover of name, the screen of form,\nl
Strips bare the secret soul of all that is.\nl
Thought there has revelation's sun-bright eyes;\nl
The Word, a mighty and inspiring Voice,\nl
Enters Truth's inmost cabin of privacy\nl
And tears away the veil from God and life.\nl
Then stretches the boundless finite's last expanse,\nl
The cosmic empire of the Overmind,\nl
Time's buffer state bordering Eternity,\nl
Too vast for the experience of man's soul:\nl
All here gathers beneath one golden sky:\nl
The Powers that build the cosmos station take\nl
In its house of infinite possibility;\nl
Each god from there builds his own nature's world;\nl
Ideas are phalanxed like a group of suns,\nl
Each marshalling his company of rays.\nl
Thought crowds in masses seized by one regard;\nl
All Time is one body, Space a single look:\nl
There is the Godhead's universal gaze\nl
And there the boundaries of immortal Mind:\nl
Page 660

The line that parts and joins the hemispheres\nl
Closes in on the labour of the Gods\nl
Fencing eternity from the toil of Time.\nl
In her glorious kingdom of eternal light\nl
All-ruler, ruled by none, the Truth supreme,\nl
Omnipotent, omniscient and alone,\nl
In a golden country keeps her measureless house;\nl
In its corridor she hears the tread that comes\nl
Out of the Unmanifest never to return\nl
Till the Unknown is known and seen by men.\nl
Above the stretch and blaze of cosmic Sight,\nl
Above the silence of the wordless Thought,\nl
Formless creator of immortal forms,\nl
Nameless, investitured with the name divine,\nl
Transcending Time's hours, transcending Timelessness,\nl
The Mighty Mother sits in lucent calm\nl
And holds the eternal Child upon her knees\nl
Attending the day when he shall speak to Fate.\nl
There is the image of our future's hope;\nl
There is the sun for which all darkness waits,\nl
There is the imperishable harmony;\nl
The world's contradictions climb to her and are one:\nl
There is the Truth of which the world's truths are shreds,\nl
The Light of which the world's ignorance is the shade\nl
Till Truth draws back the shade that it has cast,\nl
The Love our hearts call down to heal all strife,\nl
The Bliss for which the world's derelict sorrows yearn:\nl
Thence comes the glory sometimes seen on earth,\nl
The visits of Godhead to the human soul,\nl
The Beauty and the dream on Nature's face.\nl
There the perfection born from eternity\nl
Calls to it the perfection born in Time,\nl
The truth of God surprising human life,\nl
The image of God overtaking finite shapes.\nl
There in a world of everlasting Light,\nl
In the realms of the immortal Supermind\nl
Page 661

Truth who hides here her head in mystery,\nl
Her riddle deemed by reason impossible\nl
In the stark structure of material form,\nl
Unenigmaed lives, unmasked her face and there\nl
Is Nature and the common law of things.\nl
There in a body made of spirit stuff,\nl
The hearth-stone of the everliving Fire,\nl
Action translates the movements of the soul,\nl
Thought steps infallible and absolute\nl
And life is a continual worship's rite,\nl
A sacrifice of rapture to the One.\nl
A cosmic vision, a spiritual sense\nl
Feels all the Infinite lodged in finite form\nl
And seen through a quivering ecstasy of light\nl
Discovers the bright face of the Bodiless,\nl
In the truth of a moment, in the moment's soul\nl
Can sip the honey-wine of Eternity.\nl
A Spirit who is no one and innumerable,\nl
The one mystic infinite Person of his world\nl
Multiplies his myriad personality,\nl
On all his bodies seals his divinity's stamp\nl
And sits in each immortal and unique.\nl
The Immobile stands behind each daily act,\nl
A background of the movement and the scene,\nl
Upholding creation on its might and calm\nl
And change on the Immutable's deathless poise.\nl
The Timeless looks out from the travelling hours;\nl
The Ineffable puts on a robe of speech\nl
Where all its words are woven like magic threads\nl
Moving with beauty, inspiring with their gleam,\nl
And every thought takes up its destined place\nl
Recorded in the memory of the world.\nl
The Truth supreme, vast and impersonal\nl
Fits faultlessly the hour and circumstance,\nl
Its substance a pure gold ever the same\nl
But shaped into vessels for the spirit's use,\nl
Page 662

Its gold becomes the wine jar and the vase.\nl
All there is a supreme epiphany:\nl
The All-Wonderful makes a marvel of each event,\nl
The All-Beautiful is a miracle in each shape;\nl
The All-Blissful smites with rapture the heart's throbs,\nl
A pure celestial joy is the use of sense.\nl
Each being there is a member of the Self,\nl
A portion of the million-thoughted All,\nl
A claimant to the timeless Unity,\nl
The many's sweetness, the joy of difference\nl
Edged with the intimacy of the One.\nl
\sparn “But who can show to thee Truth's glorious face?\nl
Our human words can only shadow her.\nl
To thought she is an unthinkable rapture of light,\nl
To speech a marvel inexpressible.\nl
O Death, if thou couldst touch the Truth supreme\nl
Thou wouldst grow suddenly wise and cease to be.\nl
If our souls could see and love and clasp God's Truth,\nl
Its infinite radiance would seize our hearts,\nl
Our being in God's image be remade\nl
And earthly life become the life divine.”\nl
Then Death the last time answered Savitri:\nl
“If Truth supreme transcends her shadow here\nl
Severed by Knowledge and the climbing vasts,\nl
What bridge can cross the gulf that she has left\nl
Between her and the dream-world she has made?\nl
Or who could hope to bring her down to men\nl
And persuade to tread the harsh globe with wounded feet\nl
Leaving her unapproachable glory and bliss,\nl
Wasting her splendour on pale earthly air?\nl
Is thine that strength, O beauty of mortal limbs,\nl
O soul who flutterest to escape my net?\nl
Who then art thou hiding in human guise?\nl
Thy voice carries the sound of infinity,\nl
Knowledge is with thee, Truth speaks through thy words;\nl
The light of things beyond shines in thy eyes.\nl
Page 663

But where is thy strength to conquer Time and Death?\nl
Hast thou God's force to build heaven's values here?\nl
For truth and knowledge are an idle gleam\nl
If Knowledge brings not power to change the world,\nl
If Might comes not to give to Truth her right.\nl
A blind Force, not Truth has made this ignorant world,\nl
A blind Force, not Truth orders the lives of men:\nl
By Power, not Light, the great Gods rule the world;\nl
Power is the arm of God, the seal of Fate.\nl
O human claimant to immortality,\nl
Reveal thy power, lay bare thy spirit's force,\nl
Then will I give back to thee Satyavan.\nl
Or if the Mighty Mother is with thee,\nl
Show me her face that I may worship her;\nl
Let deathless eyes look into the eyes of Death,\nl
An imperishable Force touching brute things\nl
Transform earth's death into immortal life.\nl
Then can thy dead return to thee and live.\nl
The prostrate earth perhaps shall lift her gaze\nl
And feel near her the secret body of God\nl
And love and joy overtake fleeing Time.”\nl

\spar And Savitri looked on Death and answered not.\nl
Almost it seemed as if in his symbol shape\nl
The world's darkness had consented to Heaven-light\nl
And God needed no more the Inconscient's screen.\nl
A mighty transformation came on her.\nl
A halo of the indwelling Deity,\nl
The Immortal's lustre that had lit her face\nl
And tented its radiance in her body's house,\nl
Overflowing made the air a luminous sea.\nl
In a flaming moment of apocalypse\nl
The Incarnation thrust aside its veil.\nl
A little figure in infinity\nl
Yet stood and seemed the Eternal's very house,\nl
As if the world's centre was her very soul\nl
Page 664

And all wide space was but its outer robe.\nl
A curve of the calm hauteur of far heaven\nl
Descending into earth's humility,\nl
Her forehead's span vaulted the Omniscient's gaze,\nl
Her eyes were two stars that watched the universe.\nl
The Power that from her being's summit reigned,\nl
The Presence chambered in lotus secrecy,\nl
Came down and held the centre in her brow\nl
Where the mind's Lord in his control-room sits;\nl
There throned on concentration's native seat\nl
He opens that third mysterious eye in man,\nl
The Unseen's eye that looks at the unseen,\nl
When Light with a golden ecstasy fills his brain\nl
And the Eternal's wisdom drives his choice\nl
And eternal Will seizes the mortal's will.\nl
It stirred in the lotus of her throat of song,\nl
And in her speech throbbed the immortal Word,\nl
Her life sounded with the steps of the world-soul\nl
Moving in harmony with the cosmic Thought.\nl
As glides God's sun into the mystic cave\nl
Where hides his light from the pursuing gods,\nl
It glided into the lotus of her heart\nl
And woke in it the Force that alters Fate.\nl
It poured into her navel's lotus depth,\nl
Lodged in the little life-nature's narrow home,\nl
On the body's longings grew heaven-rapture's flower\nl
And made desire a pure celestial flame,\nl
Broke into the cave where coiled World-Energy sleeps\nl
And smote the thousand-hooded serpent Force\nl
That blazing towered and clasped the World-Self above,\nl
Joined Matter's dumbness to the Spirit's hush\nl
And filled earth's acts with the Spirit's silent power.\nl
Thus changed she waited for the Word to speak.\nl
Eternity looked into the eyes of Death\nl
And Darkness saw God's living Reality.\nl
Then a Voice was heard that seemed the stillness' self\nl
Page 665

Or the low calm utterance of infinity\nl
When it speaks to the silence in the heart of sleep.\nl
“I hail thee, almighty and victorious Death,\nl
Thou grandiose Darkness of the Infinite.\nl
O Void that makest room for all to be,\nl
Hunger that gnawest at the universe\nl
Consuming the cold remnants of the suns\nl
And eatst the whole world with thy jaws of fire,\nl
Waster of the energy that has made the stars,\nl
Inconscience, carrier of the seeds of thought,\nl
Nescience in which All-Knowledge sleeps entombed\nl
And slowly emerges in its hollow breast\nl
Wearing the mind's mask of bright Ignorance.\nl
Thou art my shadow and my instrument.\nl
I have given thee thy awful shape of dread\nl
And thy sharp sword of terror and grief and pain\nl
To force the soul of man to struggle for light\nl
On the brevity of his half-conscious days.\nl
Thou art his spur to greatness in his works,\nl
The whip to his yearning for eternal bliss,\nl
His poignant need of immortality.\nl
Live, Death, awhile, be still my instrument.\nl
One day man too shall know thy fathomless heart\nl
Of silence and the brooding peace of Night\nl
And grave obedience to eternal Law\nl
And the calm inflexible pity in thy gaze.\nl
But now, O timeless Mightiness, stand aside\nl
And leave the path of my incarnate Force.\nl
Relieve the radiant God from thy black mask:\nl
Release the soul of the world called Satyavan\nl
Freed from thy clutch of pain and ignorance\nl
That he may stand master of life and fate,\nl
Man's representative in the house of God,\nl
The mate of Wisdom and the spouse of Light,\nl
The eternal bridegroom of the eternal bride.”\nl
She spoke; Death unconvinced resisted still,\nl
Page 666

Although he knew refusing still to know,\nl
Although he saw refusing still to see.\nl
Unshakable he stood claiming his right.\nl
His spirit bowed; his will obeyed the law\nl
Of its own nature binding even on Gods.\nl
The Two opposed each other face to face.\nl
His being like a huge fort of darkness towered;\nl
Around it her light grew, an ocean's siege.\nl
Awhile the Shade survived defying heaven:\nl
Assailing in front, oppressing from above,\nl
A concrete mass of conscious power, he bore\nl
The tyranny of her divine desire.\nl
A pressure of intolerable force\nl
Weighed on his unbowed head and stubborn breast;\nl
Light like a burning tongue licked up his thoughts,\nl
Light was a luminous torture in his heart,\nl
Light coursed, a splendid agony, through his nerves;\nl
His darkness muttered perishing in her blaze.\nl
Her mastering Word commanded every limb\nl
And left no room for his enormous will\nl
That seemed pushed out into some helpless space\nl
And could no more re-enter but left him void.\nl
He called to Night but she fell shuddering back,\nl
He called to Hell but sullenly it retired:\nl
He turned to the Inconscient for support,\nl
From which he was born, his vast sustaining self;\nl
It drew him back towards boundless vacancy\nl
As if by himself to swallow up himself:\nl
He called to his strength, but it refused his call.\nl
His body was eaten by light, his spirit devoured.\nl
At last he knew defeat inevitable\nl
And left crumbling the shape that he had worn,\nl
Abandoning hope to make man's soul his prey\nl
And force to be mortal the immortal spirit.\nl
Afar he fled shunning her dreaded touch\nl
And refuge took in the retreating Night.\nl
Page 667

In the dream twilight of that symbol world\nl
The dire universal Shadow disappeared\nl
Vanishing into the Void from which it came.\nl
As if deprived of its original cause,\nl
The twilight realm passed fading from their souls,\nl
And Satyavan and Savitri were alone.\nl
But neither stirred: between those figures rose\nl
A mute invisible and translucent wall.\nl
In the long blank moment's pause nothing could move:\nl
All waited on the unknown inscrutable Will.\nl

\sbigcap A marvellous sun looked down from ecstasy's skies\nl
On worlds of deathless bliss, perfection's home,\nl
Magical unfoldings of the Eternal's smile\nl
Capturing his secret heart-beats of delight.\nl
God's everlasting day surrounded her,\nl
Domains appeared of sempiternal light\nl
Invading all Nature with the Absolute's joy.\nl
Her body quivered with eternity's touch,\nl
Her soul stood close to the founts of the infinite.\nl
Infinity's finite fronts she lived in, new\nl
For ever to an everliving sight.\nl
Eternity multiplied its vast self-look\nl
Translating its endless mightiness and joy\nl
Into delight souls playing with Time could share\nl
In grandeurs ever new-born from the unknown depths,\nl
In powers that leaped immortal from unknown heights,\nl
In passionate heart-beats of an undying love,\nl
In scenes of a sweetness that can never fade.\nl
Immortal to the rapturous heart and eyes,\nl
In serene arches of translucent calm\nl
From Wonder's dream-vasts cloudless skies slid down\nl
An abyss of sapphire; sunlight visited eyes\nl
Which suffered without pain the absolute ray\nl
And saw immortal clarities of form.\nl
Twilight and mist were exiles from that air,\nl
Night was impossible to such radiant heavens.\nl
Firm in the bosom of immensity\nl
Spiritual breadths were seen, sublimely born\nl
From a still beauty of creative joy;\nl
Embodied thoughts to sweet dimensions held\nl
Page 671

To please some carelessness of divine peace,\nl
Answered the deep demand of an infinite sense\nl
And its need of forms to house its bodiless thrill.\nl
A march of universal powers in Time,\nl
The harmonic order of self's vastitudes\nl
In cyclic symmetries and metric planes\nl
Harboured a cosmic rapture's revelry,\nl
An endless figuring of the spirit in things\nl
Planned by the artist who has dreamed the worlds;\nl
Of all the beauty and the marvel here,\nl
Of all Time's intricate variety\nl
Eternity was the substance and the source;\nl
Not from a plastic mist of Matter made,\nl
They offered the suggestion of their depths\nl
And opened the great series of their powers.\nl
Arisen beneath a triple mystic heaven\nl
The seven immortal earths were seen, sublime:\nl
Homes of the blest released from death and sleep\nl
Where grief can never come nor any pang\nl
Arriving from self-lost and seeking worlds\nl
Alter Heaven-nature's changeless quietude\nl
And mighty posture of eternal calm,\nl
Its pose of ecstasy immutable.\nl
Plains lay that seemed the expanse of God's wide sleep,\nl
Thought's wings climbed up towards heaven's vast repose\nl
Lost in blue deeps of immortality.\nl
A changed earth-nature felt the breath of peace.\nl
Air seemed an ocean of felicity\nl
Or the couch of the unknown spiritual rest,\nl
A vast quiescence swallowing up all sound\nl
Into a voicelessness of utter bliss;\nl
Even Matter brought a close spiritual touch,\nl
All thrilled with the immanence of one divine.\nl
The lowest of these earths was still a heaven\nl
Translating into the splendour of things divine\nl
The beauty and brightness of terrestrial scenes.\nl
Page 672

Eternal mountains ridge on gleaming ridge\nl
Whose lines were graved as on a sapphire plate\nl
And etched the borders of heaven's lustrous noon\nl
Climbed like piled temple stairs and from their heads\nl
Of topless meditation heard below\nl
The approach of a blue pilgrim multitude\nl
And listened to a great arriving voice\nl
Of the wide travel hymn of timeless seas.\nl
A chanting crowd from mountain bosoms slipped\nl
Past branches fragrant with a sigh of flowers\nl
Hurrying through sweetnesses with revel leaps;\nl
The murmurous rivers of felicity\nl
Divinely rippled honey-voiced desires,\nl
Mingling their sister eddies of delight,\nl
Then, widening to a pace of calm-lipped muse,\nl
Down many-glimmered estuaries of dream\nl
Went whispering into lakes of liquid peace.\nl
On a brink held of senseless ecstasy\nl
And guarding an eternal poise of thought\nl
Sat sculptured souls dreaming by rivers of sound\nl
In changeless attitudes of marble bliss.\nl
Around her lived the children of God's day\nl
In an unspeakable felicity,\nl
A happiness never lost, the immortal's ease,\nl
A glad eternity's blissful multitude.\nl
Around, the deathless nations moved and spoke,\nl
Souls of a luminous celestial joy,\nl
Faces of stark beauty, limbs of the moulded Ray;\nl
In cities cut like gems of conscious stone\nl
And wonderful pastures and on gleaming coasts\nl
Bright forms were seen, eternity's luminous tribes.\nl
Above her rhythming godheads whirled the spheres,\nl
Rapt mobile fixities here blindly sought\nl
By the huge erring orbits of our stars.\nl
Ecstatic voices smote at hearing's chords,\nl
Each movement found a music all its own;\nl
Page 673

Songs thrilled of birds upon unfading boughs\nl
The colours of whose plumage had been caught\nl
From the rainbow of imagination's wings.\nl
Immortal fragrance packed the quivering breeze.\nl
In groves that seemed moved bosoms and trembling depths\nl
The million children of the undying spring\nl
Bloomed, pure unnumbered stars of hued delight\nl
Nestling for shelter in their emerald sky:\nl
Faery flower-masses looked with laughing eyes.\nl
A dancing chaos, an iridescent sea\nl
Eternised to Heaven's ever-wakeful sight\nl
The crowding petal-glow of marvel's tints\nl
Which float across the curtained lids of dream.\nl
Immortal harmonies filled her listening ear;\nl
A great spontaneous utterance of the heights\nl
On Titan wings of rhythmic grandeur borne\nl
Poured from some deep spiritual heart of sound,\nl
Strains trembling with the secrets of the gods.\nl
A spirit wandered happily in the wind,\nl
A spirit brooded in the leaf and stone;\nl
The voices of thought-conscious instruments\nl
Along a living verge of silence strayed,\nl
And from some deep, a wordless tongue of things\nl
Unfathomed, inexpressible, chantings rose\nl
Translating into a voice the Unknown.\nl
A climber on the invisible stair of sound,\nl
Music not with these few and striving steps\nl
Aspired that wander upon transient strings,\nl
But changed its ever new uncounted notes\nl
In a passion of unforeseeing discovery,\nl
And kept its old unforgotten ecstasies\nl
A growing treasure in the mystic heart.\nl
A consciousness that yearned through every cry\nl
Of unexplored attraction and desire,\nl
It found and searched again the unsatisfied deeps\nl
Hunting as if in some deep secret heart\nl
Page 674

To find some lost or missed felicity.\nl
In those far-lapsing symphonies she could hear,\nl
Breaking through enchantments of the ravished sense,\nl
The lyric voyage of a divine soul\nl
Mid spume and laughter tempting with its prow\nl
The charm of innocent Circean isles,\nl
Adventures without danger beautiful\nl
In lands where siren Wonder sings its lures\nl
From rhythmic rocks in ever-foaming seas.\nl
In the harmony of an original sight\nl
Delivered from our limiting ray of thought,\nl
And the reluctance of our blinded hearts\nl
To embrace the Godhead in whatever guise,\nl
She saw all Nature marvellous without fault.\nl
Invaded by beauty's universal revel\nl
Her being's fibre reached out vibrating\nl
And claimed deep union with its outer selves,\nl
And on the heart's chords made pure to seize all tones\nl
Heaven's subtleties of touch unwearying forced\nl
More vivid raptures than earth's life can bear.\nl
What would be suffering here, was fiery bliss.\nl
All here but passionate hint and mystic shade\nl
Divined by the inner prophet who perceives\nl
The spirit of delight in sensuous things,\nl
Turned to more sweetness than can now be dreamed.\nl
The mighty signs of which earth fears the stress,\nl
Trembling because she cannot understand,\nl
And must keep obscure in forms strange and sublime,\nl
Were here the first lexicon of an infinite mind\nl
Translating the language of eternal bliss.\nl
Here rapture was a common incident;\nl
The lovelinesses of whose captured thrill\nl
Our human pleasure is a fallen thread,\nl
Lay, symbol shapes, a careless ornament,\nl
Sewn on the rich brocade of Godhead's dress.\nl
Things fashioned were the imaged homes where mind\nl
Page 675

Arrived to fathom a deep physical joy;\nl
The heart was a torch lit from infinity,\nl
The limbs were trembling densities of soul.\nl
These were the first domains, the outer courts\nl
Immense but least in range and least in price,\nl
The slightest ecstasies of the undying gods.\nl
Higher her swing of vision swept and knew,\nl
Admitted through large sapphire opening gates\nl
Into the wideness of a light beyond,\nl
These were but sumptuous decorated doors\nl
To worlds nobler, more felicitously fair.\nl
Endless aspired the climbing of those heavens;\nl
Realm upon realm received her soaring view.\nl
Then on what seemed one crown of the ascent\nl
Where finite and the infinite are one,\nl
Immune she beheld the strong immortals' seats\nl
Who live for a celestial joy and rule,\nl
The middle regions of the unfading Ray.\nl
Great forms of deities sat in deathless tiers,\nl
Eyes of an unborn gaze towards her leaned\nl
Through a transparency of crystal fire.\nl
In the beauty of bodies wrought from rapture's lines,\nl
Shapes of entrancing sweetness spilling bliss,\nl
Feet glimmering upon the sunstone courts of mind,\nl
Heaven's cupbearers bore round the Eternal's wine.\nl
A tangle of bright bodies, of moved souls\nl
Tracing the close and intertwined delight,\nl
The harmonious tread of lives for ever joined\nl
In the passionate oneness of a mystic joy\nl
As if sunbeams made living and divine,\nl
The golden-bosomed Apsara goddesses,\nl
In groves flooded from an argent disk of bliss\nl
That floated through a luminous sapphire dream,\nl
In a cloud of raiment lit with golden limbs\nl
And gleaming footfalls treading faery swards,\nl
Virgin motions of bacchant innocences\nl
Page 676

Who know their riot for a dance of God,\nl
Whirled linked in moonlit revels of the heart.\nl
Impeccable artists of unerring forms,\nl
Magician builders of sound and rhythmic words,\nl
Wind-haired Gandharvas chanted to the ear\nl
The odes that shape the universal thought,\nl
The lines that tear the veil from Deity's face,\nl
The rhythms that bring the sounds of wisdom's sea.\nl
Immortal figures and illumined brows,\nl
Our great forefathers in those splendours moved;\nl
Termless in power and satisfied of light,\nl
They enjoyed the sense of all for which we strive.\nl
High seers, moved poets saw the eternal thoughts\nl
That, travellers from on high, arrive to us\nl
Deformed by our search, tricked by costuming mind,\nl
Like gods disfigured by the pangs of birth,\nl
Seized the great words which now are frail sounds caught\nl
By difficult rapture on a mortal tongue.\nl
The strong who stumble and sin were calm proud gods.\nl
There lightning-filled with glory and with flame,\nl
Melting in waves of sympathy and sight,\nl
Smitten like a lyre that throbs to others' bliss,\nl
Drawn by the cords of ecstasies unknown,\nl
Her human nature faint with heaven's delight,\nl
She beheld the clasp to earth denied and bore\nl
The imperishable eyes of veilless love.\nl
More climbed above, level to level reached,\nl
Beyond what tongue can utter or mind dream:\nl
Worlds of an infinite reach crowned Nature's stir.\nl
There was a greater tranquil sweetness there,\nl
A subtler and profounder ether's field\nl
And mightier scheme than heavenliest sense can give.\nl
There breath carried a stream of seeing mind,\nl
Form was a tenuous raiment of the soul:\nl
Colour was a visible tone of ecstasy;\nl
Shapes seen half immaterial by the gaze\nl
Page 677

And yet voluptuously palpable\nl
Made sensible to touch the indwelling spirit.\nl
The high perfected sense illumined lived\nl
A happy vassal of the inner ray,\nl
Each feeling was the Eternal's mighty child\nl
And every thought was a sweet burning god.\nl
Air was a luminous feeling, sound a voice,\nl
Sunlight the soul's vision and moonlight its dream.\nl
On a wide living base of wordless calm\nl
All was a potent and a lucid joy.\nl
Into those heights her spirit went floating up\nl
Like an upsoaring bird who mounts unseen\nl
Voicing to the ascent his throbbing heart\nl
Of melody till a pause of closing wings\nl
Comes quivering in his last contented cry\nl
And he is silent with his soul discharged,\nl
Delivered of his heart's burden of delight.\nl
Experience mounted on joy's coloured breast\nl
To inaccessible spheres in spiral flight.\nl
There Time dwelt with eternity as one;\nl
Immense felicity joined rapt repose.\nl

\spar As one drowned in a sea of splendour and bliss,\nl
Mute in the maze of these surprising worlds,\nl
Turning she saw their living knot and source,\nl
Key to their charm and fount of their delight,\nl
And knew him for the same who snares our lives\nl
Captured in his terrifying pitiless net,\nl
And makes the universe his prison camp\nl
And makes in his immense and vacant vasts\nl
The labour of the stars a circuit vain\nl
And death the end of every human road\nl
And grief and pain the wages of man's toil.\nl
One whom her soul had faced as Death and Night\nl
A sum of all sweetness gathered into his limbs\nl
And blinded her heart to the beauty of the suns.\nl
Page 678

Transfigured was the formidable shape.\nl
His darkness and his sad destroying might\nl
Abolishing for ever and disclosing\nl
The mystery of his high and violent deeds,\nl
A secret splendour rose revealed to sight\nl
Where once the vast embodied Void had stood.\nl
Night the dim mask had grown a wonderful face.\nl
The vague infinity was slain whose gloom\nl
Had outlined from the terrible unknown\nl
The obscure disastrous figure of a god,\nl
Fled was the error that arms the hands of grief,\nl
And lighted the ignorant gulf whose hollow deeps\nl
Had given to nothingness a dreadful voice.\nl
As when before the eye that wakes in sleep\nl
Is opened the sombre binding of a book,\nl
Illumined letterings are seen which kept\nl
A golden blaze of thought inscribed within,\nl
A marvellous form responded to her gaze\nl
Whose sweetness justified life's blindest pain;\nl
All Nature's struggle was its easy price,\nl
The universe and its agony seemed worth while.\nl
As if the choric calyx of a flower\nl
Aerial, visible on music's waves,\nl
A lotus of light-petalled ecstasy\nl
Took shape out of the tremulous heart of things.\nl
There was no more the torment under the stars,\nl
The evil sheltered behind Nature's mask;\nl
There was no more the dark pretence of hate,\nl
The cruel rictus on Love's altered face.\nl
Hate was the grip of a dreadful amour's strife;\nl
A ruthless love intent only to possess\nl
Has here replaced the sweet original god.\nl
Forgetting the Will-to-love that gave it birth,\nl
The passion to lock itself in and to unite,\nl
It would swallow all into one lonely self,\nl
Devouring the soul that it had made its own,\nl
Page 679

By suffering and annihilation's pain\nl
Punishing the unwillingness to be one,\nl
Angry with the refusals of the world,\nl
Passionate to take but knowing not how to give.\nl
Death's sombre cowl was cast from Nature's brow;\nl
There lightened on her the godhead's lurking laugh.\nl
All grace and glory and all divinity\nl
Were here collected in a single form;\nl
All worshipped eyes looked through his from one face;\nl
He bore all godheads in his grandiose limbs.\nl
An oceanic spirit dwelt within;\nl
Intolerant and invincible in joy\nl
A flood of freedom and transcendent bliss\nl
Into immortal lines of beauty rose.\nl
In him the fourfold Being bore its crown\nl
That wears the mystery of a nameless Name,\nl
The universe writing its tremendous sense\nl
In the inexhaustible meaning of a word.\nl
In him the architect of the visible world,\nl
At once the art and artist of his works,\nl
Spirit and seer and thinker of things seen,\nl
Virat, who lights his camp-fires in the suns\nl
And the star-entangled ether is his hold,\nl
Expressed himself with Matter for his speech:\nl
Objects are his letters, forces are his words,\nl
Events are the crowded history of his life,\nl
And sea and land are the pages for his tale.\nl
Matter is his means and his spiritual sign;\nl
He hangs the thought upon a lash's lift,\nl
In the current of the blood makes flow the soul.\nl
His is the dumb will of atom and of clod;\nl
A Will that without sense or motive acts,\nl
An Intelligence needing not to think or plan,\nl
The world creates itself invincibly;\nl
For its body is the body of the Lord\nl
And in its heart stands Virat, King of Kings.\nl
Page 680

In him shadows his form the Golden Child\nl
Who in the Sun-capped Vast cradles his birth:\nl
Hiranyagarbha, author of thoughts and dreams,\nl
Who sees the invisible and hears the sounds\nl
That never visited a mortal ear,\nl
Discoverer of unthought realities\nl
Truer to Truth than all we have ever known,\nl
He is the leader on the inner roads;\nl
A seer, he has entered the forbidden realms;\nl
A magician with the omnipotent wand of thought,\nl
He builds the secret uncreated worlds.\nl
Armed with the golden speech, the diamond eye,\nl
His is the vision and the prophecy:\nl
Imagist casting the formless into shape,\nl
Traveller and hewer of the unseen paths,\nl
He is the carrier of the hidden fire,\nl
He is the voice of the Ineffable,\nl
He is the invisible hunter of the light,\nl
The Angel of mysterious ecstasies,\nl
The conqueror of the kingdoms of the soul.\nl
A third spirit stood behind, their hidden cause,\nl
A mass of superconscience closed in light,\nl
Creator of things in his all-knowing sleep.\nl
All from his stillness came as grows a tree;\nl
He is our seed and core, our head and base.\nl
All light is but a flash from his closed eyes:\nl
An all-wise Truth is mystic in his heart,\nl
The omniscient Ray is shut behind his lids:\nl
He is the Wisdom that comes not by thought,\nl
His wordless silence brings the immortal word.\nl
He sleeps in the atom and the burning star,\nl
He sleeps in man and god and beast and stone:\nl
Because he is there the Inconscient does its work,\nl
Because he is there the world forgets to die.\nl
He is the centre of the circle of God,\nl
He the circumference of Nature's run.\nl
Page 681

His slumber is an Almightiness in things,\nl
Awake, he is the Eternal and Supreme.\nl
Above was the brooding bliss of the Infinite,\nl
Its omniscient and omnipotent repose,\nl
Its immobile silence absolute and alone.\nl
All powers were woven in countless concords here.\nl
The bliss that made the world in his body lived,\nl
Love and delight were the head of the sweet form.\nl
In the alluring meshes of their snare\nl
Recaptured, the proud blissful members held\nl
All joys outrunners of the panting heart\nl
And fugitive from life's outstripped desire.\nl
Whatever vision has escaped the eye,\nl
Whatever happiness comes in dream and trance,\nl
The nectar spilled by love with trembling hands,\nl
The joy the cup of Nature cannot hold,\nl
Had crowded to the beauty of his face,\nl
Were waiting in the honey of his laugh.\nl
Things hidden by the silence of the hours,\nl
The ideas that find no voice on living lips,\nl
The soul's pregnant meeting with infinity\nl
Had come to birth in him and taken fire:\nl
The secret whisper of the flower and star\nl
Revealed its meaning in his fathomless look.\nl
His lips curved eloquent like a rose of dawn;\nl
His smile that played with the wonder of the mind\nl
And stayed in the heart when it had left his mouth\nl
Glimmered with the radiance of the morning star\nl
Gemming the wide discovery of heaven.\nl
His gaze was the regard of eternity;\nl
The spirit of its sweet and calm intent\nl
Was a wise home of gladness and divulged\nl
The light of the ages in the mirth of the hours,\nl
A sun of wisdom in a miracled grove.\nl
In the orchestral largeness of his mind\nl
All contrary seekings their close kinship knew,\nl
Page 682

Rich-hearted, wonderful to each other met\nl
In the mutual marvelling of their myriad notes\nl
And dwelt like brothers of one family\nl
Who had found their common and mysterious home.\nl
As from the harp of some ecstatic god\nl
There springs a harmony of lyric bliss\nl
Striving to leave no heavenly joy unsung,\nl
Such was the life in that embodied Light.\nl
He seemed the wideness of a boundless sky,\nl
He seemed the passion of a sorrowless earth,\nl
He seemed the burning of a world-wide sun.\nl
Two looked upon each other, Soul saw Soul.\nl

\spar Then like an anthem from the heart's lucent cave\nl
A voice soared up whose magic sound could turn\nl
The poignant weeping of the earth to sobs\nl
Of rapture and her cry to spirit song.\nl
“O human image of the deathless word,\nl
How hast thou seen beyond the topaz walls\nl
The gleaming sisters of the divine gate,\nl
Summoned the genii of their wakeful sleep,\nl
And under revelation's arches forced\nl
The carved thought-shrouded doors to swing apart,\nl
Unlocked the avenues of spiritual sight\nl
And taught the entries of a heavenlier state\nl
To thy rapt soul that bore the golden key?\nl
In thee the secret sight man's blindness missed\nl
Has opened its view past Time, my chariot-course,\nl
And death, my tunnel which I drive through life\nl
To reach my unseen distances of bliss.\nl
I am the hushed search of the jealous gods\nl
Pursuing my wisdom's vast mysterious work\nl
Seized in the thousand meeting ways of heaven.\nl
I am the beauty of the unveiled ray\nl
Drawing through the deep roads of the infinite night\nl
The unconquerable pilgrim soul of earth\nl
Page 683

Beneath the flaring torches of the stars.\nl
I am the inviolable Ecstasy;\nl
They who have looked on me, shall grieve no more.\nl
The eyes that live in night shall see my form.\nl
On the pale shores of foaming steely straits\nl
That flow beneath a grey tormented sky,\nl
Two powers from one original ecstasy born\nl
Pace near but parted in the life of man;\nl
One leans to earth, the other yearns to the skies:\nl
Heaven in its rapture dreams of perfect earth,\nl
Earth in its sorrow dreams of perfect heaven.\nl
The two longing to join, yet walk apart,\nl
Idly divided by their vain conceits;\nl
They are kept from their oneness by enchanted fears;\nl
Sundered mysteriously by miles of thought,\nl
They gaze across the silent gulfs of sleep.\nl
Or side by side reclined upon my vasts\nl
Like bride and bridegroom magically divorced\nl
They wake to yearn, but never can they clasp\nl
While thinly flickering hesitates uncrossed\nl
Between the lovers on their nuptial couch\nl
The shadowy eidolon of a sword.\nl
But when the phantom flame-edge fails undone,\nl
Then never more can space or time divide\nl
The lover from the loved; Space shall draw back\nl
Her great translucent curtain, Time shall be\nl
The quivering of the spirit's endless bliss.\nl
Attend that moment of celestial fate.\nl
Meanwhile you two shall serve the dual law\nl
Which only now the scouts of vision glimpse\nl
Who pressing through the forest of their thoughts\nl
Have found the narrow bridges of the gods.\nl
Wait patient of the brittle bars of form\nl
Making division your delightful means\nl
Of happy oneness rapturously enhanced\nl
By attraction in the throbbing air between.\nl
Page 684

Yet if thou wouldst abandon the vexed world,\nl
Careless of the dark moan of things below,\nl
Tread down the isthmus, overleap the flood,\nl
Cancel thy contract with the labouring Force;\nl
Renounce the tie that joins thee to earth-kind,\nl
Cast off thy sympathy with mortal hearts.\nl
Arise, vindicate thy spirit's conquered right:\nl
Relinquishing thy charge of transient breath,\nl
Under the cold gaze of the indifferent stars\nl
Leaving thy borrowed body on the sod,\nl
Ascend, O soul, into thy blissful home.\nl
Here in the playground of the eternal Child\nl
Or in domains the wise Immortals tread\nl
Roam with thy comrade splendour under skies\nl
Spiritual lit by an unsetting sun,\nl
As godheads live who care not for the world\nl
And share not in the toil of Nature's powers:\nl
Absorbed in their self-ecstasy they dwell.\nl
Cast off the ambiguous myth of earth's desire,\nl
O immortal, to felicity arise.”\nl
\sparn On Savitri listening in her tranquil heart\nl
To the harmony of the ensnaring voice\nl
A joy exceeding earth's and heaven's poured down,\nl
The bliss of an unknown eternity,\nl
A rapture from some waiting Infinite.\nl
A smile came rippling out in her wide eyes,\nl
Its confident felicity's messenger\nl
As if the first beam of the morning sun\nl
Rippled along two wakened lotus-pools.\nl
“O besetter of man's soul with life and death\nl
And the world's pleasure and pain and Day and Night,\nl
Tempting his heart with the far lure of heaven,\nl
Testing his strength with the close touch of hell,\nl
I climb not to thy everlasting Day,\nl
Even as I have shunned thy eternal Night.\nl
To me who turn not from thy terrestrial Way,\nl
Page 685

Give back the other self my nature asks.\nl
Thy spaces need him not to help their joy;\nl
Earth needs his beautiful spirit made by thee\nl
To fling delight down like a net of gold.\nl
Earth is the chosen place of mightiest souls;\nl
Earth is the heroic spirit's battlefield,\nl
The forge where the Archmason shapes his works.\nl
Thy servitudes on earth are greater, King,\nl
Than all the glorious liberties of heaven.\nl
The heavens were once to me my natural home,\nl
I too have wandered in star-jewelled groves,\nl
Paced sun-gold pastures and moon-silver swards\nl
And heard the harping laughter of their streams\nl
And lingered under branches dropping myrrh;\nl
I too have revelled in the fields of light\nl
Touched by the ethereal raiment of the winds,\nl
Thy wonder-rounds of music I have trod,\nl
Lived in the rhyme of bright unlabouring thoughts,\nl
I have beat swift harmonies of rapture vast,\nl
Danced in spontaneous measures of the soul\nl
The great and easy dances of the gods.\nl
O fragrant are the lanes thy children walk\nl
And lovely is the memory of their feet\nl
Amid the wonder-flowers of Paradise:\nl
A heavier tread is mine, a mightier touch.\nl
There where the gods and demons battle in night\nl
Or wrestle on the borders of the Sun,\nl
Taught by the sweetness and the pain of life\nl
To bear the uneven strenuous beat that throbs\nl
Against the edge of some divinest hope,\nl
To dare the impossible with these pangs of search,\nl
In me the spirit of immortal love\nl
Stretches its arms out to embrace mankind.\nl
Too far thy heavens for me from suffering men.\nl
Imperfect is the joy not shared by all.\nl
O to spread forth, O to encircle and seize\nl
Page 686

More hearts till love in us has filled thy world!\nl
O life, the life beneath the wheeling stars!\nl
For victory in the tournament with death,\nl
For bending of the fierce and difficult bow,\nl
For flashing of the splendid sword of God!\nl
O thou who soundst the trumpet in the lists,\nl
Part not the handle from the untried steel,\nl
Take not the warrior with his blow unstruck.\nl
Are there not still a million fights to wage?\nl
O king-smith, clang on still thy toil begun,\nl
Weld us to one in thy strong smithy of life.\nl
Thy fine-curved jewelled hilt call Savitri,\nl
Thy blade's exultant smile name Satyavan.\nl
Fashion to beauty, point us through the world.\nl
Break not the lyre before the song is found;\nl
Are there not still unnumbered chants to weave?\nl
O subtle-souled musician of the years,\nl
Play out what thou hast fluted on my stops;\nl
Arise from the strain their first wild plaint divined\nl
And that discover which is yet unsung.\nl
I know that I can lift man's soul to God,\nl
I know that he can bring the Immortal down.\nl
Our will labours permitted by thy will\nl
And without thee an empty roar of storm,\nl
A senseless whirlwind is the Titan's force\nl
And without thee a snare the strength of gods.\nl
Let not the inconscient gulf swallow man's race\nl
That through earth's ignorance struggles towards thy Light.\nl
O Thunderer with the lightnings of the soul,\nl
Give not to darkness and to death thy sun,\nl
Achieve thy wisdom's hidden firm decree\nl
And the mandate of thy secret world-wide love.”\nl
Her words failed lost in thought's immensities\nl
Which seized them at the limits of their cry\nl
And hid their meaning in the distances\nl
That stir to more than ever speech has won\nl
Page 687

From the Unthinkable, end of all our thought,\nl
And the Ineffable from whom all words come.\nl

\spar Then with a smile august as noonday heavens\nl
The godhead of the vision wonderful:\nl
“How shall earth-nature and man's nature rise\nl
To the celestial levels, yet earth abide?\nl
Heaven and earth towards each other gaze\nl
Across a gulf that few can cross, none touch,\nl
Arriving through a vague ethereal mist\nl
Out of which all things form that move in space,\nl
The shore that all can see but never reach.\nl
Heaven's light visits sometimes the mind of earth;\nl
Its thoughts burn in her sky like lonely stars;\nl
In her heart there move celestial seekings soft\nl
And beautiful like fluttering wings of birds,\nl
Visions of joy that she can never win\nl
Traverse the fading mirror of her dreams.\nl
Faint seeds of light and bliss bear sorrowful flowers,\nl
Faint harmonies caught from a half-heard song\nl
Fall swooning mid the wandering voices' jar,\nl
Foam from the tossing luminous seas where dwells\nl
The beautiful and far delight of gods,\nl
Raptures unknown, a miracled happiness\nl
Thrill her and pass half-shaped to mind and sense.\nl
Above her little finite steps she feels,\nl
Careless of knot or pause, worlds which weave out\nl
A strange perfection beyond law and rule,\nl
A universe of self-found felicity,\nl
An inexpressible rhythm of timeless beats,\nl
The many-movemented heart-beats of the One,\nl
Magic of the boundless harmonies of self,\nl
Order of the freedom of the infinite,\nl
The wonder-plastics of the Absolute.\nl
There is the All-Truth and there the timeless bliss.\nl
But hers are fragments of a star-lost gleam,\nl
Page 688

Hers are but careless visits of the gods.\nl
They are a Light that fails, a Word soon hushed\nl
And nothing they mean can stay for long on earth.\nl
There are high glimpses, not the lasting sight.\nl
A few can climb to an unperishing sun,\nl
Or live on the edges of the mystic moon\nl
And channel to earth-mind the wizard ray.\nl
The heroes and the demigods are few\nl
To whom the close immortal voices speak\nl
And to their acts the heavenly clan are near.\nl
Few are the silences in which Truth is heard,\nl
Unveiling the timeless utterance in her deeps;\nl
Few are the splendid moments of the seers.\nl
Heaven's call is rare, rarer the heart that heeds;\nl
The doors of light are sealed to common mind\nl
And earth's needs nail to earth the human mass,\nl
Only in an uplifting hour of stress\nl
Men answer to the touch of greater things:\nl
Or, raised by some strong hand to breathe heaven-air,\nl
They slide back to the mud from which they climbed;\nl
In the mud of which they are made, whose law they know\nl
They joy in safe return to a friendly base,\nl
And, though something in them weeps for glory lost\nl
And greatness murdered, they accept their fall.\nl
To be the common man they think the best,\nl
To live as others live is their delight.\nl
For most are built on Nature's early plan\nl
And owe small debt to a superior plane;\nl
The human average is their level pitch,\nl
A thinking animal's material range.\nl
In the long ever-mounting hierarchy,\nl
In the stark economy of cosmic life\nl
Each creature to its appointed task and place\nl
Is bound by his nature's form, his spirit's force.\nl
If this were easily disturbed, it would break\nl
The settled balance of created things;\nl
Page 689

The perpetual order of the universe\nl
Would tremble, and a gap yawn in woven Fate.\nl
If men were not and all were brilliant gods,\nl
The mediating stair would then be lost\nl
By which the spirit awake in Matter winds\nl
Accepting the circuits of the middle Way,\nl
By heavy toil and slow aeonic steps\nl
Reaching the bright miraculous fringe of God,\nl
Into the glory of the Oversoul.\nl
My will, my call is there in men and things;\nl
But the Inconscient lies at the world's grey back\nl
And draws to its breast of Night and Death and Sleep.\nl
Imprisoned in its dark and dumb abyss\nl
A little consciousness it lets escape\nl
But jealous of the growing light holds back\nl
Close to the obscure edges of its cave\nl
As if a fond ignorant mother kept her child\nl
Tied to her apron strings of Nescience.\nl
The Inconscient could not read without man's mind\nl
The mystery of the world its sleep has made:\nl
Man is its key to unlock a conscious door.\nl
But still it holds him dangled in its grasp:\nl
It draws its giant circle round his thoughts,\nl
It shuts his heart to the supernal Light.\nl
A high and dazzling limit shines above,\nl
A black and blinding border rules below:\nl
His mind is closed between two firmaments.\nl
He seeks through words and images the Truth,\nl
And, poring on surfaces and brute outsides\nl
Or dipping cautious feet in shallow seas,\nl
Even his Knowledge is an Ignorance.\nl
He is barred out from his own inner depths;\nl
He cannot look on the face of the Unknown.\nl
How shall he see with the Omniscient's eyes,\nl
How shall he will with the Omnipotent's force?\nl
O too compassionate and eager Dawn,\nl
Page 690

Leave to the circling aeons' tardy pace\nl
And to the working of the inconscient Will,\nl
Leave to its imperfect light the earthly race:\nl
All shall be done by the long act of Time.\nl
Although the race is bound by its own kind,\nl
The soul in man is greater than his fate:\nl
Above the wash and surge of Time and Space,\nl
Disengaging from the cosmic commonalty\nl
By which all life is kin in grief and joy,\nl
Delivered from the universal Law\nl
The sunlike single and transcendent spirit\nl
Can blaze its way through the mind's barrier wall\nl
And burn alone in the eternal sky,\nl
Inhabitant of a wide and endless calm.\nl
O flame, withdraw into thy luminous self.\nl
Or else return to thy original might\nl
On a seer-summit above thought and world;\nl
Partner of my unhoured eternity,\nl
Be one with the infinity of my power:\nl
For thou art the World-Mother and the Bride.\nl
Out of the fruitless yearning of earth's life,\nl
Out of her feeble unconvincing dream,\nl
Recovering wings that cross infinity\nl
Pass back into the Power from which thou cam'st.\nl
To that thou canst uplift thy formless flight,\nl
Thy heart can rise from its unsatisfied beats\nl
And feel the immortal and spiritual joy\nl
Of a soul that never lost felicity.\nl
Lift up the fallen heart of love which flutters\nl
Cast down desire's abyss into the gulfs.\nl
For ever rescued out of Nature's shapes\nl
Discover what the aimless cycles want,\nl
There intertwined with all thy life has meant,\nl
Here vainly sought in a terrestrial form.\nl
Break into eternity thy mortal mould;\nl
Melt, lightning, into thy invisible flame!\nl
Page 691

Clasp, Ocean, deep into thyself thy wave,\nl
Happy for ever in the embosoming surge.\nl
Grow one with the still passion of the depths.\nl
Then shalt thou know the Lover and the Loved,\nl
Leaving the limits dividing him and thee.\nl
Receive him into boundless Savitri,\nl
Lose thyself into infinite Satyavan.\nl
O miracle, where thou beganst, there cease!”\nl
\sparn But Savitri answered to the radiant God:\nl
“In vain thou temptst with solitary bliss\nl
Two spirits saved out of a suffering world;\nl
My soul and his indissolubly linked\nl
In the one task for which our lives were born,\nl
To raise the world to God in deathless Light,\nl
To bring God down to the world on earth we came,\nl
To change the earthly life to life divine.\nl
I keep my will to save the world and man;\nl
Even the charm of thy alluring voice,\nl
O blissful Godhead, cannot seize and snare.\nl
I sacrifice not earth to happier worlds.\nl
Because there dwelt the Eternal's vast Idea\nl
And his dynamic will in men and things,\nl
So only could the enormous scene begin.\nl
Whence came this profitless wilderness of stars,\nl
This mighty barren wheeling of the suns?\nl
Who made the soul of futile life in Time,\nl
Planted a purpose and a hope in the heart,\nl
Set Nature to a huge and meaningless task\nl
Or planned her million-aeoned effort's waste?\nl
What force condemned to birth and death and tears\nl
These conscious creatures crawling on the globe?\nl
If earth can look up to the light of heaven\nl
And hear an answer to her lonely cry,\nl
Not vain their meeting, nor heaven's touch a snare.\nl
If thou and I are true, the world is true;\nl
Although thou hide thyself behind thy works,\nl
Page 692

To be is not a senseless paradox;\nl
Since God has made earth, earth must make in her God;\nl
What hides within her breast she must reveal.\nl
I claim thee for the world that thou hast made.\nl
If man lives bound by his humanity,\nl
If he is tied for ever to his pain,\nl
Let a greater being then arise from man,\nl
The superhuman with the Eternal mate\nl
And the Immortal shine through earthly forms.\nl
Else were creation vain and this great world\nl
A nothing that in Time's moments seems to be.\nl
But I have seen through the insentient mask;\nl
I have felt a secret spirit stir in things\nl
Carrying the body of the growing God:\nl
It looks through veiling forms at veilless truth;\nl
It pushes back the curtain of the gods;\nl
It climbs towards its own eternity.”\nl
But the god answered to the woman's heart:\nl
“O living power of the incarnate Word,\nl
All that the Spirit has dreamed thou canst create:\nl
Thou art the force by which I made the worlds,\nl
Thou art my vision and my will and voice.\nl
But knowledge too is thine, the world-plan thou knowest\nl
And the tardy process of the pace of Time.\nl
In the impetuous drive of thy heart of flame,\nl
In thy passion to deliver man and earth,\nl
Indignant at the impediments of Time\nl
And the slow evolution's sluggard steps,\nl
Lead not the spirit in an ignorant world\nl
To dare too soon the adventure of the Light,\nl
Pushing the bound and slumbering god in man\nl
Awakened mid the ineffable silences\nl
Into endless vistas of the unknown and unseen,\nl
Across the last confines of the limiting Mind\nl
And the Superconscient's perilous border line\nl
Into the danger of the Infinite.\nl
Page 693

But if thou wilt not wait for Time and God,\nl
Do then thy work and force thy will on Fate.\nl
As I have taken from thee my load of night\nl
And taken from thee my twilight's doubts and dreams,\nl
So now I take my light of utter Day.\nl
These are my symbol kingdoms but not here\nl
Can the great choice be made that fixes fate\nl
Or uttered the sanction of the Voice supreme.\nl
Arise upon a ladder of greater worlds\nl
To the infinity where no world can be.\nl
But not in the wide air where a greater Life\nl
Uplifts its mystery and its miracle,\nl
And not on the luminous peaks of summit Mind,\nl
Or in the hold where subtle Matter's spirit\nl
Hides in its light of shimmering secrecies,\nl
Can there be heard the Eternal's firm command\nl
That joins the head of destiny to its base.\nl
These only are the mediating links;\nl
Not theirs is the originating sight\nl
Nor the fulfilling act or last support\nl
That bears perpetually the cosmic pile.\nl
Two are the Powers that hold the ends of Time;\nl
Spirit foresees, Matter unfolds its thought,\nl
The dumb executor of God's decrees,\nl
Omitting no iota and no dot,\nl
Agent unquestioning, inconscient, stark,\nl
Evolving inevitably a charged content,\nl
Intention of his force in Time and Space,\nl
In animate beings and inanimate things;\nl
Immutably it fulfils its ordered task,\nl
It cancels not a tittle of things done;\nl
Unswerving from the oracular command\nl
It alters not the steps of the Unseen.\nl
If thou must indeed deliver man and earth\nl
On the spiritual heights look down on life,\nl
Discover the truth of God and man and world;\nl
Page 694

Then do thy task knowing and seeing all.\nl
Ascend, O soul, into thy timeless self;\nl
Choose destiny's curve and stamp thy will on Time.”\nl
He ended and upon the falling sound\nl
A power went forth that shook the founded spheres\nl
And loosed the stakes that hold the tents of form.\nl
Absolved from vision's grip and the folds of thought,\nl
Rapt from her sense like disappearing scenes\nl
In the stupendous theatre of Space\nl
The heaven-worlds vanished in spiritual light.\nl
A movement was abroad, a cry, a word,\nl
Beginningless in its vast discovery,\nl
Momentless in its unthinkable return:\nl
Choired in calm seas she heard the eternal Thought\nl
Rhythming itself abroad unutterably\nl
In spaceless orbits and on timeless roads.\nl
In an ineffable world she lived fulfilled.\nl
An energy of the triune Infinite,\nl
In a measureless Reality she dwelt,\nl
A rapture and a being and a force,\nl
A linked and myriad-motioned plenitude,\nl
A virgin unity, a luminous spouse,\nl
Housing a multitudinous embrace\nl
To marry all in God's immense delight,\nl
Bearing the eternity of every spirit,\nl
Bearing the burden of universal love,\nl
A wonderful mother of unnumbered souls.\nl
All things she knew, all things imagined or willed:\nl
Her ear was opened to ideal sound,\nl
Shape the convention bound no more her sight,\nl
A thousand doors of oneness was her heart.\nl
A crypt and sanctuary of brooding light\nl
Appeared, the last recess of things beyond.\nl
Then in its rounds the enormous fiat paused,\nl
Silence gave back to the Unknowable\nl
All it had given. Still was her listening thought.\nl
Page 695

The form of things had ceased within her soul.\nl
Invisible that perfect godhead now.\nl
Around her some tremendous spirit lived,\nl
Mysterious flame around a melting pearl,\nl
And in the phantom of abolished Space\nl
There was a voice unheard by ears that cried:\nl
“Choose, spirit, thy supreme choice not given again;\nl
For now from my highest being looks at thee\nl
The nameless formless peace where all things rest.\nl
In a happy vast sublime cessation know,—\nl
An immense extinction in eternity,\nl
A point that disappears in the infinite,—\nl
Felicity of the extinguished flame,\nl
Last sinking of a wave in a boundless sea,\nl
End of the trouble of thy wandering thoughts,\nl
Close of the journeying of thy pilgrim soul.\nl
Accept, O music, weariness of thy notes,\nl
O stream, wide breaking of thy channel banks.”\nl
The moments fell into eternity.\nl
But someone yearned within a bosom unknown\nl
And silently the woman's heart replied:\nl
“Thy peace, O Lord, a boon within to keep\nl
Amid the roar and ruin of wild Time\nl
For the magnificent soul of man on earth.\nl
Thy calm, O Lord, that bears thy hands of joy.”\nl
Limitless like ocean round a lonely isle\nl
A second time the eternal cry arose:\nl
“Wide open are the ineffable gates in front.\nl
My spirit leans down to break the knot of earth,\nl
Amorous of oneness without thought or sign\nl
To cast down wall and fence, to strip heaven bare,\nl
See with the large eye of infinity,\nl
Unweave the stars and into silence pass.”\nl
In an immense and world-destroying pause\nl
She heard a million creatures cry to her.\nl
Through the tremendous stillness of her thoughts\nl
Page 696

Immeasurably the woman's nature spoke:\nl
“Thy oneness, Lord, in many approaching hearts,\nl
My sweet infinity of thy numberless souls.”\nl
Mightily retreating like a sea in ebb\nl
A third time swelled the great admonishing call:\nl
“I spread abroad the refuge of my wings.\nl
Out of its incommunicable deeps\nl
My power looks forth of mightiest splendour, stilled\nl
Into its majesty of sleep, withdrawn\nl
Above the dreadful whirlings of the world.”\nl
A sob of things was answer to the voice,\nl
And passionately the woman's heart replied:\nl
“Thy energy, Lord, to seize on woman and man,\nl
To take all things and creatures in their grief\nl
And gather them into a mother's arms.”\nl
Solemn and distant like a seraph's lyre\nl
A last great time the warning sound was heard:\nl
“I open the wide eye of solitude\nl
To uncover the voiceless rapture of my bliss,\nl
Where in a pure and exquisite hush it lies\nl
Motionless in its slumber of ecstasy,\nl
Resting from the sweet madness of the dance\nl
Out of whose beat the throb of hearts was born.”\nl
Breaking the Silence with appeal and cry\nl
A hymn of adoration tireless climbed,\nl
A music beat of winged uniting souls,\nl
Then all the woman yearningly replied:\nl
“Thy embrace which rends the living knot of pain,\nl
Thy joy, O Lord, in which all creatures breathe,\nl
Thy magic flowing waters of deep love,\nl
Thy sweetness give to me for earth and men.”\nl

\spar Then after silence a still blissful cry\nl
Began, such as arose from the Infinite\nl
When the first whisperings of a strange delight\nl
Imagined in its deep the joy to seek,\nl
Page 697

The passion to discover and to touch,\nl
The enamoured laugh which rhymed the chanting worlds:\nl
“O beautiful body of the incarnate Word,\nl
Thy thoughts are mine, I have spoken with thy voice.\nl
My will is thine, what thou hast chosen I choose:\nl
All thou hast asked I give to earth and men.\nl
All shall be written out in destiny's book\nl
By my trustee of thought and plan and act,\nl
The executor of my will, eternal Time.\nl
But since thou hast refused my maimless Calm\nl
And turned from my termless peace in which is expunged\nl
The visage of Space and the shape of Time is lost,\nl
And from happy extinction of thy separate self\nl
In my uncompanioned lone eternity,—\nl
For not for thee the nameless worldless Nought,\nl
Annihilation of thy living soul\nl
And the end of thought and hope and life and love\nl
In the blank measureless Unknowable,—\nl
I lay my hands upon thy soul of flame,\nl
I lay my hands upon thy heart of love,\nl
I yoke thee to my power of work in Time.\nl
Because thou hast obeyed my timeless will,\nl
Because thou hast chosen to share earth's struggle and fate\nl
And leaned in pity over earth-bound men\nl
And turned aside to help and yearned to save,\nl
I bind by thy heart's passion thy heart to mine\nl
And lay my splendid yoke upon thy soul.\nl
Now will I do in thee my marvellous works.\nl
I will fasten thy nature with my cords of strength,\nl
Subdue to my delight thy spirit's limbs\nl
And make thee a vivid knot of all my bliss\nl
And build in thee my proud and crystal home.\nl
Thy days shall be my shafts of power and light,\nl
Thy nights my starry mysteries of joy\nl
And all my clouds lie tangled in thy hair\nl
And all my springtides marry in thy mouth.\nl
Page 698

O Sun-Word, thou shalt raise the earth-soul to Light\nl
And bring down God into the lives of men;\nl
Earth shall be my work-chamber and my house,\nl
My garden of life to plant a seed divine.\nl
When all thy work in human time is done\nl
The mind of earth shall be a home of light,\nl
The life of earth a tree growing towards heaven,\nl
The body of earth a tabernacle of God.\nl
Awakened from the mortal's ignorance\nl
Men shall be lit with the Eternal's ray\nl
And the glory of my sun-lift in their thoughts\nl
And feel in their hearts the sweetness of my love\nl
And in their acts my Power's miraculous drive.\nl
My will shall be the meaning of their days;\nl
Living for me, by me, in me they shall live.\nl
In the heart of my creation's mystery\nl
I will enact the drama of thy soul,\nl
Inscribe the long romance of Thee and Me.\nl
I will pursue thee across the centuries;\nl
Thou shalt be hunted through the world by love,\nl
Naked of ignorance' protecting veil\nl
And without covert from my radiant gods.\nl
No shape shall screen thee from my divine desire,\nl
Nowhere shalt thou escape my living eyes.\nl
In the nudity of thy discovered self,\nl
In a bare identity with all that is,\nl
Disrobed of thy covering of humanity,\nl
Divested of the dense veil of human thought,\nl
Made one with every mind and body and heart,\nl
Made one with all Nature and with Self and God,\nl
Summing in thy single soul my mystic world\nl
I will possess in thee my universe,\nl
The universe find all I am in thee.\nl
Thou shalt bear all things that all things may change,\nl
Thou shalt fill all with my splendour and my bliss,\nl
Thou shalt meet all with thy transmuting soul.\nl
Page 699

Assailed by my infinitudes above,\nl
And quivering in immensities below,\nl
Pursued by me through my mind's wall-less vast,\nl
Oceanic with the surges of my life,\nl
A swimmer lost between two leaping seas\nl
By my outer pains and inner sweetnesses\nl
Finding my joy in my opposite mysteries\nl
Thou shalt respond to me from every nerve.\nl
A vision shall compel thy coursing breath,\nl
Thy heart shall drive thee on the wheel of works,\nl
Thy mind shall urge thee through the flames of thought,\nl
To meet me in the abyss and on the heights,\nl
To feel me in the tempest and the calm,\nl
And love me in the noble and the vile,\nl
In beautiful things and terrible desire.\nl
The pains of hell shall be to thee my kiss,\nl
The flowers of heaven persuade thee with my touch.\nl
My fiercest masks shall my attractions bring.\nl
Music shall find thee in the voice of swords,\nl
Beauty pursue thee through the core of flame.\nl
Thou shalt know me in the rolling of the spheres\nl
And cross me in the atoms of the whirl.\nl
The wheeling forces of my universe\nl
Shall cry to thee the summons of my name.\nl
Delight shall drop down from my nectarous moon,\nl
My fragrance seize thee in the jasmine's snare,\nl
My eye shall look upon thee from the sun.\nl
Mirror of Nature's secret spirit made,\nl
Thou shalt reflect my hidden heart of joy,\nl
Thou shalt drink down my sweetness unalloyed\nl
In my pure lotus-cup of starry brim.\nl
My dreadful hands laid on thy bosom shall force\nl
Thy being bathed in fiercest longing's streams.\nl
Thou shalt discover the one and quivering note,\nl
And cry, the harp of all my melodies,\nl
And roll, my foaming wave in seas of love.\nl
Page 700

Even my disasters' clutch shall be to thee\nl
The ordeal of my rapture's contrary shape:\nl
In pain's self shall smile on thee my secret face:\nl
Thou shalt bear my ruthless beauty unabridged\nl
Amid the world's intolerable wrongs,\nl
Trampled by the violent misdeeds of Time\nl
Cry out to the ecstasy of my rapture's touch.\nl
All beings shall be to thy life my emissaries;\nl
Drawn to me on the bosom of thy friend,\nl
Compelled to meet me in thy enemy's eyes,\nl
My creatures shall demand me from thy heart.\nl
Thou shalt not shrink from any brother soul.\nl
Thou shalt be attracted helplessly to all.\nl
Men seeing thee shall feel my hands of joy,\nl
In sorrow's pangs feel steps of the world's delight,\nl
Their life experience its tumultuous shock\nl
In the mutual craving of two opposites.\nl
Hearts touched by thy love shall answer to my call,\nl
Discover the ancient music of the spheres\nl
In the revealing accents of thy voice\nl
And nearer draw to me because thou art:\nl
Enamoured of thy spirit's loveliness\nl
They shall embrace my body in thy soul,\nl
Hear in thy life the beauty of my laugh,\nl
Know the thrilled bliss with which I made the worlds.\nl
All that thou hast, shall be for others' bliss,\nl
All that thou art, shall to my hands belong.\nl
I will pour delight from thee as from a jar,\nl
I will whirl thee as my chariot through the ways,\nl
I will use thee as my sword and as my lyre,\nl
I will play on thee my minstrelsies of thought.\nl
And when thou art vibrant with all ecstasy,\nl
And when thou liv'st one spirit with all things,\nl
Then will I spare thee not my living fires,\nl
But make thee a channel for my timeless force.\nl
My hidden presence led thee unknowing on\nl
Page 701

From thy beginning in earth's voiceless bosom\nl
Through life and pain and time and will and death,\nl
Through outer shocks and inner silences\nl
Along the mystic roads of Space and Time\nl
To the experience which all Nature hides.\nl
Who hunts and seizes me, my captive grows:\nl
This shalt thou henceforth learn from thy heart-beats.\nl
For ever love, O beautiful slave of God!\nl
O lasso of my rapture's widening noose,\nl
Become my cord of universal love.\nl
The spirit ensnared by thee force to delight\nl
Of creation's oneness sweet and fathomless,\nl
Compelled to embrace my myriad unities\nl
And all my endless forms and divine souls.\nl
O Mind, grow full of the eternal peace;\nl
O Word, cry out the immortal litany:\nl
Built is the golden tower, the flame-child born.\nl
\sparn “Descend to life with him thy heart desires.\nl
O Satyavan, O luminous Savitri,\nl
I sent you forth of old beneath the stars,\nl
A dual power of God in an ignorant world,\nl
In a hedged creation shut from limitless self,\nl
Bringing down God to the insentient globe,\nl
Lifting earth-beings to immortality.\nl
In the world of my knowledge and my ignorance\nl
Where God is unseen and only is heard a Name\nl
And knowledge is trapped in the boundaries of mind\nl
And life is hauled in the drag-net of desire\nl
And Matter hides the soul from its own sight,\nl
You are my Force at work to uplift earth's fate,\nl
My self that moves up the immense incline\nl
Between the extremes of the spirit's night and day.\nl
He is my soul that climbs from nescient Night\nl
Through life and mind and supernature's Vast\nl
To the supernal light of Timelessness\nl
And my eternity hid in moving Time\nl
Page 702

And my boundlessness cut by the curve of Space.\nl
It climbs to the greatness it has left behind\nl
And to the beauty and joy from which it fell,\nl
To the closeness and sweetness of all things divine,\nl
To light without bounds and life illimitable,\nl
Taste of the depths of the Ineffable's bliss,\nl
Touch of the immortal and the infinite.\nl
He is my soul that gropes out of the beast\nl
To reach humanity's heights of lucent thought\nl
And the vicinity of Truth's sublime.\nl
He is the godhead growing in human lives\nl
And in the body of earth-being's forms:\nl
He is the soul of man climbing to God\nl
In Nature's surge out of earth's ignorance.\nl
O Savitri, thou art my spirit's Power,\nl
The revealing voice of my immortal Word,\nl
The face of Truth upon the roads of Time\nl
Pointing to the souls of men the routes to God.\nl
While the dim light from the veiled Spirit's peak\nl
Falls upon Matter's stark inconscient sleep\nl
As if a pale moonbeam on a dense glade,\nl
And Mind in a half-light moves amid half-truths\nl
And the human heart knows only human love\nl
And life is a stumbling and imperfect force\nl
And the body counts out its precarious days,\nl
You shall be born into man's dubious hours\nl
In forms that hide the soul's divinity\nl
And show through veils of the earth's doubting air\nl
My glory breaking as through clouds a sun,\nl
Or burning like a rare and inward fire,\nl
And with my nameless influence fill men's lives.\nl
Yet shall they look up as to peaks of God\nl
And feel God like a circumambient air\nl
And rest on God as on a motionless base.\nl
Yet shall there glow on mind like a horned moon\nl
The Spirit's crescent splendour in pale skies\nl
Page 703

And light man's life upon his Godward road.\nl
But more there is concealed in God's Beyond\nl
That shall one day reveal its hidden face.\nl
Now mind is all and its uncertain ray,\nl
Mind is the leader of the body and life,\nl
Mind the thought-driven chariot of the soul\nl
Carrying the luminous wanderer in the night\nl
To vistas of a far uncertain dawn,\nl
To the end of the Spirit's fathomless desire,\nl
To its dream of absolute truth and utter bliss.\nl
There are greater destinies mind cannot surmise\nl
Fixed on the summit of the evolving Path\nl
The Traveller now treads in the Ignorance,\nl
Unaware of his next step, not knowing his goal.\nl
Mind is not all his tireless climb can reach,\nl
There is a fire on the apex of the worlds,\nl
There is a house of the Eternal's light,\nl
There is an infinite truth, an absolute power.\nl
The Spirit's mightiness shall cast off its mask;\nl
Its greatness shall be felt shaping the world's course:\nl
It shall be seen in its own veilless beams,\nl
A star rising from the Inconscient's night,\nl
A sun climbing to Supernature's peak.\nl
Abandoning the dubious middle Way,\nl
A few shall glimpse the miraculous Origin\nl
And some shall feel in you the secret Force\nl
And they shall turn to meet a nameless tread,\nl
Adventurers into a mightier Day.\nl
Ascending out of the limiting breadths of mind,\nl
They shall discover the world's huge design\nl
And step into the Truth, the Right, the Vast.\nl
You shall reveal to them the hidden eternities,\nl
The breath of infinitudes not yet revealed,\nl
Some rapture of the bliss that made the world,\nl
Some rush of the force of God's omnipotence,\nl
Some beam of the omniscient Mystery.\nl
Page 704

But when the hour of the Divine draws near\nl
The Mighty Mother shall take birth in Time\nl
And God be born into the human clay\nl
In forms made ready by your human lives.\nl
Then shall the Truth supreme be given to men:\nl
There is a being beyond the being of mind,\nl
An Immeasurable cast into many forms,\nl
A miracle of the multitudinous One,\nl
There is a consciousness mind cannot touch,\nl
Its speech cannot utter nor its thought reveal.\nl
It has no home on earth, no centre in man,\nl
Yet is the source of all things thought and done,\nl
The fount of the creation and its works,\nl
It is the origin of all truth here,\nl
The sun-orb of mind's fragmentary rays,\nl
Infinity's heaven that spills the rain of God,\nl
The Immense that calls to man to expand the Spirit,\nl
The wide Aim that justifies his narrow attempts,\nl
A channel for the little he tastes of bliss.\nl
Some shall be made the glory's receptacles\nl
And vehicles of the Eternal's luminous power.\nl
These are the high forerunners, the heads of Time,\nl
The great deliverers of earth-bound mind,\nl
The high transfigurers of human clay,\nl
The first-born of a new supernal race.\nl
The incarnate dual Power shall open God's door,\nl
Eternal supermind touch earthly Time.\nl
The superman shall wake in mortal man\nl
And manifest the hidden demigod\nl
Or grow into the God-Light and God-Force\nl
Revealing the secret deity in the cave.\nl
Then shall the earth be touched by the Supreme,\nl
His bright unveiled Transcendence shall illumine\nl
The mind and heart and force the life and act\nl
To interpret his inexpressible mystery\nl
In a heavenly alphabet of Divinity's signs.\nl
Page 705

His living cosmic spirit shall enring,\nl
Annulling the decree of death and pain,\nl
Erasing the formulas of the Ignorance,\nl
With the deep meaning of beauty and life's hid sense,\nl
The being ready for immortality,\nl
His regard crossing infinity's mystic waves\nl
Bring back to Nature her early joy to live,\nl
The metred heart-beats of a lost delight,\nl
The cry of a forgotten ecstasy,\nl
The dance of the first world-creating Bliss.\nl
The Immanent shall be the witness God\nl
Watching on his many-petalled lotus-throne\nl
His actionless being and his silent might\nl
Ruling earth-nature by eternity's law,\nl
A thinker waking the Inconscient's world,\nl
An immobile centre of many infinitudes\nl
In his thousand-pillared temple by Time's sea.\nl
Then shall the embodied being live as one\nl
Who is a thought, a will of the Divine,\nl
A mask or robe of his divinity,\nl
An instrument and partner of his Force,\nl
A point or line drawn in the infinite,\nl
A manifest of the Imperishable.\nl
The supermind shall be his nature's fount,\nl
The Eternal's truth shall mould his thoughts and acts,\nl
The Eternal's truth shall be his light and guide.\nl
All then shall change, a magic order come\nl
Overtopping this mechanical universe.\nl
A mightier race shall inhabit the mortal's world.\nl
On Nature's luminous tops, on the Spirit's ground,\nl
The superman shall reign as king of life,\nl
Make earth almost the mate and peer of heaven,\nl
And lead towards God and truth man's ignorant heart\nl
And lift towards godhead his mortality.\nl
A power released from circumscribing bounds,\nl
Its height pushed up beyond death's hungry reach,\nl
Page 706

Life's tops shall flame with the Immortal's thoughts,\nl
Light shall invade the darkness of its base.\nl
Then in the process of evolving Time\nl
All shall be drawn into a single plan,\nl
A divine harmony shall be earth's law,\nl
Beauty and joy remould her way to live:\nl
Even the body shall remember God,\nl
Nature shall draw back from mortality\nl
And Spirit's fires shall guide the earth's blind force;\nl
Knowledge shall bring into the aspirant Thought\nl
A high proximity to Truth and God.\nl
The supermind shall claim the world for Light\nl
And thrill with love of God the enamoured heart\nl
And place Light's crown on Nature's lifted head\nl
And found Light's reign on her unshaking base.\nl
A greater truth than earth's shall roof-in earth\nl
And shed its sunlight on the roads of mind;\nl
A power infallible shall lead the thought,\nl
A seeing Puissance govern life and act,\nl
In earthly hearts kindle the Immortal's fire.\nl
A soul shall wake in the Inconscient's house;\nl
The mind shall be God-vision's tabernacle,\nl
The body intuition's instrument,\nl
And life a channel for God's visible power.\nl
All earth shall be the Spirit's manifest home,\nl
Hidden no more by the body and the life,\nl
Hidden no more by the mind's ignorance;\nl
An unerring Hand shall shape event and act.\nl
The Spirit's eyes shall look through Nature's eyes,\nl
The Spirit's force shall occupy Nature's force.\nl
This world shall be God's visible garden-house,\nl
The earth shall be a field and camp of God,\nl
Man shall forget consent to mortality\nl
And his embodied frail impermanence.\nl
This universe shall unseal its occult sense,\nl
Creation's process change its antique front,\nl
Page 707

An ignorant evolution's hierarchy\nl
Release the Wisdom chained below its base.\nl
The Spirit shall be the master of his world\nl
Lurking no more in form's obscurity\nl
And Nature shall reverse her action's rule,\nl
The outward world disclose the Truth it veils;\nl
All things shall manifest the covert God,\nl
All shall reveal the Spirit's light and might\nl
And move to its destiny of felicity.\nl
Even should a hostile force cling to its reign\nl
And claim its right's perpetual sovereignty\nl
And man refuse his high spiritual fate,\nl
Yet shall the secret Truth in things prevail.\nl
For in the march of all-fulfilling Time\nl
The hour must come of the Transcendent's will:\nl
All turns and winds towards his predestined ends\nl
In Nature's fixed inevitable course\nl
Decreed since the beginning of the worlds\nl
In the deep essence of created things:\nl
Even there shall come as a high crown of all\nl
The end of Death, the death of Ignorance.\nl
But first high Truth must set her feet on earth\nl
And man aspire to the Eternal's light\nl
And all his members feel the Spirit's touch\nl
And all his life obey an inner Force.\nl
This too shall be; for a new life shall come,\nl
A body of the Superconscient's truth,\nl
A native field of Supernature's mights:\nl
It shall make earth's nescient ground Truth's colony,\nl
Make even the Ignorance a transparent robe\nl
Through which shall shine the brilliant limbs of Truth\nl
And Truth shall be a sun on Nature's head\nl
And Truth shall be the guide of Nature's steps\nl
And Truth shall gaze out of her nether deeps.\nl
When superman is born as Nature's king\nl
His presence shall transfigure Matter's world:\nl
Page 708

He shall light up Truth's fire in Nature's night,\nl
He shall lay upon the earth Truth's greater law;\nl
Man too shall turn towards the Spirit's call.\nl
Awake to his hidden possibility,\nl
Awake to all that slept within his heart\nl
And all that Nature meant when earth was formed\nl
And the Spirit made this ignorant world his home,\nl
He shall aspire to Truth and God and Bliss.\nl
Interpreter of a diviner law\nl
And instrument of a supreme design,\nl
The higher kind shall lean to lift up man.\nl
Man shall desire to climb to his own heights.\nl
The truth above shall wake a nether truth,\nl
Even the dumb earth become a sentient force.\nl
The Spirit's tops and Nature's base shall draw\nl
Near to the secret of their separate truth\nl
And know each other as one deity.\nl
The Spirit shall look out through Matter's gaze\nl
And Matter shall reveal the Spirit's face.\nl
Then man and superman shall be at one\nl
And all the earth become a single life.\nl
Even the multitude shall hear the Voice\nl
And turn to commune with the Spirit within\nl
And strive to obey the high spiritual law:\nl
This earth shall stir with impulses sublime,\nl
Humanity awake to deepest self,\nl
Nature the hidden godhead recognise.\nl
Even the many shall some answer make\nl
And bear the splendour of the Divine's rush\nl
And his impetuous knock at unseen doors.\nl
A heavenlier passion shall upheave men's lives,\nl
Their mind shall share in the ineffable gleam,\nl
Their heart shall feel the ecstasy and the fire.\nl
Earth's bodies shall be conscious of a soul;\nl
Mortality's bondslaves shall unloose their bonds,\nl
Mere men into spiritual beings grow\nl
Page 709

And see awake the dumb divinity.\nl
Intuitive beams shall touch the nature's peaks,\nl
A revelation stir the nature's depths;\nl
The Truth shall be the leader of their lives,\nl
Truth shall dictate their thought and speech and act,\nl
They shall feel themselves lifted nearer to the sky,\nl
As if a little lower than the gods.\nl
For knowledge shall pour down in radiant streams\nl
And even darkened mind quiver with new life\nl
And kindle and burn with the Ideal's fire\nl
And turn to escape from mortal ignorance.\nl
The frontiers of the Ignorance shall recede,\nl
More and more souls shall enter into light,\nl
Minds lit, inspired, the occult summoner hear\nl
And lives blaze with a sudden inner flame\nl
And hearts grow enamoured of divine delight\nl
And human wills tune to the divine will,\nl
These separate selves the Spirit's oneness feel,\nl
These senses of heavenly sense grow capable,\nl
The flesh and nerves of a strange ethereal joy\nl
And mortal bodies of immortality.\nl
A divine force shall flow through tissue and cell\nl
And take the charge of breath and speech and act\nl
And all the thoughts shall be a glow of suns\nl
And every feeling a celestial thrill.\nl
Often a lustrous inner dawn shall come\nl
Lighting the chambers of the slumbering mind;\nl
A sudden bliss shall run through every limb\nl
And Nature with a mightier Presence fill.\nl
Thus shall the earth open to divinity\nl
And common natures feel the wide uplift,\nl
Illumine common acts with the Spirit's ray\nl
And meet the deity in common things.\nl
Nature shall live to manifest secret God,\nl
The Spirit shall take up the human play,\nl
This earthly life become the life divine.”\nl
Page 710

\spar The measure of that subtle music ceased.\nl
Down with a hurried swimming floating lapse\nl
Through unseen worlds and bottomless spaces forced\nl
Sank like a star the soul of Savitri.\nl
Amidst a laughter of unearthly lyres\nl
She heard around her nameless voices cry\nl
Triumphing, an innumerable sound.\nl
A choir of rushing winds to meet her came.\nl
She bore the burden of infinity\nl
And felt the stir of all ethereal space.\nl
Pursuing her in her fall, implacably sweet,\nl
A face was over her which seemed a youth's,\nl
Symbol of all the beauty eyes see not,\nl
Crowned as with peacock plumes of gorgeous hue\nl
Framing a sapphire, whose heart-disturbing smile\nl
Insatiably attracted to delight,\nl
Voluptuous to the embraces of her soul.\nl
Changed in its shape, yet rapturously the same,\nl
It grew a woman's dark and beautiful\nl
Like a mooned night with drifting star-gemmed clouds,\nl
A shadowy glory and a stormy depth,\nl
Turbulent in will and terrible in love.\nl
Eyes in which Nature's blind ecstatic life\nl
Sprang from some spirit's passionate content,\nl
Missioned her to the whirling dance of earth.\nl
Amidst the headlong rapture of her fall\nl
Held like a bird in a child's satisfied hands,\nl
In an enamoured grasp her spirit strove\nl
Admitting no release till Time should end,\nl
And, as the fruit of the mysterious joy,\nl
She kept within her strong embosoming soul\nl
Like a flower hidden in the heart of spring\nl
The soul of Satyavan drawn down by her\nl
Inextricably in that mighty lapse.\nl
Invisible heavens in a thronging flight\nl
Soared past her as she fell. Then all the blind\nl
Page 711

And near attraction of the earth compelled\nl
Fearful rapidities of downward bliss.\nl
Lost in the giddy proneness of that speed,\nl
Whirled, sinking, overcome she disappeared,\nl
Like a leaf spinning from the tree of heaven,\nl
In broad unconsciousness as in a pool;\nl
A hospitable softness drew her in\nl
Into a wonder of miraculous depths,\nl
Above her closed a darkness of great wings\nl
And she was buried in a mother's breast.\nl
\sparn Then from a timeless plane that watches Time,\nl
A Spirit gazed out upon destiny,\nl
In its endless moment saw the ages pass.\nl
All still was in a silence of the gods.\nl
The prophet moment covered limitless Space\nl
And cast into the heart of hurrying Time\nl
A diamond light of the Eternal's peace,\nl
A crimson seed of God's felicity;\nl
A glance from the gaze fell of undying Love.\nl
A wonderful face looked out with deathless eyes;\nl
A hand was seen drawing the golden bars\nl
That guard the imperishable secrecies.\nl
A key turned in a mystic lock of Time.\nl
But where the silence of the gods had passed,\nl
A greater harmony from the stillness born\nl
Surprised with joy and sweetness yearning hearts,\nl
An ecstasy and a laughter and a cry.\nl
A power leaned down, a happiness found its home.\nl
Over wide earth brooded the infinite bliss.\nl

\sbigcap Out of abysmal trance her spirit woke.\nl
Lain on the earth-mother's calm inconscient breast\nl
She saw the green-clad branches lean above\nl
Guarding her sleep with their enchanted life,\nl
And overhead a blue-winged ecstasy\nl
Fluttered from bough to bough with high-pitched call.\nl
Into the magic secrecy of the woods\nl
Peering through an emerald lattice-window of leaves,\nl
In indolent skies reclined, the thinning day\nl
Turned to its slow fall into evening's peace.\nl
She pressed the living body of Satyavan:\nl
On her body's wordless joy to be and breathe\nl
She bore the blissful burden of his head\nl
Between her breasts' warm labour of delight,\nl
The waking gladness of her members felt\nl
The weight of heaven in his limbs, a touch\nl
Summing the whole felicity of things,\nl
And all her life was conscious of his life\nl
And all her being rejoiced enfolding his.\nl
The immense remoteness of her trance had passed;\nl
Human she was once more, earth's Savitri,\nl
Yet felt in her illimitable change.\nl
A power dwelt in her soul too great for earth,\nl
A bliss lived in her heart too large for heaven;\nl
Light too intense for thought and love too boundless\nl
For earth's emotions lit her skies of mind\nl
And spread through her deep and happy seas of soul.\nl
All that is sacred in the world drew near\nl
To her divine passivity of mood.\nl
A marvellous voice of silence breathed its thoughts.\nl
All things in Time and Space she had taken for hers;\nl
Page 715

In her they moved, by her they lived and were,\nl
The whole wide world clung to her for delight,\nl
Created for her rapt embrace of love.\nl
Now in her spaceless self released from bounds\nl
Unnumbered years seemed moments long drawn out,\nl
The brilliant time-flakes of eternity.\nl
Outwingings of a bird from its bright home,\nl
Her earthly morns were radiant flights of joy.\nl
Boundless she was, a form of infinity.\nl
Absorbed no longer by the moment's beat\nl
Her spirit the unending future felt\nl
And lived with all the unbeginning past.\nl
Her life was a dawn's victorious opening,\nl
The past and unborn days had joined their dreams,\nl
Old vanished eves and far arriving noons\nl
Hinted to her a vision of prescient hours.\nl
Supine in musing bliss she lay awhile\nl
Given to the wonder of a waking trance;\nl
Half-risen then she sent her gaze around,\nl
As if to recover old sweet trivial threads,\nl
Old happy thoughts, small treasured memories,\nl
And weave them into one immortal day.\nl
Ever she held on the paradise of her breast\nl
Her lover charmed into a fathomless sleep,\nl
Lain like an infant spirit unaware\nl
Lulled on the verge of two consenting worlds.\nl
But soon she leaned down over her loved to call\nl
His mind back to her with her travelling touch\nl
On his closed eyelids; settled was her still look\nl
Of strong delight, not yearning now, but large\nl
With limitless joy or sovereign last content,\nl
Pure, passionate with the passion of the gods.\nl
Desire stirred not its wings; for all was made\nl
An overarching of celestial rays\nl
Like the absorbed control of sky on plain,\nl
Heaven's leaning down to embrace from all sides earth,\nl
Page 716

A quiet rapture, a vast security.\nl
Then sighing to her touch the soft-winged sleep\nl
Rose hovering from his flowerlike lids and flew\nl
Murmurous away. Awake, he found her eyes\nl
Waiting for his, and felt her hands, and saw\nl
The earth his home given back to him once more\nl
And her made his again, his passion's all.\nl
With his arms' encircling hold around her locked,\nl
A living knot to make possession close,\nl
He murmured with hesitating lips her name,\nl
And vaguely recollecting wonder cried,\nl
“Whence hast thou brought me captive back, love-chained,\nl
To thee and sunlight's walls, O golden beam\nl
And casket of all sweetness, Savitri,\nl
Godhead and woman, moonlight of my soul?\nl
For surely I have travelled in strange worlds\nl
By thee companioned, a pursuing spirit,\nl
Together we have disdained the gates of night.\nl
I have turned away from the celestials' joy\nl
And heaven's insufficient without thee.\nl
Where now has passed that formidable Shape\nl
Which rose against us, the Spirit of the Void,\nl
Claiming the world for Death and Nothingness,\nl
Denying God and soul? Or was all a dream\nl
Or a vision seen in a spiritual sleep,\nl
A symbol of the oppositions of Time\nl
Or a mind-lit beacon of significance\nl
In some stress of darkness lighting on the Way\nl
Or guiding a swimmer through the straits of Death,\nl
Or finding with the succour of its ray\nl
In a gully mid the crowded streets of Chance\nl
The soul that into the world-adventure came,\nl
A scout and voyager from Eternity?”\nl
But she replied, “Our parting was the dream;\nl
We are together, we live, O Satyavan.\nl
Look round thee and behold, glad and unchanged\nl
Page 717

Our home, this forest with its thousand cries\nl
And the whisper of the wind among the leaves\nl
And, through rifts in emerald scene, the evening sky,\nl
God's canopy of blue sheltering our lives,\nl
And the birds crying for heart's happiness,\nl
Winged poets of our solitary reign,\nl
Our friends on earth where we are king and queen.\nl
Only our souls have left Death's night behind,\nl
Changed by a mighty dream's reality,\nl
Illumined by the light of symbol worlds\nl
And the stupendous summit self of things,\nl
And stood at Godhead's gates limitless, free.”\nl
\sparn Then filled with the glory of their happiness\nl
They rose and with safe clinging fingers locked\nl
Hung on each other in a silent look.\nl
But he with a new wonder in his heart\nl
And a new flame of worship in his eyes:\nl
“What high change is in thee, O Savitri? Bright\nl
Ever thou wast, a goddess still and pure,\nl
Yet dearer to me by thy sweet human parts\nl
Earth gave thee making thee yet more divine.\nl
My adoration mastered, my desire\nl
Bent down to make its subject, my daring clasped,\nl
Claiming by body and soul my life's estate,\nl
Rapture's possession, love's sweet property,\nl
A statue of silence in my templed spirit,\nl
A yearning godhead and a golden bride.\nl
But now thou seemst almost too high and great\nl
For mortal worship; Time lies below thy feet\nl
And the whole world seems only a part of thee,\nl
Thy presence the hushed heaven I inhabit,\nl
And thou lookst on me in the gaze of the stars,\nl
Yet art the earthly keeper of my soul,\nl
My life a whisper of thy dreaming thoughts,\nl
My morns a gleaming of thy spirit's wings,\nl
And day and night are of thy beauty part.\nl
Page 718

Hast thou not taken my heart to treasure it\nl
In the secure environment of thy breast?\nl
Awakened from the silence and the sleep,\nl
I have consented for thy sake to be.\nl
By thee I have greatened my mortal arc of life,\nl
But now far heavens, unmapped infinitudes\nl
Thou hast brought me, thy illimitable gift!\nl
If to fill these thou lift thy sacred flight,\nl
My human earth will still demand thy bliss.\nl
Make still my life through thee a song of joy\nl
And all my silence wide and deep with thee.”\nl
A heavenly queen consenting to his will,\nl
She clasped his feet, by her enshrining hair\nl
Enveloped in a velvet cloak of love,\nl
And answered softly like a murmuring lute:\nl
“All now is changed, yet all is still the same.\nl
Lo, we have looked upon the face of God,\nl
Our life has opened with divinity.\nl
We have borne identity with the Supreme\nl
And known his meaning in our mortal lives.\nl
Our love has grown greater by that mighty touch\nl
And learned its heavenly significance,\nl
Yet nothing is lost of mortal love's delight.\nl
Heaven's touch fulfils but cancels not our earth:\nl
Our bodies need each other in the same last;\nl
Still in our breasts repeat heavenly secret rhythm\nl
Our human heart-beats passionately close.\nl
Still am I she who came to thee mid the murmur\nl
Of sunlit leaves upon this forest verge;\nl
I am the Madran, I am Savitri.\nl
All that I was before, I am to thee still,\nl
Close comrade of thy thoughts and hopes and toils,\nl
All happy contraries I would join for thee.\nl
All sweet relations marry in our life;\nl
I am thy kingdom even as thou art mine,\nl
The sovereign and the slave of thy desire,\nl
Page 719

Thy prone possessor, sister of thy soul\nl
And mother of thy wants; thou art my world,\nl
The earth I need, the heaven my thoughts desire,\nl
The world I inhabit and the god I adore.\nl
Thy body is my body's counterpart\nl
Whose every limb my answering limb desires,\nl
Whose heart is key to all my heart-beats,—this\nl
I am and thou to me, O Satyavan.\nl
Our wedded walk through life begins anew,\nl
No gladness lost, no depth of mortal joy.\nl
Let us go through this new world that is the same,\nl
For it is given back, but it is known,\nl
A playing-ground and dwelling-house of God\nl
Who hides himself in bird and beast and man\nl
Sweetly to find himself again by love,\nl
By oneness. His presence leads the rhythms of life\nl
That seek for mutual joy in spite of pain.\nl
We have each other found, O Satyavan,\nl
In the great light of the discovered soul.\nl
Let us go back, for eve is in the skies.\nl
Now grief is dead and serene bliss remains\nl
The heart of all our days for evermore.\nl
Lo, all these beings in this wonderful world!\nl
Let us give joy to all, for joy is ours.\nl
For not for ourselves alone our spirits came\nl
Out of the veil of the Unmanifest,\nl
Out of the deep immense Unknowable\nl
Upon the ignorant breast of dubious earth,\nl
Into the ways of labouring, seeking men,\nl
Two fires that burn towards that parent Sun,\nl
Two rays that travel to the original Light.\nl
To lead man's soul towards truth and God we are born,\nl
To draw the chequered scheme of mortal life\nl
Into some semblance of the Immortal's plan,\nl
To shape it closer to an image of God,\nl
A little nearer to the Idea divine.”\nl
Page 720

She closed her arms about his breast and head\nl
As if to keep him on her bosom worn\nl
For ever through the journeying of the years.\nl
So for a while they stood entwined, their kiss\nl
And passion-tranced embrace a meeting-point\nl
In their commingling spirits one for ever,\nl
Two-souled, two-bodied for the joys of Time.\nl
Then hand in hand they left that solemn place\nl
Full now of mute unusual memories,\nl
To the green distance of their sylvan home\nl
Returning slowly through the forest's heart.\nl
Round them the afternoon to evening changed;\nl
Light slipped down to the brightly sleeping verge,\nl
And the birds came back winging to their nests,\nl
And day and night leaned to each other's arms.\nl

\spar Now the dusk shadowy trees stood close around\nl
Like dreaming spirits and, delaying night,\nl
The grey-eyed pensive evening heard their steps,\nl
And from all points the cries and movements came\nl
Of the four-footed wanderers of the night\nl
Approaching. Then a human rumour rose\nl
Long alien to their solitary days,\nl
Invading the charmed wilderness of leaves\nl
Once sacred to secluded loneliness\nl
With violent breaking of its virgin sleep.\nl
Through the screened dusk it deepened still and there neared\nl
Floating of many voices and the sound\nl
Of many feet, till on their sight broke in\nl
As if a coloured wave upon the eye\nl
The brilliant strenuous crowded days of man.\nl
Topped by a flaring multitude of lights\nl
A great resplendent company arrived.\nl
Life in its ordered tumult wavering came\nl
Bringing its stream of unknown faces, thronged\nl
With gold-fringed headdresses, gold-broidered robes,\nl
Page 721

Glittering of ornaments, fluttering of hems,\nl
Hundreds of hands parted the forest-boughs,\nl
Hundreds of eyes searched the entangled glades.\nl
Calm white-clad priests their grave-eyed sweetness brought,\nl
Strong warriors in their glorious armour shone,\nl
The proud-hooved steeds came trampling through the wood.\nl
In front King Dyumatsena walked, no more\nl
Blind, faltering-limbed, but his far-questing eyes\nl
Restored to all their confidence in light\nl
Took seeingly this imaged outer world;\nl
Firmly he trod with monarch step the soil.\nl
By him that queen and mother's anxious face\nl
Came changed from its habitual burdened look\nl
Which in its drooping strength of tired toil\nl
Had borne the fallen life of those she loved.\nl
Her patient paleness wore a pensive glow\nl
Like evening's subdued gaze of gathered light\nl
Departing, which foresees sunrise her child.\nl
Sinking in quiet splendours of her sky,\nl
She lives awhile to muse upon that hope,\nl
The brilliance of her rich receding gleam\nl
A thoughtful prophecy of lyric dawn.\nl
Her eyes were first to find her children's forms.\nl
But at the vision of the beautiful twain\nl
The air awoke perturbed with scaling cries,\nl
And the swift parents hurrying to their child,—\nl
Their cause of life now who had given him breath,—\nl
Possessed him with their arms. Then tenderly\nl
Cried Dyumatsena chiding Satyavan:\nl
“The fortunate gods have looked on me today,\nl
A kingdom seeking came and heaven's rays.\nl
But where wast thou? Thou hast tormented gladness\nl
With fear's dull shadow, O my child, my life.\nl
What danger kept thee for the darkening woods?\nl
Or how could pleasure in her ways forget\nl
That useless orbs without thee are my eyes\nl
Page 722

Which only for thy sake rejoice at light?\nl
Not like thyself was this done, Savitri,\nl
Who ledst not back thy husband to our arms,\nl
Knowing with him beside me only is taste\nl
In food and for his touch evening and morn\nl
I live content with my remaining days.”\nl
But Satyavan replied with smiling lips,\nl
“Lay all on her; she is the cause of all.\nl
With her enchantments she has twined me round.\nl
Behold, at noon leaving this house of clay\nl
I wandered in far-off eternities,\nl
Yet still, a captive in her golden hands,\nl
I tread your little hillock called green earth\nl
And in the moments of your transient sun\nl
Live glad among the busy works of men.”\nl
Then all eyes turned their wondering looks where stood,\nl
A deepening redder gold upon her cheeks,\nl
With lowered lids the noble lovely child,\nl
And one consenting thought moved every breast.\nl
“What gleaming marvel of the earth or skies\nl
Stands silently by human Satyavan\nl
To mark a brilliance in the dusk of eve?\nl
If this is she of whom the world has heard,\nl
Wonder no more at any happy change.\nl
Each easy miracle of felicity\nl
Of her transmuting heart the alchemy is.”\nl
Then one spoke there who seemed a priest and sage:\nl
“O woman soul, what light, what power revealed,\nl
Working the rapid marvels of this day,\nl
Opens for us by thee a happier age?”\nl
Her lashes fluttering upwards gathered in\nl
To a vision which had scanned immortal things,\nl
Rejoicing, human forms for their delight.\nl
They claimed for their deep childlike motherhood\nl
The life of all these souls to be her life,\nl
Then falling veiled the light. Low she replied,\nl
Page 723

“Awakened to the meaning of my heart\nl
That to feel love and oneness is to live\nl
And this the magic of our golden change,\nl
Is all the truth I know or seek, O sage.”\nl
Wondering at her and her too luminous words\nl
Westward they turned in the fast-gathering night.\nl

\spar From the entangling verges freed they came\nl
Into a dimness of the sleeping earth\nl
And travelled through her faint and slumbering plains.\nl
Murmur and movement and the tread of men\nl
Broke the night's solitude; the neigh of steeds\nl
Rose from that indistinct and voiceful sea\nl
Of life and all along its marchings swelled\nl
The rhyme of hooves, the chariot's homeward voice.\nl
Drawn by white manes upon a high-roofed car\nl
In flare of the unsteady torches went\nl
With linked hands Satyavan and Savitri,\nl
Hearing a marriage march and nuptial hymn,\nl
Where waited them the many-voiced human world.\nl
Numberless the stars swam on their shadowy field\nl
Describing in the gloom the ways of light.\nl
Then while they skirted yet the southward verge,\nl
Lost in the halo of her musing brows\nl
Night, splendid with the moon dreaming in heaven\nl
In silver peace, possessed her luminous reign.\nl
She brooded through her stillness on a thought\nl
Deep-guarded by her mystic folds of light,\nl
And in her bosom nursed a greater dawn.\nl

\ht Note on the Text
\par\nodrop SAVITRI began as a narrative poem of moderate length based
on a legend told in the Mahabharata. Sri Aurobindo considered the story to be
originally “one of the many symbolic myths of the Vedic cycle”. Bringing out
its symbolism and charging it progressively with his own spiritual vision, he
turned {\it Savitri} into the epic it is today.
\par By the time it was published, some passages had gone through dozens of
drafts. Sri Aurobindo explained how he wrote the poem: “I used {\it Savitri}
as a means of ascension. I began with it on a certain mental level, each time
I could reach a higher level I rewrote from that level.\sdots In fact {\it
Savitri} has not been regarded by me as a poem to be written and finished,
but as a field of experimentation to see how far poetry could be written from
one's own yogic consciousness and how that could be made creative.”
\par The following outline of the composition and publication of {\it Savitri}
draws upon all existing manuscripts and other textual materials, supplemented
by the author's letters on the poem. In brief, {\it Savitri} took shape through
three major phases.
\par (1) Before 1920, Sri Aurobindo made a number of drafts of a narrative
poem retelling in an original way the tale of Savitri and Satyavan. Its last
version had a plan of eight books in two parts; the books were not divided
into cantos. (2) In the 1930s, he set about converting this narrative poem into
an epic. For a long time he concentrated on the description of Aswapati's
Yoga prior to the birth of Savitri, creating by 1945 a new Part One with three
books and many cantos. (3) In the last phase, besides revising Part One for
publication, he reworked and enlarged most of the books written in the first
period. He added a book on the Yoga of Savitri, making twelve books and
forty-nine cantos in all and completing Parts Two and Three.
\par
\ht The Composition of {\it Savitri}
\par Sri Aurobindo read the Savitri-episode of the Mahabharata in Sanskrit
while he was in Baroda. He expressed appreciation of its style in his “Notes
on the Mahabharata”, written around 1901. But a report that he worked on
an English poem on the subject at this time is not supported by his own
statements or any documents that survive. If there was a Baroda {\it Savitri},
which is doubtful, it was among the writings of which Sri Aurobindo wrote in
1933, “Most of all that has disappeared into the unknown in the whirlpools
and turmoil of my political career.” Even assuming that such a poem was
written in Baroda, for all practical purposes {\it Savitri} as we know it was
commenced in Pondicherry.
\par The opening of the first known version is dated “August 8th 9th / 1916”.
Further dates occur later on in the draft. From the death of Satyavan to the
end of Savitri's debate with Death, the manuscript is marked every few
pages with dates from a three-day period, 17-19 October. After this, the
consecutive narration breaks off and the notebook contains only disconnected
passages. Some of these are sketches for the conclusion of the poem. Most
of them go back over what was already written. They represent the
beginning of the long process of rewriting which was to continue until 1950.
\par This earliest surviving manuscript of {\it Savitri} shows every sign of
being the first draft. It is one of the few versions that Sri Aurobindo dated.
But even if precise dates cannot be assigned to them, the manuscripts of the
poem can almost always be placed in a definite order after a careful
comparison. This is because changes made when one draft was revised were
usually incorporated in the next draft, which would then be further altered
and most often expanded.
\par Initially the poem was short enough not to require division into books or
cantos. Its sections were separated only by blank lines. But soon Sri
Aurobindo was dividing it into “Book I”, ending with the death of Satyavan,
and “Book II”, recounting Savitri's debate with and victory over Death. Next
he adopted a scheme of six cantos and an epilogue. The canto titles were:
Love, Fate, Death, Night, Twilight and Day.
\par After making a few drafts in cantos, he started substituting the word
“book” for “canto”. There were now six books with the same names as the
former cantos. Meanwhile the larger division had reappeared as two parts,
“Earth” and “Beyond”. At first each part comprised three books, not
counting the epilogue. But before long, the rapidly growing first book was
broken up into two. The second book kept the name “Love”; the first was
renamed “Quest”.
\par A manuscript beginning with “Book I / Quest” has the title “S\^avithr\^i: A
Tale and a Vision”. (In early versions, “S\^avithr\^i” was the usual spelling of the
heroine's name.) Sri Aurobindo referred to this stage in the poem's history in
a letter of 1936: “{\it Savitri} was originally written many years ago before
the Mother came [{\it i.e., before the Mother's final arrival in 1920}], as a
narrative poem in two parts, Part I Earth and Part II Beyond\sdots each
of four books—or rather Part II consisted of three books and an epilogue.”
\par This was the plan of {\it Savitri} at the end of the first phase of its
composition. But the last manuscript actually completed was in six cantos and
an epilogue. After “books” replaced the “cantos” and the number of books
increased, some books were worked over several times. Others were hardly
touched. There is a partial draft of “Book III / Death”, for example; there is
none from the stage when “Death” would have been the fourth book. After
1945 when Sri Aurobindo incorporated material from the early poem into
what was by then a full-fledged epic, he sometimes went back to a
manuscript of the six “cantos” as his starting-point.
\par{\it Savitri} was apparently put aside during most of the 1920s, a period
when Sri Aurobindo did little writing. The first evidence of its resumption is
found in a letter of 1931. Here he speaks of a radical change in the
conception and scope of the poem. Already the subtitle, “A Legend and a
Symbol”, is present in his mind: “There is a previous draft, the result of the
many retouchings of which somebody told you; but in that form it would not
have been a `{\it magnum opus}' at all. Besides, it would have been a legend
and not a symbol. I therefore started recasting the whole thing; only the best
passages and lines of the old draft will remain, altered so as to fit into the
new frame.”
\par Throughout the thirties and early forties, it was primarily Book One that
was affected by this recasting. At first this book was still called “Quest”. It
extended as far as Savitri's arrival at “The Destined Meeting-Place” (the
eventual title of Book Five, Canto One). But in the early thirties, the brief
description of the Yoga of King Aswapati near the beginning swelled to
hundreds of lines. What was to become the second and longest book of the
epic, “The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds”, began to take shape.
\par In a letter of 1936, Sri Aurobindo mentioned a new first book, the “Book
of Birth”, carved out of the overgrown “Quest”. Another letter of the same
year reveals the internal structure of this book. It was “divided into sections
and the larger sections into subsections”. Up to this point, the books had been
divided only into passages separated by spaces, as many cantos are now. As
these sections increased in length, they were recognised as formal units and
began to be named and numbered. Section marks () were usually put before
and after the numbers.
\par The Book of Birth, whose last section related the birth and childhood of
Savitri, was still disproportionately long and was constantly growing. Early in
1937, Sri Aurobindo expressed his intention of rearranging the opening books
into a Book of Beginnings and a Book of Birth and Quest.
\par Progress on the poem was intermittent in the thirties due to Sri
Aurobindo's heavy load of correspondence. From the end of 1938 to
mid-1940, work on {\it Savitri} was suspended. But on 6 September 1942, a
110-page draft of the Book of Beginnings was completed. The fourth of its
eight sections, “The Ascent through the Worlds”, accounted for more than
half the total length and had twelve subsections. In the next version, this
section became Book Two with the title it now has. The last four sections
were grouped into Book Three, “The Book of the Divine Mother”.
\par The second phase in the composition of {\it Savitri} reached its
culmination when the first three books were written out in two columns on
large sheets. Many passages, including the whole of the first and third books
and much of the second, went through two or more drafts in this form. The
last complete manuscript is dated “May 7. 1944” at the end.
\par It was while revising this manuscript that Sri Aurobindo reintroduced the
word “canto” which he had not used since an early stage, applying it to the
former “sections” of the books. At this point the third section of Book One,
“The Yoga of the King”, was turned into Cantos 3-5 with their present titles.
The three opening books were for the first time identified as “Part One”.
\par The two-column manuscript is the last continuous version of Part One in
Sri Aurobindo's hand. But he went on reworking Book One and passages
throughout Book Two. For this purpose he began using small note-pads
whose sheets, containing new or rewritten matter, could be torn out and
pinned to the principal manuscript at the appropriate places.
\par By the mid-1940s, Sri Aurobindo's eyesight was failing and his
handwriting was becoming less and less legible. He needed the help of a
scribe in order to put Books 1-3 into a finished form, take up the
long-neglected later books, and prepare {\it Savitri} for publication. This third
phase of its composition saw periods of rapid and decisive progress. But it
was to be interrupted the month before Sri Aurobindo's passing, a little short
of definitive completion.
\par Much had still to be done with the first part. Sri Aurobindo asked the
scribe to read the last version to him. After dictating changes, insertions and
transpositions, he had his assistant copy it into a large ledger. This copy was
meticulously revised before being given to another disciple for typing. The
typescript in its turn was read out to Sri Aurobindo and similarly revised.
Heavily revised pages were often retyped. The same process was sometimes
repeated, especially in the later cantos of Book Two, where three typed
copies exist.
\par{\it Savitri} now began to appear in print, though not yet in its final form.
The first and third books were brought out canto by canto from August 1946
to February 1948 in journals connected with the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. They
were also published in fascicles identical to the journal instalments. The
second book was issued in 1947 and 1948 in two large fascicles.
\par Differences between the typescripts and the printed texts show that
proofs of the latter must have been revised in detail by Sri Aurobindo.
Afterwards a copy of each fascicle was read to him. Even at this advanced
stage, he made extensive alterations and added new lines and passages.
\par Meanwhile he had turned his attention to the later books. The plan of
Parts Two and Three resembled that of the pre-1920 poem, whose books had
been divided into “Earth” (Quest, Love, Fate, Death) and “Beyond” (Night,
Twilight, Day, Epilogue). By 1945, however, most of these books had
remained untouched for twenty-five years. Everything written under what Sri
Aurobindo termed in 1934 “the old insufficient inspiration” would have to be
thoroughly recast. Moreover, a new book had been conceived: The Book of
Yoga. Destined to become one of the longest in the epic, six of its seven
cantos were still to be drafted.
\par The material in the Book of Birth and Quest had for a long time been
included in Book One. As a result it had gone through several drafts in the
1930s, while other books lay dormant. The last book to be set aside, it was
also the first to be taken up again. One manuscript of it precedes the 1942
draft of the Book of Beginnings. The final version was evidently written
within a year or so of this. Since much work had already been done on it, this
book needed less modification than others. Yet especially in the first two
cantos, Sri Aurobindo dictated substantial changes and additions when he
revised the manuscript and typescript.
\par The Book of Love shared to some extent in the good fortune of the
previous book during the thirties and early forties. But the last version in Sri
Aurobindo's hand, in the notebook which starts with his final manuscript of
Book Four, breaks off in the middle of the second canto. The continuation is
in the scribe's hand. It was copied there probably two or three years later
when the systematic revision of the later books had been undertaken.
\par The remainder of this notebook contains the scribe's copy of Books Six,
Nine and Ten, reworked from the corresponding books in the old poem,
expanded, divided into cantos and renamed “The Book of Fate”, “The Book
of Eternal Night” and “The Book of the Double Twilight”. Once Sri
Aurobindo had done enough with Books Four and Five for the time being, it
appears that he took up these three books one after the other. After Book
Six, he skipped to Book Nine, postponing extensive work on Books Seven
and Eight. However, he may have revised slightly the versions of the original
third book or canto, “Death”, on which Book Seven, Canto One and the
present Book of Death are based.
\par Drafts of “Fate”, “Night” and “Twilight” had been written on one side of
loose sheets of paper, like other cantos or books in several early versions of
{\it Savitri}. This facilitated the complex process of revision which was now
set in motion. When the space between lines and in the margins was filled up,
the backs of the pages were available. In extreme cases, whole cantos were
written on the reverse sides of the pages with little relation to what was on
the front.
\par Sri Aurobindo drafted many passages in small note-pads of the type used
for Part One. Lines for Books Five and Nine and large portions of Books Six
and Ten were written in this way. Canto Two of Book Six was almost
entirely new. The passages drafted for it were transferred by the scribe to
another note-pad, with changes dictated by Sri Aurobindo at the time.
\par The metamorphosis which the Book of Fate underwent included the
introduction of the Queen: some of Aswapati's later speeches in the old
version were now given to her, and her long speech at the beginning of Canto
Two was composed. Sri Aurobindo worked on this book in 1946 and brought
it close to its final form. But he was to return to it at the end and add
significantly to the second canto.
\par An early manuscript of “Night” was substantially revised and turned into
the two cantos of Book Nine. But in this instance Sri Aurobindo seems to
have found the pre-1920 version more adequate than usual. He left it intact to
a greater extent than in the case of other books on which he bestowed his full
attention in the 1940s. Only the Book of Death and the Epilogue stayed
closer to their original shape, but he always intended to come back to these.
\par On the other hand, old drafts of “Twilight” formed merely a
starting-point for the four cantos of Book Ten. The speeches of Savitri and
Death were refashioned, rearranged in their order, and new ones inserted.
As he proceeded from one canto to the next, Sri Aurobindo added longer and
longer passages that were quite new. The first section of Canto One, the long
speech of Death which ends Canto Two, all but the last few pages of Canto
Three, and most of Canto Four—especially its second half, where Savitri
finally triumphs over Death—owe little or nothing to any early version.
\par In a letter of 22 April 1947, Sri Aurobindo summarised the status of the
various books of the second and third parts. Books Four, Five, Six, Nine and
Ten had by then “been completed, in a general way, with a sufficient finality
of the whole form but subject to final changes in detail”. The other four
books were far from even a provisional completion.
\par A “drastic recasting of the last two books” was felt to be needed and
“only a part of the eleventh” had been subjected to that process. But a yet
larger task lay ahead, the splitting up of the original Book of Death and the
writing of the new cantos that would go into the Book of Yoga. In his letter
of April 1947 Sri Aurobindo did not say what he planned to do next. But there
are reasons to believe that, rather than going on directly from Book Ten to
Book Eleven, he now retraced his steps to Book Seven.
\par The description of Savitri's Yoga, complementing that of Aswapati's
Yoga in Part One, was drafted in a thick notebook whose first hundred pages
are filled with drafts for Book Ten, Canto Four. By March 1947, even before
finishing the tenth book, Sri Aurobindo had begun to use this notebook for
preliminary work on Book Seven. The scribe was not asked to copy the
semi-legible handwriting of the draft. Instead, Sri Aurobindo dictated to him
the lines he had jotted down, often in a somewhat different form. The
dictated version was extensively revised before a typed copy was made.
\par The Book of Yoga had four cantos at first. But the second, “The
Parable of the Finding of the Soul”, grew to an inordinate length. When the
typescript was revised, it was broken up into Cantos 2-5, from “The Parable
of the Search for the Soul” to “The Finding of the Soul”. Revision of the
typed copy was so elaborate in places (as elsewhere, especially in Book Six,
Canto Two and in Book Eleven) that sometimes there was not enough room
on the page. The scribe would then write on separate slips of paper, attaching
as many as ten of these to a single page of the typescript.
\par Canto One of Book Seven has a different background. Early in the
evolution of {\it Savitri}, the third canto of the poem (later, the third book)
was called “Death”. It described the year leading up to Satyavan's death as
well as the fatal day itself. The latest version, with the heading “Book III”, is
incomplete and stops before the last day. Sri Aurobindo used this manuscript
as far as it goes when he put Book Seven, Canto One into its present form.
\par The second half of an earlier “Canto III” had to be used as the
manuscript for Book Eight. It was revised slightly near the beginning and a
substantial passage was dictated at the end. Sri Aurobindo apparently
intended to return to the Book of Death, but this was not to be.
\par On 20 July 1948 he was compelled to admit, “even {\it Savitri} has very
much slowed down and I am only making the last revisions of the First Part
already completed; the other two parts are just now in cold storage.” When
the later parts were taken up again, the most important task remaining was
evidently to bring the almost untouched eleventh book up to the level of what
preceded it. The old “Book VII / Day” on which it would be based was
among the best-developed portions of the early poem. But after thirty years,
Sri Aurobindo had more to say at the climax of {\it Savitri}.
\par There was also the Epilogue; but the contemplated revision of this must
have seemed less essential to the total design. Although a few pages of an
early version were significantly retouched at some stage, the concluding two
sections of the Epilogue stayed almost exactly as they were. Thus the closing
pages of the epic, like most of Book Eight, remained as a sample of the style
in which {\it Savitri} was originally written.
\par Near the end of his life, Sri Aurobindo's eyesight was so poor that he no
longer wrote at all. He made no more drafts for {\it Savitri} and the work
proceeded entirely by dictation. Virtually the whole revision of “The Book of
Everlasting Day” was done in this purely oral manner and may be inferred to
belong to this late period. There exist only a few pages of drafts for it in Sri
Aurobindo's hand, found in note-pads he used around 1946. He was probably
referring to these when he wrote in 1947 that he had already recast “part of
the eleventh” book.
\par Book Eleven culminates in the longest continuous dictated passage in {\it
Savitri}. The passage was written by the scribe in a separate note-pad and
seems to have no antecedent in any previous draft. This is the section which
begins on p. 702 with “Descend to life\sdots  ”, and ends at the bottom of
p. 710 with “This earthly life become the life divine.” Regarding Sri
Aurobindo's dictation in Book Eleven, the scribe reports that “line after line
began to flow from his lips like a smooth and gentle stream and it was on the
next day that a revision was done to get the link for further continuation.”
\par By this time, cantos of Parts Two and Three were coming out in journal
instalments and fascicles like those of Part One. Most of the cantos of Books
Four, Five, Six and Nine were published in this way in 1949-50. Unlike the
fascicles of the first part, they were not revised afterwards by Sri Aurobindo.
\par But in 1948, an extract from Book Six, Canto Two had already been
printed in the {\it Sri Aurobindo Mandir Annual}. An offprint of this was read
to Sri Aurobindo and the changes he dictated were incorporated in a retyped
copy. The painstaking revision of this second typescript was reportedly the
last work he did on {\it Savitri}. A short paragraph before the concluding
description of Narad's departure was the final passage to receive detailed
attention in November 1950, less than a month \NH before Sri Aurobindo's
passing. The thirteen-line paragraph was expanded to the seventy-two lines
beginning “Queen, strive no more to change the secret will.\sdots   ”
\par
\ht Editions of {\it Savitri}
\par Sri Aurobindo revised the proofs of the first edition of Part One, making
numerous final changes and adding more than a hundred new lines. In 1950,
Part One of {\it Savitri} appeared in book form. Parts Two and Three could
not be similarly revised. They came out in 1951 in a second volume, thus
completing the first edition.
\par The second edition was issued in 1954 in one volume under the imprint
of the Sri Aurobindo International University Centre. Some obvious errors in
the text of the first edition were emended at this time. A few of these were
evidently due to the mishearing of Sri Aurobindo's dictation.
\par In 1968, the first edition of Part One was reprinted with some new
textual corrections. The third complete edition (1970) contained further
emendations. Comprising Volumes 28 and 29 of the Sri Aurobindo Birth
Centenary Library, it was also brought out as a single volume in a reduced
format. This was reprinted a number of times between 1973 and 1990.
Several typographical and other errors were rectified in the 1976 impression.
\par The fourth, critically revised edition appeared in 1993. This edition was
the outcome of a systematic comparison of the printed text of {\it Savitri}
with the manuscripts. Each line was traced through all stages of copying,
typing and printing in which errors could have occurred. Readings found to
have come about through inaccurate transcription or misprinting were
corrected. Accidentally omitted lines were restored to the text. This has
resulted in a very slight increase in the length of the poem to its present
23,837 lines.
\par The 1993 edition has been reprinted several times. In 1997 it was
published as volumes 33 and 34 of the Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo.
\par The text of the present, electronic, edition (1999) is identical to the text
of the CWSA edition. As the page breaks in the CWSA edition are almost
everywhere identical to the page breaks in the SABCL edition, the SABCL
page numbers have not been given separately for this book.
