should wish to live a hundred years. Thus it is in thee and not otherwise than

\note{Shankara reads the line, “Thus in thee—it is not otherwise than
thus—action cleaves not to a man.” He interprets \s{karm\=a\,ni} in the first line
in the sense of Vedic sacrifices which are permitted to the ignorant as a
means of escaping from evil actions and their results and attaining to heaven,
but the second \s{karma} in exactly the opposite sense, “evil action”. The
verse, he tells us, represents a concession to the ignorant; the enlightened
soul abandons works and the world and goes to the forest. The whole
expression and construction in this rendering become forced and unnatural.
The rendering I give seems to me the simple and straightforward sense of the
Upanishad.}

\note{\s{M\=atari\'svan} seems to mean “he who extends himself in the Mother
or the container” whether that be the containing mother element, Ether, or
the material energy called Earth in the Veda and spoken of there as the
Mother. It is a Vedic epithet of the God Vayu, who, representing the divine
principle in the Life-energy, Prana, extends himself in Matter and vivifies its
forms. Here it signifies the divine Life-power that presides in all forms of
cosmic activity.} establishes the Waters.
\note{\s{Apas}, as it is accentuated in the version of the White Yajurveda,
can mean only “waters”. If this accentuation is disregarded, we may take it
as the singular \s{apas}, work, action. Shankara, however, renders it by the
plural, works. The difficulty only arises because the true Vedic sense of the
word had been forgotten and it came to be taken as referring to the fourth of
the five elemental states of Matter, the liquid. Such a reference would be
entirely irrelevant to the context. But the Waters, otherwise called the seven
streams or the seven fostering Cows, are the Vedic symbol for the seven
cosmic principles and their activities, three inferior, the physical, vital and
mental, four superior, the divine Truth, the divine Bliss, the divine Will and
Consciousness, and the divine Being. On this conception also is founded the
ancient idea of the seven worlds in each of which the seven principles are
separately active by their various harmonies. This is, obviously, the right
significance of the word in the Upanishad.}

rays are the thoughts that proceed luminously from the Truth, the Vast, but
become deflected and distorted, broken up and disordered in the reflecting
and dividing principle, Mind. They form there the golden lid which covers the
face of the Truth. The Seer prays to Surya to cast them into right order and
relation and then draw them together into the unity of revealed truth. The
result of this inner process is the perception of the oneness of all beings in the

by the good path to the felicity; remove from us the devious attraction of
sin.
\note{Sin, in the conception of the Veda, from which this verse is taken
bodily, is that which excites and hurries the faculties into deviation from the
good path. There is a straight road or road of naturally increasing light and
truth, \s{\,rju\,h panth\=a\,h}, \s{\,rtasya panth\=a\,h}, leading over infinite levels and
towards infinite vistas, \s{v\=it\=ani p\,r\,s\,th\=ani}, by which the law of our nature
should normally take us towards our fulfilment. Sin compels it instead to
travel with stumblings amid uneven and limited tracts and along crooked
windings (\s{durit\=ani}, \s{v\,rjin\=ani}).} To thee completest speech of
submission we would dispose.
\note{The word \s{vidhema} is used of the ordering of the sacrifice, the
disposal of the offerings to the God and, generally, of the sacrifice or worship
itself. The Vedic \s{namas}, internal and external obeisance, is the symbol of
submission to the divine Being in ourselves and in the world. Here the
offering is that of completest submission and the self-surrender of all the
faculties of the lower egoistic human nature to the divine Will-force, Agni, so
that, free from internal opposition, it may lead the soul of man through the
truth towards a felicity full of the spiritual riches, \s{r\=aye}. That state of
beatitude is the intended self-content in the principle of pure Love and Joy,
which the Vedic initiates regarded as the source of the divine existence in the
universe and the foundation of the divine life in the human being. It is the
deformation of this principle by egoism which appears as desire and the lust
of possession in the lower worlds.}

\ht The Opposites
\par The pairs of opposites successively taken up by the Upanishad and
resolved are, in the order of their succession:
\par 1. The Conscious Lord and phenomenal Nature.
\par 2. Renunciation and Enjoyment.
\par 3. Action in Nature and Freedom in the Soul.
Page 91

\par 4. The One stable Brahman and the multiple Movement.
\par 5. Being and Becoming.
\par 6. The Active Lord and the indifferent Akshara Brahman.
\par 7. Vidya and Avidya.
\par 8. Birth and Non-Birth.
\par 9. Works and Knowledge.
\par These discords are thus successively resolved:
\par















\par
\ht God and Nature
\par 1. Phenomenal Nature is a movement of the conscious Lord. The object
of the movement is to create forms of His consciousness in motion in which
He as the one soul in many bodies can take up his habitation and enjoy the
multiplicity and the movement with all their relations.
\note{This is also the view of the Gita and generally accepted.}
\par
\tscc Enjoyment and Renunciation
\par 2. Real integral enjoyment of all this movement and multiplicity in its
truth and in its infinity depends upon an absolute renunciation; but the
renunciation intended is an absolute renunciation of the principle of desire
founded on the principle of egoism and not a renunciation of
world-existence.
\note{This, again, is the central standpoint of the Gita, which, however,
admits also the renunciation of world-existence. The general trend of
Vedantic thought would accept the renunciation of desire and egoism as the
essential but would hold that renunciation of egoism means the renunciation
of all world-existence, for it sees desire and not Ananda as the cause of
world existence.} This solution depends on the idea that desire is only an
egoistic and vital deformation of the divine Ananda or delight of being from
which the world is born; by extirpation of ego and desire Ananda again
becomes the conscious principle of existence. This substitution is the essence
of the change from life in death to life in immortality. The enjoyment of the
infinite delight of existence free from ego, founded on oneness of all in the
Lord, is what is meant by the enjoyment of Immortality.

\par\sitem{2.} The soul is the bird that sits immersed on the one common

he sees that other who is the Lord and beloved, he knows that all is His
greatness and his sorrow passes away from him.

\par\sitem{3.} When, a seer, he sees the Golden-hued, the maker, the Lord,
the Spirit who is the source of Brahman,
\note{Or, “whose source is Brahman”; Shankara admits the other meaning
as an alternative, but explains it as “the source of the lower Brahman”.} then
he becomes the knower and shakes from his wings sin and virtue; pure of all
stain he reaches the supreme identity.

\par\sitem{5.} The Self can always be won by truth, by self-discipline, by
integral knowledge, by a life of purity,—this Self that is in the inner body,
radiant, made all of light whom, by the perishing of their blemishes, the doers
of askesis behold.

\par\sitem{7.} Vast is That, divine, its form unthinkable; it shines out subtler
than the subtle:

here close to us, for those who have vision it is even here in this world; it is
here, hidden in the secret heart.

\par\sitem{8.} Eye cannot seize, speech cannot grasp Him, nor these other

being is purified by a glad serenity of

}
\par\sitem{9.} This self is subtle and has to be known by a thought-mind into
which the life-force has made its fivefold entry: all the conscious heart of
creatures is shot through and inwoven with the currents of the life-force and
only when it is purified can this Self manifest its power.

mean, “to manifest its full power and pervading presence”.}

in which shines out, inset, the radiant world. The wise who are without desire
and worship the Spirit pass beyond this sperm.
\note{Shankara takes it so in the sense of {\it semen virile,} which is the

in this world vanish away all desires.

with error in the seeking, nor by an askesis without the true mark: but when a
man of knowledge strives by these means his Self enters into Brahman, his
abiding place.

purified by the Yoga of renunciation, all in the hour of their last end passing
beyond death are released into the worlds of the Brahman.
