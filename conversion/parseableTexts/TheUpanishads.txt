\ht Publisher's Note
\par\nodrop The present volume comprises Sri Aurobindo's final translations
of and commentaries on the Isha and Kena Upanishads, his final translations
of the Mundaka and Katha Upanishads, and a commentary on part of the
Taittiriya Upanishad. They are preceded by a chapter on the Upanishads
from {\it A Defence of Indian Culture}. These works represent Sri
Aurobindo's Upanishadic interpretation in its most mature and finished form.
All were written after he settled in Pondicherry in 1910. Translations and
commentaries written before that year, or left incomplete by the author, have
not been included in this volume. They are available in other publications.

\ht Introduction
\par\drop The Upanishads are the supreme work of the Indian mind, and that
it should be so, that the highest self-expression of its genius, its sublimest
poetry, its greatest creation of the thought and word should be not a literary
or poetical masterpiece of the ordinary kind, but a large flood of spiritual
revelation of this direct and profound character, is a significant fact, evidence
of a unique mentality and unusual turn of spirit. The Upanishads are at once
profound religious scriptures,—for they are a record of the deepest spiritual
experiences,—documents of revelatory and intuitive philosophy of an
inexhaustible light, power and largeness and, whether written in verse or
cadenced prose, spiritual poems of an absolute, an unfailing inspiration
inevitable in phrase, wonderful in rhythm and expression. It is the expression
of a mind in which philosophy and religion and poetry are made one, because
this religion does not end with a cult nor is limited to a religio-ethical
aspiration, but rises to an infinite discovery of God, of Self, of our highest and
whole reality of spirit and being and speaks out of an ecstasy of luminous
knowledge and an ecstasy of moved and fulfilled experience, this philosophy
is not an abstract intellectual speculation about Truth or a structure of the
logical intelligence, but Truth seen, felt, lived, held by the inmost mind and
soul in the joy of utterance of an assured discovery and possession, and this
poetry is the work of the aesthetic mind lifted up beyond its ordinary field to
express the wonder and beauty of the rarest spiritual self-vision and the
profoundest illumined truth of self and God and universe. Here the intuitive
mind and intimate psychological experience of the Vedic seers passes into a
supreme culmination in which the Spirit, as is said in a phrase of the Katha
Upanishad, discloses its own very body, reveals the very word of its
self-expression and discovers to the mind the vibration of rhythms which
repeating themselves within in the spiritual hearing seem to build up the soul
and set it satisfied and complete on the heights of self-knowledge.

\par This character of the Upanishads needs to be insisted upon with a strong
emphasis, because it is ignored by foreign translators who seek to bring out
the intellectual sense without feeling the life of thought vision and the ecstasy
of spiritual experience which made the ancient verses appear then and still
make them to those who can enter into the element in which these utterances
move, a revelation not to the intellect alone, but to the soul and the whole
being, make of them in the old expressive word not intellectual thought and
phrase, but sruti, spiritual audience, an inspired Scripture. The philosophical
substance of the Upanishads demands at this day no farther stress of
appreciation of its value; for even if the amplest acknowledgement by the
greatest minds were wanting, the whole history of philosophy would be there
to offer its evidence. The Upanishads have been the acknowledged source of
numerous profound philosophies and religions that flowed from it in India like
her great rivers from their Himalayan cradle fertilising the mind and life of
the people and kept its soul alive through the long procession of the centuries,
constantly returned to for light, never failing to give fresh illumination, a
fountain of inexhaustible life-giving waters. Buddhism with all its
developments was only a restatement, although from a new standpoint and
with fresh terms of intellectual definition and reasoning, of one side of its
experience and it carried it thus changed in form but hardly in substance over
all Asia and westward towards Europe. The ideas of the Upanishads can be
rediscovered in much of the thought of Pythagoras and Plato and form the
profoundest part of Neo-platonism and Gnosticism with all their considerable
consequences to the philosophical thinking of the West, and Sufism only
repeats them in another religious language. The larger part of German
metaphysics is little more in substance than an intellectual development of
great realities more spiritually seen in this ancient teaching, and modern
thought is rapidly absorbing them with a closer, more living and intense
receptiveness which promises a revolution both in philosophical and in
religious thinking; here they are filtering in through many indirect influences,
there slowly pouring through direct and open channels. There is hardly a main
philosophical idea which cannot find an authority or a seed or indication in
Page 2

these antique writings—the speculations, according to a certain view, of
thinkers who had no better past or background to their thought than a crude,
barbaric, naturalistic and animistic ignorance. And even the larger
generalisations of Science are constantly found to apply to the truth of
physical Nature formulas already discovered by the Indian sages in their
original, their largest meaning in the deeper truth of the spirit.
\par And yet these works are not philosophical speculations of the intellectual
kind, a metaphysical analysis which labours to define notions, to select ideas
and discriminate those that are true, to logicise truth or else to support the
mind in its intellectual preferences by dialectical reasoning and is content to
put forward an exclusive solution of existence in the light of this or that idea
of the reason and see all things from that viewpoint, in that focus and
determining perspective. The Upanishads could not have had so undying a
vitality, exercised so unfailing an influence, produced such results or seen
now their affirmations independently justified in other spheres of inquiry and
by quite opposite methods, if they had been of that character. It is because
these seers saw Truth rather than merely thought it, clothed it indeed with a
strong body of intuitive idea and disclosing image, but a body of ideal
transparency through which we look into the illimitable, because they
fathomed things in the light of self-existence and saw them with the eye of
the Infinite, that their words remain always alive and immortal, of an
inexhaustible significance, an inevitable authenticity, a satisfying finality that is
at the same time an infinite commencement of truth, to which all our lines of
investigation when they go through to their end arrive again and to which
humanity constantly returns in its minds and its ages of greatest vision. The
Upanishads are Vedanta, a book of knowledge in a higher degree even than
the Vedas, but knowledge in the profounder Indian sense of the word, Jnana.
Not a mere thinking and considering by the intelligence, the pursuit and
grasping of a mental form of truth by the intellectual mind, but a seeing of it
with the soul and a total living in it with the power of the inner being, a
spiritual seizing by a kind of identification with the object of knowledge is
Jnana. And because it is only by an integral knowing of the self that this kind
of direct
Page 3

knowledge can be made complete, it was the self that the Vedantic sages
sought to know, to live in and to be one with it by identity. And through this
endeavour they came easily to see that the self in us is one with the universal
self of all things and that this self again is the same as God and Brahman, a
transcendent Being or Existence, and they beheld, felt, lived in the inmost
truth of all things in the universe and the inmost truth of man's inner and outer
existence by the light of this one and unifying vision. The Upanishads are epic
hymns of self-knowledge and world-knowledge and God-knowledge. The
great formulations of philosophic truth with which they abound are not
abstract intellectual generalisations, things that may shine and enlighten the
mind, but do not live and move the soul to ascension, but are ardours as well
as lights of an intuitive and revelatory illumination, reachings as well as
seeings of the one Existence, the transcendent Godhead, the divine and
universal Self and discoveries of his relation with things and creatures in this
great cosmic manifestation. Chants of inspired knowledge, they breathe like
all hymns a tone of religious aspiration and ecstasy, not of the narrowly
intense kind proper to a lesser religious feeling, but raised beyond cult and
special forms of devotion to the universal Ananda of the Divine which comes
to us by approach to and oneness with the self-existent and universal spirit.
And though mainly concerned with an inner vision and not directly with
outward human action, all the highest ethics of Buddhism and later Hinduism
are still emergences of the very life and significance of the truths to which
they give expressive form and force,—and there is something greater than
any ethical precept and mental rule of virtue, the supreme ideal of a spiritual
action founded on oneness with God and all living beings. Therefore even
when the life of the forms of the Vedic cult had passed away, the
Upanishads still remained alive and creative and could generate the great
devotional religions and motive the persistent Indian idea of the Dharma.
\par The Upanishads are the creation of a revelatory and intuitive mind and
its illumined experience, and all their substance, structure, phrase, imagery,
movement are determined by and stamped with this original character. These
supreme and all-embracing
Page 4

truths, these visions of oneness and self and a universal divine being are cast
into brief and monumental phrases which bring them at once before the soul's
eye and make them real and imperative to its aspiration and experience or
are couched in poetic sentences full of revealing power and suggestive
thought-colour that discover a whole infinite through a finite image. The One
is there revealed, but also disclosed the many aspects, and each is given its
whole significance by the amplitude of the expression and finds as if in a
spontaneous self-discovery its place and its connection by the illumining
justness of each word and all the phrase. The largest metaphysical truths and
the subtlest subtleties of psychological experience are taken up into the
inspired movement and made at once precise to the seeing mind and loaded
with unending suggestion to the discovering spirit. There are separate
phrases, single couplets, brief passages which contain each in itself the
substance of a vast philosophy and yet each is only thrown out as a side, an
aspect, a portion of the infinite self-knowledge. All here is a packed and
pregnant and yet perfectly lucid and luminous brevity and an immeasurable
completeness. A thought of this kind cannot follow the tardy, careful and
diffuse development of the logical intelligence. The passage, the sentence, the
couplet, the line, even the half line follows the one that precedes with a
certain interval full of an unexpressed thought, an echoing silence between
them, a thought which is carried in the total suggestion and implied in the step
itself, but which the mind is left to work out for its own profit, and these
intervals of pregnant silence are large, the steps of this thought are like the
paces of a Titan striding from rock to distant rock across infinite waters.
There is a perfect totality, a comprehensive connection of harmonious parts
in the structure of each Upanishad; but it is done in the way of a mind that
sees masses of truth at a time and stops to bring only the needed word out of
a filled silence. The rhythm in verse or cadenced prose corresponds to the
sculpture of the thought and the phrase. The metrical forms of the
Upanishads are made up of four half lines each clearly cut, the lines mostly
complete in themselves and integral in sense, the half lines presenting two
thoughts or distinct parts of a thought that are wedded to and complete each
other, and the
Page 5

sound movement follows a corresponding principle, each step brief and
marked off by the distinctness of its pause, full of echoing cadences that
remain long vibrating in the inner hearing: each is as if a wave of the infinite
that carries in it the whole voice and rumour of the ocean. It is a kind of
poetry—word of vision, rhythm of the spirit,—that has not been written
before or after.
\par The imagery of the Upanishads is in large part developed from the type
of imagery of the Veda and though very ordinarily it prefers an unveiled
clarity of directly illuminative image, not unoften also it uses the same
symbols in a way that is closely akin to the spirit and to the less technical part
of the method of the older symbolism. It is to a great extent this element no
longer seizable by our way of thinking that has baffled certain Western
scholars and made them cry out that these scriptures are a mixture of the
sublimest philosophical speculations with the first awkward stammerings of
the child mind of humanity. The Upanishads are not a revolutionary departure
from the Vedic mind and its temperament and fundamental ideas, but a
continuation and development and to a certain extent an enlarging
transformation in the sense of bringing out into open expression all that was
held covered in the symbolic Vedic speech as a mystery and a secret. It
begins by taking up the imagery and the ritual symbols of the Veda and the
Brahmanas and turning them in such a way as to bring out an inner and a
mystic sense which will serve as a sort of psychical starting-point for its own
more highly evolved and more purely spiritual philosophy. There are a
number of passages especially in the prose Upanishads which are entirely of
this kind and deal, in a manner recondite, obscure and even unintelligible to
the modern understanding, with the psychic sense of ideas then current in the
Vedic religious mind, the distinction between the three kinds of Veda, the
three worlds and other similar subjects; but, leading as they do in the thought
of the Upanishads to deepest spiritual truths, these passages cannot be
dismissed as childish aberrations of the intelligence void of sense or of any
discoverable bearing on the higher thought in which they culminate. On the
contrary we find that they have a deep enough significance once we can get
inside their symbolic
Page 6

meaning. That appears in a psycho-physical passing upward into a
psycho-spiritual knowledge for which we would now use more intellectual,
less concrete and imaged terms, but which is still valid for those who practise
Yoga and rediscover the secrets of our psycho-physical and psycho-spiritual
being. Typical passages of this kind of peculiar expression of psychic truths
are Ajatashatru's explanation of sleep and dream or the passages of the
Prasna Upanishad on the vital principle and its motions, or those in which the
Vedic idea of the struggle between the Gods and the demons is taken up and
given its spiritual significance and the Vedic godheads more openly than in
Rik and Saman characterised and invoked in their inner function and spiritual
power.
\par I may cite as an example of this development of Vedic idea and image a
passage of the Taittiriya in which Indra plainly appears as the power and
godhead of the divine mind:
\par
\BF He who is the Bull of the Vedas of the universal form, he who was born
in the sacred rhythms from the Immortal,—may Indra satisfy me through the
intelligence. O God, may I become a vessel of the Immortal. May my body
be full of vision and my tongue of sweetness, may I hear the much and vast
with my ears. For thou art the sheath of Brahman covered over and hidden
by the intelligence.
\par
\PF And a kindred passage may also be cited from the Isha in which Surya
the Sun-God is invoked as the godhead of knowledge whose supreme form of
effulgence is the oneness of the Spirit and his rays dispersed here on the
mental level are the \NH shining diffusion of the thought mind and conceal his
own infinite supramental truth, the body and self of this Sun, the truth of the
spirit and the Eternal:
\par
\BF The face of the Truth is covered with a golden lid: O fostering Sun, that
uncover for the law of the truth, for sight. O fosterer, O sole Rishi, O
controlling Yama, O Surya, O son of the Father of creatures, marshal and
mass thy rays: the Lustre that is thy most blessed form of all,
Page 7

that I see, He who is this, this Purusha, He am I.
\par
\PF The kinship in difference of these passages with the imagery and style of
the Veda is evident and the last indeed paraphrases or translates into a later
and more open style a Vedic verse of the Atris:
\par
\BF Hidden by your truth is the Truth that is constant for ever where they
unyoke the horses of the Sun. There the ten thousands stand together, That is
the One: I have seen the supreme Godhead of the embodied gods.
\par
\PF This Vedic and Vedantic imagery is foreign to our present mentality
which does not believe in the living truth of the symbol, because the revealing
imagination intimidated by the intellect has no longer the courage to accept,
identify itself with and boldly embody a psychic and spiritual vision; but it is
certainly very far from being a childish or a primitive and barbarous
mysticism; this vivid, living, luminously poetic intuitive language is rather the
natural expression of a highly evolved spiritual culture.
\par The intuitive thought of the Upanishads starts from this concrete imagery
and these symbols, first to the Vedic Rishis secret seer words wholly
expressive to the mind of the seer but veils of their deepest sense to the
ordinary intelligence, link them to a less covertly expressive language and
pass beyond them to another magnificently open and sublime imagery and
diction which at once reveals the spiritual truth in all its splendour. The prose
Upanishads show us this process of the early mind of India at its work using
the symbol and then passing beyond it to the overt expression of the spiritual
significance. A passage of the Prasna Upanishad on the power and
significance of the mystic syllable AUM illustrates the earlier stage of the
process:
\par
\BF This syllable OM, O Satyakama, it is the supreme and it is the lower
Brahman. Therefore the man of knowledge passeth by this house of the
Brahman to the one or the other. And if one meditate on the single letter, he
getteth by it knowledge and soon he attaineth on the earth. And him the
Page 8

Riks lead to the world of men and there perfected in Tapas and
Brahmacharya and faith he experienceth the greatness of the spirit. Now if
by the double letter he is accomplished in the mind, then is he led up by the
Yajus to the middle world, to the moon-world of Soma. He in the world of
Soma experienceth the majesty of the spirit and returneth again. And he who
by the triple letter again, even this syllable OM, shall meditate on the highest
Purusha, is perfected in the light that is the Sun. As a snake putteth off its
skin, even so is he released from sin and evil and is led by the Samans to the
world of Brahman. He from this dense of living souls seeth the higher than
the highest Purusha who lieth in this mansion. The three letters are afflicted
by death, but now they are used undivided and united to each other, then are
the inner and the outer and the middle action of the spirit made whole in their
perfect using and the spirit knows and is not shaken. This world by the Riks,
the middle world by the Yajus and by the Samans that which the seers make
known to us. The man of knowledge passeth to Him by OM, his house, even
to the supreme spirit that is calm and ageless and fearless and immortal.
\par
\PF The symbols here are still obscure to our intelligence, but indications are
given which show beyond doubt that they are representations of a psychical
experience leading to different states of spiritual realisation and we can see
that these are three, outward, mental and supramental, and as the result of
the last a supreme perfection, a complete and integral action of the whole
being in the tranquil eternity of the immortal Spirit. And later in the Mandukya
Upanishad the other symbols are cast aside and we are admitted to the
unveiled significance. Then there emerges a knowledge to which modern
thought is returning through its own very different intellectual, rational and
scientific method, the knowledge that behind the operations of our outward
physical consciousness are working the operations of another,
subliminal,—another and yet the same,—of which our waking mind is a
surface action, and above—perhaps, we still say—is a spiritual
superconscience in which can be found, it may well be, the
Page 9

highest state and the whole secret of our being. We shall see, when we look
closely at the passage of the Prasna Upanishad, that this knowledge is
already there, and I think we can very rationally conclude that these and
similar utterances of the ancient sages, however perplexing their form to the
rational mind, cannot be dismissed as a childish mysticism, but are the imaged
expression, natural to the mentality of the time, of what the reason itself by its
own processes is now showing us to be true and a very profound truth and
real reality of knowledge.
\par The metrical Upanishads continue this highly charged symbolism but
carry it more lightly and in the bulk of their verses pass beyond this kind of
image to the overt expression. The Self, the Spirit, the Godhead in man and
creatures and Nature and all this world and in other worlds and beyond all
cosmos, the Immortal, the One, the Infinite is hymned without veils in the
splendour of his eternal transcendence and his manifold self-revelation. A
few passages from the teachings of Yama, lord of the Law and of Death, to
Nachiketas, will be enough to illustrate something of their character. \bigskip
\par
\BF OM is this syllable. This syllable is the Brahman, this syllable is the
Supreme. He who knoweth the imperishable OM, whatso he willeth, it is his.
This support is the best, this support is the highest; and when a man knoweth
it, he is greatened in the world of Brahman. The omniscient is not born, nor
dies, nor has he come into being from anywhere, nor is he anyone. He is
unborn, he is constant and eternal, he is the Ancient of Days who is not slain
in the slaying of the body.\sdots 
\par
\BI He is seated and journeys far, and lying still he goes to every side. Who
other than I should know this ecstatic Godhead? The wise man cometh to
know the great Lord and Self established and bodiless in these bodies that
pass and has grief no longer. This Self is not to be won by teaching nor by
brain-power nor by much learning: he whom the Spirit chooses, by him alone
it can be won, and to him this Spirit discloses its own very body. One who
has not ceased from ill-doing, one who is not concentrated and calm, one
whose
Page 10

mind is not tranquil, shall not get him by the brain's wisdom. He of whom
warriors and sages are the food and death is the spice of his banquet, who
knoweth where is He?\sdots 
\par
\BI The Self-born has cloven his doors outward, therefore man sees outward
and not in the inner self: only a wise man here and there turns his eyes
inward, desiring immortality, and looks on the Self face to face. The child
minds follow after surface desires and fall into the net of death which is
spread wide for us; but the wise know of immortality and ask not from things
inconstant that which is constant. One knoweth by this Self form and taste
and odour and touch and its pleasures and what then is here left over? The
wise man cometh to know the great Lord and Self by whom one seeth all
that is in the soul that wakes and all that is in the soul that dreams and hath
grief no longer. He who knoweth the Self, the eater of sweetness close to the
living being, the lord of what was and what will be, shrinks thereafter from
nothing that is. He knoweth him who is that which was born of old from
Tapas and who was born of old from the waters and hath entered in and
standeth in the secret cavern of being with all these creatures. He knoweth
her who is born by the life force, the infinite Mother with all the gods in her,
her who hath entered in and standeth in the secret cavern of being with all
these creatures. This is the Fire that hath the knowledge and it is hidden in
the two tinders as the embryo is borne in pregnant women; this is the Fire
that must be adored by men watching sleeplessly and bringing to him the
offering. He is that from which the Sun rises and that in which it sets: and in
him all the gods are founded and none can pass beyond him. What is here,
even that is in other worlds, and what is there, even according to that is all
that is here. He goes from death to death who sees here only difference. A
Purusha no bigger than a thumb stands in man's central self and is the lord of
what was and what shall be, and knowing him thenceforth one shrinks from
nothing that is. A Purusha no bigger than a man's thumb and he is like a light
without smoke; he is the Lord of what
Page 11

was and what shall be; it is he that is today and it is he that shall be
tomorrow. \bigskip
\par
\PI The Upanishads abound with passages which are at once poetry and
spiritual philosophy, of an absolute clarity and beauty, but no translation empty
of the suggestions and the grave and subtle and luminous sense echoes of the
original words and rhythms can give any idea of their power and perfection.
There are others in which the subtlest psychological and philosophical truths
are expressed with an entire sufficiency without falling short of a perfect
beauty of poetical expression and always so as to live to the mind and soul
and not merely be presented to the understanding intelligence. There is in
some of the prose Upanishads another element of vivid narrative and tradition
which restores for us though only in brief glimpses the picture of that
extraordinary stir and movement of spiritual enquiry and passion for the
highest knowledge which made the Upanishads possible. The scenes of the
old world live before us in a few pages, the sages sitting in their groves ready
to test and teach the comer, princes and learned Brahmins and great landed
nobles going about in search of knowledge, the king's son in his chariot and
the illegitimate son of the servant-girl, seeking any man who might carry in
himself the thought of light and the word of revelation, the typical figures and
personalities, Janaka and the subtle mind of Ajatashatru, Raikwa of the cart,
Yajnavalkya militant for truth, calm and ironic, taking to himself with both
hands without attachment worldly possessions and spiritual riches and casting
at last all his wealth behind to wander forth as a houseless ascetic, Krishna
son of Devaki who heard a single word of the Rishi Ghora and knew at once
the Eternal, the ashramas, the courts of kings who were also spiritual
discoverers and thinkers, the great sacrificial assemblies where the sages met
and compared their knowledge. And we see how the soul of India was born
and how arose this great birth-song in which it soared from its earth into the
supreme empyrean of the spirit. The Vedas and the Upanishads are not only
the sufficient fountain-head of Indian philosophy and religion, but of all Indian
art, poetry and literature. It was the soul, the temperament, the ideal mind
formed
Page 12

and expressed in them which later carved out the great philosophies, built the
structure of the Dharma, recorded its heroic youth in the Mahabharata and
Ramayana, intellectualised indefatigably in the classical times of the ripeness
of its manhood, threw out so many original intuitions in science, created so
rich a glow of aesthetic and vital and sensuous experience, renewed its
spiritual and psychic experience in Tantra and Purana, flung itself into
grandeur and beauty of line and colour, hewed and cast its thought and vision
in stone and bronze, poured itself into new channels of self-expression in the
later tongues and now after eclipse reemerges always the same in difference
and ready for a new life and a new creation.

worn as garment” and “to be inhabited”. The first is the ordinarily accepted
meaning. Shankara explains it in this significance, that we must lose the sense
of this unreal objective universe in the sole perception of the pure Brahman.
So explained the first line becomes a contradiction of the whole thought of
the Upanishad which teaches the reconciliation, by the perception of essential
Unity, of the apparently incompatible opposites, God and the World,
Renunciation and Enjoyment, Action and internal Freedom, the One and the
Many, Being and its Becomings, the passive divine Impersonality and the
active divine Personality, the Knowledge and the Ignorance, the Becoming
and the Not-Becoming, Life on earth and beyond and the supreme
Immortality. The image is of the world either as a garment or as a
dwelling-place for the informing and governing Spirit. The latter significance
agrees better with the thought of the Upanishad.} by the Lord, whatsoever is

\note{Shankara reads the line, “Thus in thee—it is not otherwise than
thus—action cleaves not to a man.” He interprets \s{karm\=a\,ni} in the first line
in the sense of Vedic sacrifices which are permitted to the ignorant as a
means of escaping from evil actions and their results and attaining to heaven,
but the second \s{karma} in exactly the opposite sense, “evil action”. The
verse, he tells us, represents a concession to the ignorant; the enlightened
soul abandons works and the world and goes to the forest. The whole
expression and construction in this rendering become forced and unnatural.

starting-point for the final movement in the last four verses. Its suggestions
are there taken up and worked out. The prayer to the Sun refers back in
thought to the sunless worlds and their blind gloom, which are recalled in the
ninth and twelfth verses. The sun and his rays are intimately connected in
other Upanishads also with the worlds of Light and their natural opposite is

\note{\s{Apas}, as it is accentuated in the version of the White Yajurveda,
can mean only “waters”. If this accentuation is disregarded, we may take it
as the singular \s{apas}, work, action. Shankara, however, renders it by the
plural, works. The difficulty only arises because the true Vedic sense of the
word had been forgotten and it came to be taken as referring to the fourth of
the five elemental states of Matter, the liquid. Such a reference would be
entirely irrelevant to the context. But the Waters, otherwise called the seven
streams or the seven fostering Cows, are the Vedic symbol for the seven
cosmic principles and their activities, three inferior, the physical, vital and
mental, four superior, the divine Truth, the divine Bliss, the divine Will and
Consciousness, and the divine Being. On this conception also is founded the
ancient idea of the seven worlds in each of which the seven principles are
separately active by their various harmonies. This is, obviously, the right
significance of the word in the Upanishad.}

and dividing principle, Mind. They form there the golden lid which covers the
face of the Truth. The Seer prays to Surya to cast them into right order and
relation and then draw them together into the unity of revealed truth. The
result of this inner process is the perception of the oneness of all beings in the

\note{Sin, in the conception of the Veda, from which this verse is taken
bodily, is that which excites and hurries the faculties into deviation from the
good path. There is a straight road or road of naturally increasing light and
truth, \s{\,rju\,h panth\=a\,h}, \s{\,rtasya panth\=a\,h}, leading over infinite levels and
towards infinite vistas, \s{v\=it\=ani p\,r\,s\,th\=ani}, by which the law of our nature
should normally take us towards our fulfilment. Sin compels it instead to
travel with stumblings amid uneven and limited tracts and along crooked
windings (\s{durit\=ani}, \s{v\,rjin\=ani}).} To thee completest speech of
submission we would dispose.
\note{The word \s{vidhema} is used of the ordering of the sacrifice, the
disposal of the offerings to the God and, generally, of the sacrifice or worship
itself. The Vedic \s{namas}, internal and external obeisance, is the symbol of
submission to the divine Being in ourselves and in the world. Here the
offering is that of completest submission and the self-surrender of all the
faculties of the lower egoistic human nature to the divine Will-force, Agni, so
that, free from internal opposition, it may lead the soul of man through the
truth towards a felicity full of the spiritual riches, \s{r\=aye}. That state of
beatitude is the intended self-content in the principle of pure Love and Joy,
which the Vedic initiates regarded as the source of the divine existence in the
universe and the foundation of the divine life in the human being. It is the
deformation of this principle by egoism which appears as desire and the lust
of possession in the lower worlds.}

\ht Plan of the Upanishad
\par\drop The Upanishads, being vehicles of illumination and not of
instruction, composed for seekers who had already a general familiarity with
the ideas of the Vedic and Vedantic seers and even some personal
experience of the truths on which they were founded, dispense in their style
with expressed transitions of thought and the development of implied or
subordinate notions.
\par Every verse in the Isha Upanishad reposes on a number of ideas implicit
in the text but nowhere set forth explicitly; the reasoning also that supports its
conclusions is suggested by the words, not expressly conveyed to the
intelligence. The reader, or rather the hearer, was supposed to proceed from
light to light, confirming his intuitions and verifying by his experience, not
submitting the ideas to the judgment of the logical reason.
\par To the modern mind this method is invalid and inapplicable; it is
necessary to present the ideas of the Upanishad in their completeness,
underline the suggestions, supply the necessary transitions and bring out the
suppressed but always implicit reasoning.
\par The central idea of the Upanishad, which is a reconciliation and harmony
of fundamental opposites, is worked out symmetrically in four successive
movements of thought.

\sect3
\par
\ht First Movement
\par In the first, a basis is laid down by the idea of the one and stable Spirit
inhabiting and governing a universe of movement and of the forms of
movement. ({\it Verse 1, line 1})
\par On this conception the rule of a divine life for man is
founded,—enjoyment of all by renunciation of all through the exclusion of
desire. ({\it Verse 1, line 2})
\par There is then declared the justification of works and of the
Page 27

physical life on the basis of an inalienable freedom of the soul, one with the
Lord, amidst all the activity of the multiple movement. ({\it Verse 2})
\par Finally, the result of an ignorant interference with the right manifestation
of the One in the multiplicity is declared to be an involution in states of blind
obscurity after death. ({\it Verse 3})
\par
\ht Second Movement
\par In the second movement the ideas of the first verse are resumed and
amplified.
\par The one stable Lord and the multiple movement are identified as one
Brahman of whom, however, the unity and stability are the higher truth and
who contains all as well as inhabits all. ({\it Verses 4, 5})
\par The basis and fulfilment of the rule of life are found in the experience of
unity by which man identifies himself with the cosmic and transcendental Self
and is identified in the Self, but with an entire freedom from grief and illusion,
with all its becomings. ({\it Verses 6, 7})
\par
\ht Third Movement
\par In the third movement there is a return to the justification of life and
works (the subject of {\it verse 2}) and an indication of their divine fulfilment.
\par The degrees of the Lord's self-manifestation in the universe of motion
and in the becomings of the one Being are set forth and the inner law of all
existences declared to be by His conception and determination. ({\it Verse
8})
\par Vidya and Avidya, Becoming and Non-becoming are reconciled by their
mutual utility to the progressive self-realisation which proceeds from the state
of mortality to the state of Immortality. ({\it Verses 9–14})
\par
\ht Fourth Movement
\par The fourth movement returns to the idea of the worlds and under the
figures of Surya and Agni the relations of the Supreme Truth and Immortality
({\it Verses 15, 16}), the activities of this life ({\it Verse 17}), and the state
after death ({\it Verse 18}) are symbolically indicated.

\ht The Inhabiting Godhead: Life and Action

\sect3
\par
\ht Verses 1–3
\note{1. All this is for habitation by the Lord, whatsoever is individual
universe of movement in the universal motion. By that renounced thou
shouldst enjoy; lust not after any man's possession. \nl\fnquad   2. Doing
verily works in this world one should wish to live a hundred years. Thus it is

3. Sunless are those worlds and enveloped in blind gloom whereto all they in

\par
\ht The Basis of Cosmic Existence
\par God and the world, Spirit and formative Nature are confronted and their
relations fixed.
\par
\ht Cosmos
\par All world is a movement of the Spirit in itself and is mutable and
transient in all its formations and appearances; its only eternity is an eternity
of recurrence, its only stability a semblance caused by certain apparent
fixities of relation and grouping.
\par Every separate object in the universe is, in truth, itself the whole universe
presenting a certain front or outward appearance of its movement. The
microcosm is one with the macrocosm.
\par Yet in their relation of principle of movement and result of movement
they are continent and contained, world in world, movement in movement.
The individual therefore partakes of the nature of the universal, refers back
to it for its source of activity, is, as we say, subject to its laws and part of
cosmic Nature.
\par
\ht Spirit
\par Spirit is lord of its movement, one, immutable, free, stable and eternal.
\par The Movement with all its formed objects has been created in order to
provide a habitation for the Spirit who, being One,
Page 29

yet dwells multitudinously in the multiplicity of His mansions.
\par It is the same Lord who dwells in the sum and the part, in the Cosmos as
a whole and in each being, force or object in the Cosmos.
\par Since He is one and indivisible, the Spirit in all is one and their multiplicity
is a play of His cosmic consciousness.
\par Therefore each human being is in his essence one with all others, free,
eternal, immutable, lord of Nature.
\par\bl
\ht Transitional Thought: Avidya
\par The object of habitation is enjoyment and possession; the object of the
Spirit in Cosmos is, therefore, the possession and enjoyment of the universe.
Yet, being thus in his essence one, divine and free, man seems to be limited,
divided from others, subject to Nature and even its creation and sport,
enslaved to death, ignorance and sorrow. His object in manifestation being
possession and enjoyment of his world, he is unable to enjoy because of his
limitation. This contrary result comes about by Avidya, the Ignorance of
oneness: and the knot of the Ignorance is egoism.
\par
\ht Ego
\par The cause of ego is that while by Its double power of Vidya and Avidya
the Spirit dwells at once in the consciousness of multiplicity and relativity and
in the consciousness of unity and identity and is therefore not bound by the
Ignorance, yet It can, in mind, identify Itself with the object in the movement,
absorbingly, to the apparent exclusion of the Knowledge which remains
behind, veiled at the back of the mentality. The movement of Mind in Nature
is thus able to conceive of the object as the reality and the Inhabitant as
limited and determined by the appearances of the object. It conceives of the
object, not as the universe in one of its frontal appearances, but as itself a
separate existence standing out from the Cosmos and different in being from
all the rest of it. It conceives similarly of the Inhabitant. This is the illusion of
ignorance which falsifies all realities. The illusion is called \s{aha\.mk\=ara}, the
separative ego-sense which
Page 30

makes each being conceive of itself as an independent personality.
\par The result of the separation is the inability to enter into harmony and
oneness with the universe and a consequent inability to possess and enjoy it.
But the desire to possess and enjoy is the master impulse of the Ego which
knows itself obscurely to be the Lord, although owing to the limitations of its
relativity, it is unable to realise its true existence. The result is discord with
others and oneself, mental and physical suffering, the sense of weakness and
inability, the sense of obscuration, the straining of energy in passion and in
desire towards self-fulfilment, the recoil of energy exhausted or disappointed
towards death and disintegration.
\par Desire is the badge of subjection with its attendant discord and suffering.
That which is free, one and lord, does not desire, but inalienably contains,
possesses and enjoys.
\par
\ht The Rule of the Divine Life
\par Enjoyment of the universe and all it contains is the object of
world-existence, but renunciation of all in desire is the condition of the free
enjoyment of all.
\par The renunciation demanded is not a moral constraint of self-denial or a
physical rejection, but an entire liberation of the spirit from any craving after
the forms of things.
\par The terms of this liberation are freedom from egoism and, consequently,
freedom from personal desire. Practically, this \NH renunciation implies that
one should not regard anything in the universe as a necessary object of
possession, nor as possessed by another and not by oneself, nor as an object
of greed in the heart or the senses.
\par This attitude is founded on the perception of unity. For it has already
been said that all souls are one possessing Self, the Lord; and although the
Lord inhabits each object as if separately, yet all objects exist in that Self and
not outside it.
\par Therefore by transcending Ego and realising the one Self, we possess
the whole universe in the one cosmic consciousness and do not need to
possess physically.
\par Having by oneness with the Lord the possibility of an infinite free delight
in all things, we do not need to desire.
Page 31

\par Being one with all beings, we possess, in their enjoyment, in ours and in
the cosmic Being's, delight of universal self-expression. It is only by this
Ananda at once transcendent and universal that man can be free in his soul
and yet live in the world with the full active Life of the Lord in His universe
of movement.
\par
\ht The Justification of Works
\par This freedom does not depend upon inaction, nor is this possession
limited to the enjoyment of the inactive Soul that only witnesses without
taking part in the movement.
\par On the contrary, the doing of works in this material world and a full
acceptance of the term of physical life are part of its completeness.
\par For the active Brahman fulfils Itself in the world by works and man also
is in the body for self-fulfilment by action. He cannot do otherwise, for even
his inertia acts and produces effects in the cosmic movement. Being in this
body or any kind of body, it is idle to think of refraining from action or
escaping the physical life. The idea that this in itself can be a means of
liberation, is part of the Ignorance which supposes the soul to be a separate
entity in the Brahman.
\par Action is shunned because it is thought to be inconsistent with freedom.
The man when he acts, is supposed to be necessarily entangled in the desire
behind the action, in subjection to the formal energy that drives the action and
in the results of the action. These things are true in appearance, not in reality.
\par Desire is only a mode of the emotional mind which by ignorance seeks
its delight in the object of desire and not in the Brahman who expresses
Himself in the object. By destroying that ignorance one can do action without
entanglement in desire.
\par The Energy that drives is itself subject to the Lord, who expresses
Himself in it with perfect freedom. By getting behind Nature to the Lord of
Nature, merging the individual in the Cosmic Will, one can act with the divine
freedom. Our actions are given up to the Lord and our personal responsibility
ceases in His liberty.
Page 32

\par The chain of Karma only binds the movement of Nature and not the soul
which, by knowing itself, ceases even to appear to be bound by the result of
its works.
\par Therefore the way of freedom is not inaction, but to cease from
identifying oneself with the movement and recover instead our true identity in
the Self of things who is their Lord.
\par
\ht The Other Worlds
\par By departing from the physical life one does not disappear out of the
Movement, but only passes into some other general state of consciousness
than the material universe.
\par These states are either obscure or illuminated, some dark or sunless.
\par By persisting in gross forms of ignorance, by coercing perversely the
soul in its self-fulfilment or by a wrong dissolution of its becoming in the
Movement, one enters into states of blind darkness, not into the worlds of
light and of liberated and blissful being.

for It progresses ever in front. That, standing, passes beyond others as they
run. In That the Master of Life establishes the Waters. \nl\fnquad   5. That

\par\bl
\ht Brahman—The Unity
\par The Lord and the world, even when they seem to be distinct, are not
really different from each other; they are one Brahman.
\par
\ht “One Unmoving”
\par God is the one stable and eternal Reality. He is One because there is
nothing else, since all existence and non-existence are He. He is stable or
unmoving, because motion implies change in Space and change in Time, and
He, being beyond Time and Space, is immutable. He possesses eternally in
Himself all that is, has been or ever can be, and He therefore does not
increase or diminish. He is beyond causality and relativity and therefore there
is no change of relations in His being.
\par
\ht “Swifter Than Mind”
\par The world is a cyclic movement (\s{sa\.ms\=ara}) of the Divine
Consciousness in Space and Time. Its law and, in a sense, its object is
progression; it exists by movement and would be dissolved by cessation of
movement. But the basis of this movement is not material; it is the energy of
active consciousness which, by its motion and multiplication in different
principles (different in appearance, the same in essence), creates oppositions
of unity and multiplicity, divisions of Time and Space, relations and groupings
of circumstance and Causality. All these things are real in consciousness, but
only symbolic of the Being, somewhat as the imaginations of a creative Mind
are true representations
Page 34

of itself, yet not quite real in comparison with itself, or real with a different
kind of reality.
\par But mental consciousness is not the Power that creates the universe.
That is something infinitely more puissant, swift and unfettered than the mind.
It is the pure omnipotent self-awareness of the Absolute unbound by any law
of the relativity. The laws of the relativity, upheld by the gods, are Its
temporary creations. Their apparent eternity is only the duration,
immeasurable to us, of the world which they govern. They are laws
regularising motion and change, not laws binding the Lord of the movement.
The gods, therefore, are described as continually running in their course. But
the Lord is free and unaffected by His own movement.
\par
\ht “That Moves, That Moves Not”
\par The motion of the world works under the government of a perpetual
stability. Change represents the constant shifting of apparent relations in an
eternal Immutability.
\par It is these truths that are expressed in the formulae of the one Unmoving
that is swifter than Mind, That which moves and moves not, the one Stable
which outstrips in the speed of its effective consciousness the others who
run.
\par
\ht {Transitional Thought: {The Many}}
\note{The series of ideas under this heading seem to me to be the
indispensable metaphysical basis of the Upanishad. The Isha Upanishad does
not teach a pure and exclusive Monism; it declares the One without denying
the Many and its method is to see the One in the Many. It asserts the
simultaneous validity of Vidya and Avidya and upholds as the object of action
and knowledge an immortality consistent with Life and Birth in this world. It
regards every object as itself, the universe and every soul as itself, the divine
Purusha. The ensemble of these ideas is consistent only with a synthetic or
comprehensive as opposed to an illusionist or exclusive Monism.}
\par If the One is pre-eminently real, “the others”, the Many are not unreal.
The world is not a figment of the Mind.
\par Unity is the eternal truth of things, diversity a play of the unity. The
sense of unity has therefore been termed Knowledge, Vidya, the sense of
diversity Ignorance, Avidya. But diversity is not false except when it is
divorced from the sense of its true and eternal unity.
Page 35

\par Brahman is one, not numerically, but in essence. Numerical oneness
would either exclude multiplicity or would be a pluralistic and divisible
oneness with the Many as its parts. That is not the unity of Brahman, which
can neither be diminished nor increased, nor divided.
\par The Many in the universe are sometimes called parts of the universal
Brahman as the waves are parts of the sea. But, in truth, these waves are
each of them that sea, their diversities being those of frontal or superficial
appearances caused by the sea's motion. As each object in the universe is
really the whole universe in a different frontal appearance, so each individual
soul is all Brahman regarding Itself and world from a center of cosmic
consciousness.
\par For That is identical, not single. It is identical always and everywhere in
Time and Space, as well as identical beyond Time and Space. Numerical
oneness and multiplicity are equally valid terms of its essential unity.
\par These two terms, as we see them, are like all others, representations in
Chit, in the free and all-creative self-awareness of the Absolute regarding
itself variously, infinitely, innumerably and formulating what it regards. Chit is
a power not only of knowledge, but of expressive will, not only of receptive
vision, but of formative representation; the two are indeed one power. For
Chit is an action of Being, not of the Void. What it sees, that becomes. It
sees itself beyond Space and Time; that becomes in the conditions of Space
and Time.
\par Creation is not a making of something out of nothing or of one thing out
of another, but a self-projection of Brahman into the conditions of Space and
Time. Creation is not a making, but a becoming in terms and forms of
conscious existence.
\par In the becoming each individual is Brahman variously represented and
entering into various relations with Itself in the play of the divine
consciousness; in being, each individual is all Brahman.
\par Brahman as the Absolute or the Universal has the power of standing
back from Itself in the relativity. It conceives, by a subordinate movement of
consciousness, the individual as other than the universal, the relative as
different from the Absolute.
Page 36

Without this separative movement, the individual would always tend to lose
itself in the universal, the relative to disappear into the Absolute. Thus, It
supports a corresponding reaction in the individual who regards himself as
“other” than the transcendent and universal Brahman and “other” than the
rest of the Many. He puts identity behind him and enforces the play of Being
in the separate Ego.
\par The individual may regard himself as eternally different from the One, or
as eternally one with It, yet different, or he may go back entirely in his
consciousness to the pure Identity.
\note{The positions, in inverse order, of the three principal philosophical
schools of Vedanta, Monism, Qualified Monism and Dualism.} But he can
never regard himself as independent of some kind of Unity, for such a view
would correspond to no conceivable truth in the universe or beyond it.
\par These three attitudes correspond to three truths of the \NH Brahman
which are simultaneously valid and none of them entirely true without the
others as its complements. Their co-existence, difficult of conception to the
logical intellect, can be experienced by identity in consciousness with
Brahman.
\par Even in asserting Oneness, we must remember that Brahman is beyond
our mental distinctions and is a fact not of Thought that discriminates, but of
Being which is absolute, infinite and escapes discrimination. Our
consciousness is representative and symbolic; it cannot conceive the
thing-in-itself, the Absolute, except by negation, in a sort of void, by emptying
it of all that it seems in the universe to contain. But the Absolute is not a void
or negation. It is all that is here in Time and beyond Time.
\par Even oneness is a representation and exists in relation to multiplicity.
Vidya and Avidya are equally eternal powers of the supreme Chit. Neither
Vidya nor Avidya by itself is the absolute knowledge. ({\it See verses 9–11})
\par Still, of all relations oneness is the secret base, not multiplicity. Oneness
constitutes and upholds the multiplicity, multiplicity does not constitute and
uphold the oneness.
\par Therefore we have to conceive of oneness as our self and the essential
nature of Being, multiplicity as a representation of Self and a becoming. We
have to conceive of the Brahman as One
Page 37

Self of all and then return upon the Many as becomings of the One Being
(\sforced{bh\=ut\=ani\dots \=atm\=anam}). But both the Self and the becomings are
Brahman; we cannot regard the one as Brahman and the others as unreal
and not Brahman. Both are real, the one with a constituent and
comprehensive, the others with a derivative or dependent reality.
\par
\ht The Running of the Gods
\par Brahman representing Itself in the universe as the Stable, by Its
immutable existence (Sat), is Purusha, God, Spirit; representing Itself as the
Motional, by Its power of active Consciousness (Chit), is Nature, Force or
World-Principle (Prakriti, Shakti, Maya).
\note{Prakriti, executive Nature as opposed to Purusha, which is the Soul
governing, taking cognisance of and enjoying the works of Prakriti. Shakti,
the self-existent, self-cognitive, self-effective Power of the Lord (Ishwara,
Deva or Purusha), which expresses itself in the workings of Prakriti. Maya,
signifying originally in the Veda comprehensive and creative knowledge,
Wisdom that is from of old; afterwards taken in its second and derivative
sense, cunning, magic, Illusion. In this second significance it can really be
appropriate only to the workings of the lower Nature, \s{apar\=a prak\,rti},
which has put behind it the Divine Wisdom and is absorbed in the
experiences of the separative Ego. It is in the more ancient sense that the
word Maya is used in the Upanishads, where, indeed, it occurs but rarely.}
The play of these two principles is the Life of the universe.
\par The Gods are Brahman representing Itself in cosmic Personalities
expressive of the one Godhead who, in their impersonal action, appear as the
various play of the principles of Nature.
\par The “others” are \s{sarv\=a\,ni bh\=ut\=ani} of a later verse, all becomings,
Brahman representing itself in the separative consciousness of the Many.
\par Everything in the universe, even the Gods, seems to itself to be moving in
the general movement towards a goal outside itself or other than its
immediate idea of itself. Brahman is the goal; for It is both the beginning and
the end, the cause and the result of all movement.
\par But the idea of a final goal in the movement of Nature itself is illusory.
For Brahman is Absolute and Infinite. The Gods, labouring to reach him, find,
at every goal that they realise, Brahman still moving forward in front to a
farther realisation. Nothing in the appearances of the universe can be entirely
That to the relative consciousness; all is only a symbolic
Page 38

representation of the Unknowable.
\par All things are already realised in Brahman. The running of the Others in
the course of Nature is only a working out (Prakriti), by Causality, in Time
and Space, of something that Brahman already possesses.
\par Even in Its universal being Brahman exceeds the Movement. Exceeding
Time, It contains in Itself past, present and future simultaneously and has not
to run to the end of conceivable Time. Exceeding Space, It contains all
formations in Itself coincidently and has not to run to the end of conceivable
Space. Exceeding Causality, It contains freely in Itself all eventualities as
well as all potentialities without being bound by the apparent chain of
causality by which they are linked in the universe. Everything is already
realised by It as the Lord before it can be accomplished by the separated
Personalities in the movement.
\par
\ht The Principle of Life: {Matarishwan and the Waters}
\par What then is Its intention in the movement?
\par The movement is a rhythm, a harmony which That, as the Universal
Life, works out by figures of Itself in the terms of conscious Being. It is a
formula symbolically expressive of the Unknowable,—so arranged that every
level of consciousness really represents something beyond itself, depth of
depth, continent of continent. It is a play
\note{This is the Vaishnava image of the Lila applied usually to the play of
the Personal Deity in the world, but equally applicable to the active
impersonal Brahman.} of the divine Consciousness existing for its own
satisfaction and adding nothing to That, which is already complete. It is a fact
of conscious being, justified by its own existence, with no purpose ulterior to
itself. The idea of purpose, of a goal is born of the progressive self-unfolding
by the world of its own true nature to the individual Souls inhabiting its forms;
for the Being is gradually self-revealed within its own becomings, real Unity
emerges out of the Multiplicity and changes entirely the values of the latter to
our consciousness.
\par This self-unfolding is governed by conditions determined by the
complexity of consciousness in its cosmic action.
\par For consciousness is not simple or homogeneous, it is
Page 39

septuple. That is to say, it constitutes itself into seven forms or grades of
conscious activity descending from pure Being to physical being. Their
interplay creates the worlds, determines all activities, constitutes all
becomings.
\par Brahman is always the continent of this play or this working. Brahman
self-extended in Space and Time is the universe.
\par In this extension Brahman represents Itself as formative Nature, the
universal Mother of things, who appears to us, first, as Matter, called
\s{p\,rthiv\=i}, the Earth-Principle.
\par Brahman in Matter or physical being represents Itself as the universal
Life-Power, Matarishwan, which moves there as a dynamic energy,
\s{pr\=a\,na}, and presides effectively over all arrangement and formation.
\par Universal Life establishes, involved in Matter, the septuple
consciousness; and the action of \s{pr\=a\,na}, the dynamic energy, on the
Matrix of things evolves out of it its different forms and serves as a basis for
all their evolutions.
\par\bl
\ht Transitional Thought: {The Waters}
\par There are, then, seven constituents of Chit active in the universe.
\par We are habitually aware of three elements in our being, Mind, Life and
Body. These constitute for us a divided and mutable existence which is in a
condition of unstable harmony and works by a strife of positive and negative
forces between the two poles of Birth and Death. For all life is a constant
birth or becoming (\s{sambhava}, \s{sambh\=uti} of {\it Verses 12–14}). All
birth entails a constant death or dissolution of that which becomes, in order
that it may change into a new becoming. Therefore this state of existence is
called \s{m\,rtyu}, Death, and described as a stage which has to be passed
through and transcended. ({\it Verses 11, 14})
\par For this is not the whole of our being and, therefore, not our pure being.
We have, behind, a superconscious existence which has also three
constituents, \s{sat}, \s{cit-tapas} and \s{\=ananda}.
\par Sat is essence of our being, pure infinite and undivided, as opposed to
this divisible being which founds itself on the constant changeableness of
physical substance. Sat is the divine
Page 40

counterpart of physical substance.
\par Chit-Tapas is pure energy of Consciousness, free in its rest or its action,
sovereign in its will, as opposed to the hampered dynamic energies of Prana
which, feeding upon physical substances, are dependent on and limited by
their sustenance.
\note{Therefore physical substance is called in the Upanishads \s{annam},
Food. In its origin, however, the word meant simply being or substance.}
Tapas is the divine counterpart of this lower nervous or vital energy.
\par Ananda is Beatitude, the bliss of pure conscious existence and energy,
as opposed to the life of the sensations and emotions which are at the mercy
of the outward touches of Life and Matter and their positive and negative
reactions, joy and grief, pleasure and pain. Ananda is the divine counterpart
of the lower emotional and sensational being.
\par This higher existence, proper to the divine Sachchidananda, is unified,
self-existent, not confused by the figures of Birth and Death. It is called,
therefore, \s{am\,rtam}, Immortality, and offered to us as the goal to be aimed
at and the felicity to be enjoyed when we have transcended the state of
death. ({\it Verses 11, 14, 17, 18})
\par The higher divine is linked to the lower mortal existence by the causal
Idea
\note{Not the abstract mental idea, but the supramental Real-Idea, the
Consciousness, Force and Delight of the Being precipitated into a
comprehensive and discriminative awareness of all the truths and powers of
its own existence, carrying in its self-knowledge the will of self-manifestation,
the power of all its potentialities and the power of all its forms. It is power
that acts and effectuates, as well as knowledge master of its own action.} or
supra-mental Knowledge-Will, \s{vij\~n\=ana}. It is the causal Idea which, by
supporting and secretly guiding the confused activities of the Mind, Life and
Body, ensures and compels the right arrangement of the universe. It is called
in the Veda the Truth because it represents by direct vision the truth of things
both inclusive and independent of their appearances; the Right or Law,
because, containing in itself the effective power of Chit, it works out all things
according to their nature with a perfect knowledge and prevision; the Vast,
because it is of the nature of an infinite cosmic Intelligence comprehensive of
all particular activities.
\par Vijnana, as the Truth, leads the divided consciousness back to the One.
It also sees the truth of things in the multiplicity.
Page 41

Vijnana is the divine counterpart of the lower divided intelligence.
\par These seven powers of Chit are spoken of by the Vedic Rishis as the
Waters, they are imaged as currents flowing into or rising out of the general
sea of Consciousness in the human being.
\note{\s{H\,rdya samudra}, Ocean of the Heart. Rv. IV. 58. 5.}
\par They are all co-existent in the universe eternally and inseparably, but
capable of being involved and remanifested in each other. They are actually
involved in physical Nature and must necessarily evolve out of it. They can
be withdrawn into pure infinite Being and can again be manifested out of it.
\par The infolding and unfolding of the One in the Many and the Many in the
One is therefore the law of the eternally recurrent cosmic Cycles.
\par
\ht The Vision of the Brahman
\par The Upanishad teaches us how to perceive Brahman in the universe and
in our self-existence.
\par We have to perceive Brahman comprehensively as both the Stable and
the Moving. We must see It in eternal and immutable Spirit and in all the
changing manifestations of universe and relativity.
\par We have to perceive all things in Space and Time, the far and the near,
the immemorial Past, the immediate Present, the infinite Future with all their
contents and happenings as the One Brahman.
\par We have to perceive Brahman as that which exceeds, contains and
supports all individual things as well as all universe, transcendentally of Time
and Space and Causality. We have to perceive It also as that which lives in
and possesses the universe and all it contains.
\par This is the transcendental, universal and individual Brahman, Lord,
Continent and Indwelling Spirit, which is the object of all knowledge. Its
realisation is the condition of perfection and the way of Immortality.

\ht Self-Realisation
\sect3
\par
\ht Verses 6–7
\note{6. But he who sees everywhere the Self in all existences and all
existences in the Self, shrinks not thereafter from aught. \nl\fnquad   7. He in
whom it is the Self-Being that has become all existences that are Becomings,
for he has the perfect knowledge, how shall he be deluded, whence shall he
have grief who sees everywhere oneness?}
\par\bl
\ht Self-Realisation
\par Brahman is, subjectively, Atman, the Self or immutable existence of all
that is in the universe. Everything that changes in us, mind, life, body,
character, temperament, action, is not our real and unchanging self, but
becomings of the Self in the movement, \s{jagat\=i}.
\par In Nature, therefore, all things that exist, animate or inanimate, are
becomings of the one Self of all. All these different creatures are one
indivisible existence. This is the truth each being has to realise.
\par When this unity has been realised by the individual in every part of his
being, he becomes perfect, pure, liberated from ego and the dualities,
possessed of the entire divine felicity.
\par
\ht Atman
\par Atman, our true self, is Brahman; it is pure indivisible Being,
self-luminous, self-concentrated in consciousness, self-concentrated in force,
self-delighted. Its existence is light and bliss. It is timeless, spaceless and
free.
\par
\ht {The Threefold Purusha}
\note{Gita XV. 16, 17. See also XIII \s{passim}.}
\par Atman represents itself to the consciousness of the creature in three
states, dependent on the relations between \s{puru\,sa} and \s{prak\,rti}, the
Soul and Nature. These three states are \s{ak\,sara}, unmoving or immutable;
\s{k\,sara}, moving or mutable; and \s{para} or \s{uttama}, Supreme or
Highest.
Page 43

\par Kshara Purusha is the Self reflecting the changes and movements of
Nature, participating in them, immersed in the consciousness of the
movement and seeming in it to be born and die, increase and diminish,
progress and change. Atman, as the Kshara, enjoys change and division and
duality; controls secretly its own changes but seems to be controlled by them;
enjoys the oppositions of pleasure and pain, good and bad, but appears to be
their victim; possesses and upholds the action of Nature, by which it seems to
be created. For, always and inalienably, the Self is Ishwara, the Lord.
\par Akshara Purusha is the Self, standing back from the changes and
movements of Nature, calm, pure, impartial, indifferent, watching them and
not participating, above them as on a summit, not immersed in these Waters.
This calm Self is the sky that never moves and changes looking down upon
the waters that are never at rest. The Akshara is the hidden freedom of the
Kshara.
\par Para Purusha or Purushottama is the Self containing and enjoying both
the stillness and the movement, but conditioned and limited by neither of
them. It is the Lord, Brahman, the All, the Indefinable and Unknowable.
\par It is this supreme Self that has to be realised in both the unmoving and
the mutable.
\par
\ht {Purusha in Prakriti}
\note{\s{Taittiriya Upanishad} II. 1–6.}
\par Atman, the Self, represents itself differently in the sevenfold movement
of Nature according to the dominant principle of the consciousness in the
individual being.
\par In the physical consciousness Atman becomes the material being,
\s{annamaya puru\,sa}.
\par In the vital or nervous consciousness Atman becomes the vital or
dynamic being, \s{pr\=a\,namaya puru\,sa}.
\par In the mental consciousness Atman becomes the mental being,
\s{manomaya puru\,sa}.
\par In the supra-intellectual consciousness, dominated by the Truth or causal
Idea (called in Veda \s{satyam \,rtam b\,rhat}, the True, the Right, the Vast),
Atman becomes the ideal being or
Page 44

great Soul, \s{vij\~n\=anamaya puru\,sa} or \s{mahat \=atman}.
\note{The \s{mahat \=atman} or Vast Self is frequently referred to in the
Upanishads. It is also called \s{bh\=um\=a}, the Large.}
\par In the consciousness proper to the universal Beatitude, Atman becomes
the all-blissful being or all-enjoying and all-productive Soul, \s{\=anandamaya
puru\,sa}.
\par In the consciousness proper to the infinite divine self-awareness which is
also the infinite all-effective Will (\s{cit-tapas}), Atman is the all-conscious
Soul that is source and lord of the universe, \s{caitanya puru\,sa}.
\par In the consciousness proper to the state of pure divine existence, Atman
is \s{sat puru\,sa}, the pure divine Self.
\par Man, being one in his true Self with the Lord who inhabits all forms, can
live in any of these states of the Self in the world and partake of its
experiences. He can be anything he wills from the material to the all-blissful
being. Through the Anandamaya he can enter into the Chaitanya and Sat
Purusha.
\par
\ht Sachchidananda
\par Sachchidananda is the manifestation of the higher Purusha; its nature of
infinite being, consciousness, power and bliss is the higher Nature, \s{par\=a
prak\,rti}. Mind, life and body are the lower nature, \s{apar\=a prak\,rti}.
\par The state of Sachchidananda is the higher half of universal existence,
\s{par\=ardha}, the nature of which is Immortality, \s{am\,rtam}. The state of
mortal existence in Matter is the lower half, \s{apar\=ardha}, the nature of
which is death, \s{m\,rtyu}.
\par Mind and life in the body are in the state of Death because by Ignorance
they fail to realise Sachchidananda. Realising perfectly Sachchidananda, they
can convert themselves, Mind into the nature of the Truth, \s{vij\~n\=ana}, Life
into the nature of \s{caitanya}, Body into the nature of \s{sat}, that is, into
the pure essence.
\par When this cannot be done perfectly in the body, the soul realises its true
state in other forms of existence or worlds, the “sunlit” worlds and states of
felicity, and returns upon material existence to complete its evolution in the
body.
\par A progressively perfect realisation in the body is the aim of human
evolution.
Page 45

\par It is also possible for the soul to withdraw for an indefinable period into
the pure state of Sachchidananda.
\par The realisation of the Self as Sachchidananda is the aim of human
existence.
\par
\ht The Condition of Self-Realisation
\note{I have collected under this and the preceding headings the principal
ideas of the Upanishads with regard to the Self, although not expressly
mentioned or alluded to in our text, because they are indispensable to an
understanding of the complete philosophy of these Scriptures and to the
relations of the thought which is developed in the Isha.}
\par Sachchidananda is always the pure state of Atman; it may either remain
self-contained as if apart from the universe or overlook, embrace and possess
it as the Lord.
\par In fact, it does both simultaneously. ({\it Verse 8})
\par The Lord pervades the universe as the Virat Purusha, the Cosmic Soul
(\s{paribh\=u\,h} of the eighth verse, the One who becomes everywhere); He
enters into each object in the movement, to the Knowledge as Brahman
supporting individual consciousness and individual form, to the Ignorance as
an individualised and limited being. He manifests as the Jivatman or individual
self in the living creature.
\par From the standpoint of our lower state in the kingdom of death and
limitation Atman is Sachchidananda, supra-mental, but reflected in the mind.
If the mind is pure, bright and still, there is the right reflection; if it is
unpurified, troubled and obscured, the reflection is distorted and subjected to
the crooked action of the Ignorance.
\par According to the state of the reflecting mind we may have either purity
of self-knowledge or an obscuration and distortion of knowledge in the
dualities of truth and error; a pure activity of unegoistic Will or an obscuration
and deflection of Will in the dualities of right and wrong action, sin and virtue;
a pure state and unmixed play of beatitude or an obscuration and perversion
of it in the dualities of right and wrong enjoyment, pleasure and pain, joy and
grief.
\par It is the mental ego-sense that creates this distortion by division and
limitation of the Self. The limitation is brought about through the Kshara
Purusha identifying itself with the changeable
Page 46

formations of Nature in the separate body, the individual life and the egoistic
mind, to the exclusion of the sense of unity with all existence and with all
existences.
\par This exclusion is a fixed habit of the understanding due to our past
evolution in the movement, not an ineffugable law of human consciousness.
Its diminution and final disappearance are the condition of self-realisation.
\par The beginning of wisdom, perfection and beatitude is the vision of the
One.
\par\bl
\ht The Stages of Self-Realisation: The Vision of the All
\par The first movement of self-realisation is the sense of unity with other
existences in the universe. Its early or crude form is the attempt to
understand or sympathise with others, the tendency of a widening love or
compassion or fellow-feeling for others, the impulsion of work for the sake of
others.
\par The oneness so realised is a pluralistic unity, the drawing together of
similar units resulting in a collectivity or solidarity rather than in real oneness.
The Many remain to the \NH consciousness as the real existences; the One
is only their result.
\par Real knowledge begins with the perception of essential oneness,—one
Matter, one Life, one Mind, one Soul playing in many forms.
\par When this Soul of things is seen to be Sachchidananda, then knowledge
is perfected. For we see Matter to be only a play of Life, Life a play of Mind
energising itself in substance, Mind a play of Truth or causal Idea
representing truth of being variously in all possible mental forms, Truth a play
of Sachchidananda, Sachchidananda the self-manifestation of a supreme
Unknowable, Para-Brahman or Para-Purusha.
\par We perceive the soul in all bodies to be this one Self or Sachchidananda
multiplying itself in individual consciousness. We see also all minds, lives,
bodies to be active formations of the same existence in the extended being of
the Self.
\par This is the vision of all existences in the Self and of the Self in all
existences which is the foundation of perfect internal liberty and perfect joy
and peace.
Page 47

\par For by this vision, in proportion as it increases in intensity and
completeness, there disappears from the individual mentality all \s{jugups\=a},
that is to say, all repulsion, shrinking, dislike, fear, hatred and other
perversions of feeling which arise from division and personal opposition to
other beings or to the objectivities that surround us. Perfect
equality
\note{The state described in the Gita is \s{samatva}. \s{Jugups\=a} is the
feeling of repulsion caused by the sense of a want of harmony between one's
own limited self-formation and the contacts of the external with a consequent
recoil of grief, fear, hatred, discomfort, suffering. It is the opposite of
attraction which is the source of desire and attachment. Repulsion and
attraction removed, we have \s{samatva}.} of soul is established.
\par
\ht The Vision of the Self in its Becomings
\par Vision is not sufficient; one must become what inwardly one sees. The
whole inner life must be changed so as to represent perfectly in all parts of
the being what is understood by the intellect and seen by the inner perception.
\par In the individual soul extending itself to the All by the vision of unity
(\s{ekatvam anupa\'syata\,h}, seeing everywhere oneness) arranging its
thoughts, emotions and sensations according to the perfect knowledge of the
right relation of things which comes by the realisation of the Truth
(\s{vij\=anata\,h}, having the perfect knowledge), there must be repeated the
divine act of consciousness by which the one Being, eternally self-existent,
manifests in itself the multiplicity of the world (\s{sarv\=a\,ni bh\=ut\=ani \=atmaiva
abh\=ut}, the Self-Being became all Becomings).
\par That is to say, the human or egoistic view is that of a world of
innumerable separate creatures each self-existent and different from the
others, each trying to get its utmost possible profit out of the others and the
world, but the divine view, the way in which God sees the world, is Himself,
as the sole Being, living in innumerable existences that are Himself,
supporting all, helping all impartially, working out to a divine fulfilment and
under terms fixed from the beginning, from years sempiternal, a great
progressive harmony of Becoming whose last term is Sachchidananda or
Immortality. This is the viewpoint of the Self as Lord inhabiting the whole
movement. The individual soul has to change the human or egoistic for the
divine, supreme and universal view and live in that realisation.
Page 48

\par It is necessary, therefore, to have the knowledge of the transcendent
Self, the sole unity, in the equation \s{so'ham}, I am He, and in that
knowledge to extend one's conscious existence so as to embrace the whole
Multiplicity.
\par This is the double or synthetic ideal of the Isha Upanishad; to embrace
simultaneously Vidya and Avidya, the One and the Many; to exist in the
world, but change the terms of the Death into the terms of the Immortality; to
have the freedom and peace of the Non-Birth simultaneously with the activity
of the Birth. ({\it Verses 9–14})
\par All parts of the lower being must consent to this realisation; to perceive
with the intellect is not enough. The heart must consent in a universal love
and delight, the sense-mind in a sensation of God and self everywhere, the
life in the comprehension of all aims and energies in the world as part of its
own being.
\par
\ht The Active Beatitude
\par This realisation is the perfect and complete Beatitude, embracing action,
but delivered from sorrow and self-delusion.
\par There is no possibility of self-delusion (\s{moha}); for the soul, having
attained to the perception of the Unknowable behind all existence, is no
longer attached to the Becoming and no longer attributes an absolute value to
any particularity in the universe, as if that were an object in itself and
desirable in itself. All is enjoyable and has a value as the manifestation of the
Self and for the sake of the Self which is manifested in it, but none for its
own.
\note{\s{Brihadaranyaka Upanishad}.} Desire and illusion are removed;
illusion is replaced by knowledge, desire by the active beatitude of universal
possession.
\par There is no possibility of sorrow; for all is seen as Sachchidananda and
therefore in the terms of the infinite conscious existence, the infinite will, the
infinite felicity. Even pain and grief are seen to be perverse terms of Ananda,
and that Ananda which they veil here and for which they prepare the lower
existence (for all suffering in the evolution is a preparation of strength and
bliss) is already seized, known and enjoyed by the soul thus liberated and
perfected. For it possesses the eternal Reality of which they are the
appearances.
Page 49

\par Thus it is possible, by the realisation of the unity of God and the world
({\it i\'s} and \s{jagat}) in the complete knowledge of the Brahman, to
renounce desire and illusion through the ascent to the pure Self and the
Non-Becoming and yet to enjoy by means of all things in the manifestation
God in the universe through a free and illuminated self-identification with
Sachchidananda in all existences.
\par
\ht Conclusion
\par We have, therefore, in the second movement the explanation of the first
verse of the Upanishad. The first line, asserting that all souls are the one
Lord inhabiting every object in the universe and that every object is universe
in universe, movement in the general movement, has been explained in the
terms of complete oneness by the Brahman, transcendental and universal
even in the individual, One in the Many, Many in the One, Stable and
Motional, exceeding and reconciling all opposites. The second line, fixing as
the rule of divine life universal renunciation of desire as the condition of
universal enjoyment in the spirit, has been explained by the state of
self-realisation, the realisation of the free and transcendent Self as one's own
true being, of that Self as Sachchidananda and of the universe seen as the
Becoming of Sachchidananda and possessed in the terms of the right
Knowledge and no longer in the terms of the Ignorance which is the cause of
all attraction and repulsion, self-delusion and sorrow.

\ht Verse 8
\note{8. It is He that has gone abroad—That which is bright, bodiless,
without scar of imperfection, without sinews, pure, unpierced by evil. The
Seer, the Thinker, the One who becomes everywhere, the Self-existent has
ordered objects perfectly according to their nature from years sempiternal.}
\par\bl
\ht “He”
\par In its third movement the Upanishad takes up the justification of works
already stated in general terms in its second verse and founds it more
precisely upon the conception of Brahman or the Self as the Lord,—\s{\=i\'s},
\s{\=i\'svara}, \s{para puru\,sa}, \s{sa\,h} (He)—who is the cause of personality
and governs by His law of works the rhythm of the Movement and the
process of the worlds that He conceives and realises throughout eternal Time
in His own self-existence.
\par It is an error to conceive that the Upanishads teach the true existence
only of an impersonal and actionless Brahman, an impersonal God without
power or qualities. They declare rather an Unknowable that manifests itself
to us in a double aspect of Personality and Impersonality. When they wish to
speak of this Unknowable in the most comprehensive and general way, they
use the neuter and call it \s{tat}, That; but this neuter does not exclude the
aspect of universal and transcendent Personality acting and governing the
world (cf. \s{Kena Upanishad} III). Still, when they intend to make
prominent the latter idea they more often prefer to use the masculine \s{sa\,h},
He, or else they employ the term Deva, God or the Divine, or Purusha, the
conscious Soul, of whom Prakriti or Maya is the executive Puissance, the
Shakti.
\par The Isha Upanishad, having declared the Brahman as the sole reality
manifesting itself in many aspects and forms, having presented this Brahman
subjectively as the Self, the one Being of whom all existences are
Becomings, and as that which we have to realise in ourselves and in all things
and beyond all things, now
Page 51

proceeds to assert the same Brahman more objectively as the Lord, the
Purusha who both contains and inhabits the universe.
\par It is He that went abroad. This Brahman, this Self is identical with the
Lord, the Ish, with whose name the Upanishad opens, the Inhabitant of all
forms: and, as we shall find, identical with the universal Purusha of the 16th
verse,—“The Purusha there and there, He am I.” It is He who has become
all things and beings,—a conscious Being, the sole Existent and Self-existent,
who is Master and Enjoyer of all He becomes. And the Upanishad proceeds
to formulate the nature and manner, the general law of that becoming of God
which we call the world. For on this conception depends the Vedic idea of
the two poles of death and immortality, the reason for the existence of
Avidya, the Ignorance, and the justification of works in the world.
\par\bl
\ht Transitional Thought: {The Divine Personality}
\par The Vedantic idea of God, “He”, Deva or Ishwara, must not be
confused with the ordinary notions attached to the conception of a Personal
God. Personality is generally conceived as identical with individuality and the
vulgar idea of a Personal God is a magnified individual like man in His nature
but yet different, greater, more vast and all-overpowering. Vedanta admits
the human manifestation of Brahman in man and to man, but does not admit
that this is the real nature of the Ishwara.
\par God is Sachchidananda. He manifests Himself as infinite existence of
which the essentiality is consciousness, of which again the essentiality is bliss,
is self-delight. Delight cognising variety of itself, seeking its own variety, as it
were, becomes the universe. But these are abstract terms; abstract ideas in
themselves cannot produce concrete realities. They are impersonal states;
impersonal states cannot in themselves produce personal activities.
\par This becomes still clearer if we consider the manifestation of
Sachchidananda. In that manifestation Delight translates itself into Love;
Consciousness translates itself into double terms, conceptive Knowledge,
executive Force; Existence translates itself into Being, that is to say, into
Person and Substance. But
Page 52

Love is incomplete without a Lover and an object of Love, Knowledge
without a Knower and an object of Knowledge, Force without a Worker and
a Work, Substance without a Person cognising and constituting it.
\par This is because the original terms also are not really impersonal
abstractions. In delight of Brahman there is an Enjoyer of delight, in
consciousness of Brahman a Conscient, in existence of Brahman an Existent;
but the object of Brahman's delight and consciousness and the term and stuff
of Its existence are Itself. In the divine Being Knowledge, the Knower and
the Known and, therefore, necessarily also Delight, the Enjoyer and the
Enjoyed are one.
\par This Self-Awareness and Self-Delight of Brahman has two modes of its
Force of consciousness, its Prakriti or Maya,—intensive in self-absorption,
diffusive in self-extension. The intensive mode is proper to the pure and silent
Brahman; the diffusive to the active Brahman. It is the diffusion of the
Self-existent in the term and stuff of His own existence that we call the
world, the becoming or the perpetual movement (\s{bhuvanam}, \s{jagat}). It
is Brahman that becomes; what He becomes is also the Brahman. The object
of Love is the self of the Lover; the work is the self-figuration of the Worker;
Universe is body and action of the Lord.
\par When, therefore, we consider the abstract and impersonal aspect of the
infinite existence, we say, “That”; when we consider the Existent self-aware
and self-blissful, we say, “He”. Neither conception is entirely complete.
Brahman itself is the Unknowable beyond all conceptions of Personality and
Impersonality. We may call it “That” to show that we exile from our
affirmation all term and definition. We may equally call it “He”, provided we
speak with the same intention of rigorous exclusion. \s{Tat} and \s{sa\,h} are
always the same, One that escapes definition.
\par In the universe there is a constant relation of Oneness and Multiplicity.
This expresses itself as the universal Personality and the many Persons, and
both between the One and the Many and among the Many themselves there
is the possibility of an infinite variety of relations. These relations are
determined by the play of the divine existence, the Lord, entering into His
Page 53

manifested habitations. They exist at first as conscious relations between
individual souls; they are then taken up by them and used as a means of
entering into conscious relation with the One. It is this entering into various
relations with the One which is the object and function of Religion. All
religions are justified by this essential necessity; all express one Truth in
various ways and move by various paths to one goal.
\par The Divine Personality reveals Himself in various forms and names to
the individual soul. These forms and names are in a sense created in the
human consciousness; in another they are eternal symbols revealed by the
Divine who thus concretises Himself in mind-form to the multiple
consciousness and aids it in its return to its own Unity.
\note{It would be an error to suppose that these conceptions are in their
essence later developments of philosophical Hinduism. The conception of the
many forms and names of the One is as old as the Rig Veda.}
\par
\ht He That Went Abroad
\par It is He that has extended Himself in the relative consciousness whose
totality of finite and changeable circumstances dependent on an equal,
immutable and eternal Infinity is what we call the Universe. \s{Sa paryag\=at}.
\par In this extension we have, therefore, two aspects, one of pure infinite
relationless immutability, another of a totality of objects in Time and Space
working out their relations through causality. Both are different and mutually
complementary expressions of the same unknowable “He”.
\par To express the infinite Immutability the Upanishad uses a series of
neuter adjectives, “Bright, bodiless, without scar, without sinews, pure,
unpierced by evil.” To express the same Absolute as cause, continent and
governing Inhabitant of the totality of objects and of each object in the totality
(\s{jagaty\=am jagat}) it uses four masculine epithets, “The Seer, the Thinker,
the One who becomes everywhere, the Self-existent” or “the
Self-Becoming”.
\par The Immutable is the still and secret foundation of the play and the
movement, extended equally, impartially in all things, \s{samam
brahma},
\note{“The equal Brahman.”—Gita.} lending its support to all without choice
or
Page 54

active participation. Secure and free in His eternal immutability the Lord
projects Himself into the play and the movement, becoming there in His
self-existence all that the Seer in Him visualises and the Thinker in Him
conceives. \s{Kavir man\=i\,s\=i paribh\=u\,h svayambh\=u\,h}.
\par
\ht The Pure Immutable
\par The pure immutability of the Lord is “bright”. It is a luminosity of pure
concentrated Self-awareness, not broken by refractions, not breaking out into
colour and form. It is the pure self-knowledge of the Purusha, the conscious
Soul, with his Power, his executive Force contained and inactive.
\par It is “bodiless”,—without form, indivisible and without appearance of
division. It is one equal Purusha in all things, not divided by the divisions of
Space and Time,—a pure self-conscious Absolute.
\par It is without scar, that is, without defect, break or imperfection. It is
untouched and unaffected by the mutabilities. It supports their clash of
relations, their play of more and less, of increase and diminution, of irruption
and interpenetration. For Itself is without action, \s{acala\,h
san\=atana\,h},
\note{Gita II. 24.} “motionless, sempiternal.”
\par It is without sinews. The reason for Its being without scar is that It does
not put out Power, does not dispense Force in multiple channels, does not lose
it here, increase it there, replenish its loss or seek by love or by violence its
complementary or its food. It is without nerves of force; It does not pour
itself out in the energies of the Pranic dynamism, of Life, of Matarishwan.
\par It is pure, unpierced by evil. What we call sin or evil, is merely excess
and defect, wrong placement, inharmonious action and reaction. By its
equality, by its inaction even while it supports all action, the conscious Soul
retains its eternal freedom and eternal purity. For it is unmodified; It watches
as the Sakshi, the witness, the modifications effected by Prakriti, but does not
partake of them, does not get clogged with them, receives not their
impression. \s{Na lipyate}.
Page 55

\par
\ht The Soul Inalienably Free
\par What is the relation of the active Brahman and of the human soul to this
pure Inactive? They too are That. Action does not change the nature of the
Self, but only the nature of the diverse forms. The Self is always pure,
blissful, perfect, whether inactive or participating in action.
\par The Self is all things and exceeds them. It exceeds always that in which
the mind is engrossed, that which it takes in a particular time and space as a
figure of itself. The boundless whole is always perfect. The totality of things
is a complete harmony without wound or flaw. The viewpoint of the part
taken for a whole, in other words the Ignorance, is the broken reflection
which creates the consciousness of limitation, incompleteness and discord.
We shall see that this Ignorance has a use in the play of the Brahman; but in
itself it appears at first to be only a parent of evil.
\par Ignorance is a veil that separates the mind, body and life from their
source and reality, Sachchidananda. Thus obscured the mind feels itself
pierced by the evil that Ignorance creates. But the Active Brahman is always
Sachchidananda using for its self-becoming the forms of mind, body and life.
All their experiences are therefore seen by It in the terms of
Sachchidananda. It is not pierced by the evil. For It also is the One and sees
everywhere Oneness. It is not mastered by the Ignorance that It uses as a
minor term of its conception.
\par The human soul is one with the Lord; it also is in its completeness
Sachchidananda using Ignorance as the minor term of its being. But it has
projected its conceptions into this minor term and established there in limited
mind its centre of vision, its viewpoint. It assumes to itself the incompleteness
and the resultant sense of want, discord, desire, suffering. The Real Man
behind is not affected by all this confusion; but the apparent or exterior Man
is affected. To recover its freedom it must recover its completeness; it must
identify itself with the divine Inhabitant within, its true and complete self. It
can then, like the Lord, conduct the action of Prakriti without undergoing the
false impression of identification with the results of its action. It is this idea on
which the Upanishad bases the assertion, “Action cleaveth not to a man.”
Page 56

\par To this end it must recover the silent Brahman within. The Lord
possesses always His double term and conducts the action of the universe,
extended in it, but not attached to or limited by His works. The human soul,
entangled in mind, is obscured in vision by the rushing stream of Prakriti's
works and fancies itself to be a part of that stream and swept in its currents
and in its eddies. It has to go back in its self-existence to the silent Purusha
even while participating in its self-becoming in the movement of Prakriti. It
becomes, then, not only like the silent Purusha, the witness and upholder, but
also the Lord and the free enjoyer of Prakriti and her works. An absolute
calm and passivity, purity and equality within, a sovereign and inexhaustible
activity without is the nature of Brahman as we see it manifested in the
universe.
\par There is therefore no farther objection to works. On the contrary, works
are justified by the participation or self-identification of the soul with the Lord
in His double aspect of passivity and activity. Tranquillity for the Soul, activity
for the energy, is the balance of the divine rhythm in man.
\par
\ht The Law of Things
\par The totality of objects (\s{arth\=an}) is the becoming of the Lord in the
extension of His own being. Its principle is double. There is consciousness;
there is Being. Consciousness dwells in energy (\s{tapas}) upon its self-being
to produce Idea of itself (\s{vij\~n\=ana}) and form and action inevitably
corresponding to the Idea. This is the original Indian conception of creation,
self-production or projection into form (\s{s\,r\,s\,ti}, \s{prasava}). Being uses its
self-awareness to evolve infinite forms of itself governed by the expansion of
the innate Idea in the form. This is the original Indian conception of evolution,
prominent in certain philosophies such as the Sankhya (\s{pari\,n\=ama},
\s{vik\=ara}, \s{vivarta}). It is the same phenomenon diversely stated.
\par In the idea of some thinkers the world is a purely subjective evolution
(\s{vivarta}), not real as objective facts; in the idea of others it is an objective
fact, a real modification (\s{pari\,n\=ama}), but one which makes no difference
to the essence of Being. Both notions claim to derive from the Upanishads as
their authority,
Page 57

and their opposition comes in fact by the separation of what in the ancient
Vedanta was viewed as one,—as we see in this passage.
\par Brahman is His own subject and His own object, whether in His pure
self-existence or in His varied self-becoming. He is the object of His own
self-awareness; He is the Knower of His own self-being. The two aspects
are inseparable, even though they seem to disappear into each other and
emerge again from each other. All appearance of pure subjectivity holds
itself as an object implicit in its very subjectivity; all appearance of pure
objectivity holds itself as subject implicit in its very objectivity.
\par All objective existence is the Self-existent, the Self-becoming,
\s{svayambh\=u}, becoming by the force of the Idea within it. The Idea is,
self-contained, the Fact that it becomes. For \s{svayambh\=u} sees or
comprehends Himself in the essence of the Fact as \s{kavi}, thinks Himself
out in the evolution of its possibilities as \s{man\=i\,s\=i}, becomes form of Himself
in the movement in Space and Time as \s{paribh\=u}. These three are one
operation appearing as successive in the relative, temporal and spatial
Consciousness.
\par It follows that every object holds in itself the law of its own being
eternally, \s{\'s\=a\'svat\=ibhya\,h sam\=abhya\,h}, from years sempiternal, in perpetual
Time. All relations in the totality of objects are thus determined by their
Inhabitant, the Self-existent, the Self-becoming, and stand contained in the
nature of things by the omnipresence of the One, the Lord, by His self-vision
which is their inherent subjective Truth, by His self-becoming which, against
a background of boundless possibilities, is the Law of their inevitable
evolution in the objective Fact.
\par Therefore all things are arranged by Him perfectly, \s{y\=ath\=a-tathyata\,h},
as they should be in their nature. There is an imperative harmony in the All,
which governs the apparent discords of individualisation. That discord would
be real and operate in eternal chaos, if there were only a mass of individual
forms and forces, if each form and force did not contain in itself and were
not in its reality the self-existent All, the Lord.
\par
\ht The Process of Things
\par The Lord appears to us in the relative notion of the process
Page 58

of things first as Kavi, the Wise, the Seer. The Kavi sees the Truth in itself,
the truth in its becoming, in its essence, possibilities, actuality. He contains all
that in the Idea, the Vijnana, called the Truth and Law, \s{satyam \,rtam}. He
contains it comprehensively, not piecemeal; the Truth and Law of things is
the \s{b\,rhat}, the Large. Viewed by itself, the realm of Vijnana would seem
a realm of predetermination, of concentration, of compelling seed-state. But it
is a determination not in previous Time, but in perpetual Time; a Fate
compelled by the Soul, not compelling it, compelling rather the action and
result, present in the expansion of the movement as well as in the
concentration of the Idea. Therefore the truth of the Soul is freedom and
mastery, not subjection and bondage. Purusha commands Prakriti, Prakriti
does not compel Purusha. \s{Na karma lipyate nare}.
\par The Manishi takes his stand in the possibilities. He has behind him the
freedom of the Infinite and brings it in as a background for the determination
of the finite. Therefore every action in the world seems to emerge from a
balancing and clashing of various possibilities. None of these, however, are
effective in the determination except by their secret consonance with the
Law of that which has to become. The Kavi is in the Manishi and upholds
him in his working. But viewed by itself the realm of the Manishi would seem
to be a state of plasticity, of free-will, of the interaction of forces, but of a
free-will in thought which is met by a fate in things.
\par For the action of the Manishi is meant to eventuate in the becoming of
the Paribhu. The Paribhu, called also Virat, extends Himself in the realm of
eventualities. He fulfils what is contained in the Truth, what works out in the
possibilities reflected by the mind, what appears to us as the fact objectively
realised. The realm of Virat would seem, if taken separately, to be that of a
Law and Predetermination which compels all things that evolve in that
realm,—the iron chain of Karma, the rule of mechanical necessity, the
despotism of an inexplicable Law.
\par But the becoming of Virat is always the becoming of the self-existent
Lord,—\s{paribh\=u\,h svayambh\=u\,h}. Therefore to realise the truth of that
becoming we have to go back and re-embrace all that stands behind;—we
have to return to the full truth of the
Page 59

free and infinite Sachchidananda.
\par This is the truth of things as seen from above and from the Unity. It is
the divine standpoint; but we have to take account of the human standpoint
which starts from below, proceeds from the Ignorance, and perceives these
principles successively, not comprehensively, as separate states of
consciousness. Humanity is that which returns in experience to
Sachchidananda, and it must begin from below, in Avidya, with the mind
embodied in matter, the Thinker imprisoned and emerging from the objective
Fact. This imprisoned Thinker is Man, the “Manu”.
\par He has to start from death and division and arrive at unity and
immortality. He has to realise the universal in the individual and the Absolute
in the relative. He is Brahman growing self-conscious in the objective
multiplicity. He is the ego in the cosmos vindicating himself as the All and the
Transcendent.

\par\bl
\ht Vidya and Avidya
\par All manifestation proceeds by the two terms, Vidya and Avidya, the
consciousness of Unity and the consciousness of Multiplicity. They are the
two aspects of the Maya, the formative self-conception of the Eternal.
\par Unity is the eternal and fundamental fact, without which all multiplicity
would be unreal and an impossible illusion. The consciousness of Unity is
therefore called Vidya, the Knowledge.
\par Multiplicity is the play or varied self-expansion of the One, shifting in its
terms, divisible in its view of itself, by force of which the One occupies many
centres of consciousness, inhabits many formations of energy in the universal
Movement. Multiplicity is implicit or explicit in unity. Without it the Unity
would be either a void of non-existence or a powerless, sterile limitation to
the state of indiscriminate self-absorption or of blank repose.
\par But the consciousness of multiplicity separated from the true knowledge
in the many of their own essential oneness,—the viewpoint of the separate
ego identifying itself with the divided form and the limited action,—is a state
of error and delusion. In man this is the form taken by the consciousness of
multiplicity. Therefore it is given the name of Avidya, the Ignorance.
\par Brahman, the Lord, is one and all-blissful, but free from limitation by His
unity; all-powerful, He is able to conceive Himself from multiple centres in
multiple forms from which and upon
Page 61

which flow multiple currents of energy, seen by us as actions or play of
forces. When He is thus multiple, He is not bound by His multiplicity, but
amid all variations dwells eternally in His own oneness. He is Lord of Vidya
and Avidya. They are the two sides of His self-conception (Maya), the twin
powers of His Energy (Chit-Shakti).
\par Brahman, exceeding as well as dwelling in the play of His Maya, is
\s{\=i\'s}, lord of it and free. Man, dwelling in the play, is \s{an\=i\'s}, not lord, not
free, subject to Avidya. But this subjection is itself a play of the Ignorance,
unreal in essential fact (\s{param\=artha}), real only in practical relation
(\s{vyavah\=ara}), in the working out of the actions of the divine Energy, the
Chit-Shakti. To get back to the essential fact of his freedom he must recover
the sense of Oneness, the consciousness of Brahman, of the Lord, realise his
oneness in Brahman and with the Lord. Recovering his freedom, realising his
oneness with all existences as becomings of the One Being who is always
himself (\s{so'ham asmi}, He am I), he is able to carry out divine actions in
the world, no longer subject to the Ignorance, because free in the
Knowledge.
\par The perfection of man, therefore, is the full manifestation of the Divine
in the individual through the supreme accord between Vidya and Avidya.
Multiplicity must become conscious of its oneness, Oneness embrace its
multiplicity.
\par
\ht The Extreme Paths
\par The purpose of the Lord in the world cannot be fulfilled by following
Vidya alone or Avidya alone.
\par Those who are devoted entirely to the principle of multiplicity and
division and take their orientation away from oneness enter into a blind
darkness of Ignorance. For this tendency is one of increasing contraction and
limitation, disaggregation of the gains of knowledge and greater and greater
subjection to the mechanical necessities of Prakriti and finally to her
separative and self-destructive forces. To turn away from the progression
towards Oneness is to turn away from existence and from light.
\par Those who are devoted entirely to the principle of indiscriminate Unity
and seek to put away from them the integrality of the Brahman, also put
away from them knowledge and
Page 62

completeness and enter as if into a greater darkness. They enter into some
special state and accept it for the whole, mistaking exclusion in consciousness
for transcendence in consciousness. They ignore by choice of knowledge, as
the others are ignorant by compulsion of error. Knowing all to transcend all is
the right path of Vidya.
\par Although a higher state than the other, this supreme Night is termed a
greater darkness, because the lower is one of chaos from which
reconstitution is always possible, the higher is a conception of Void or Asat,
an attachment to non-existence of Self from which it is more difficult to
return to fulfilment of Self.
\par
\ht The Gains in Either Path
\par Pursued with a less entire attachment the paths of Vidya and Avidya
have each their legitimate gains for the human soul, but neither of these are
the full and perfect thing undertaken by the individual in the manifestation.
\par By Vidya one may attain to the state of the silent Brahman or the
Akshara Purusha regarding the universe without actively participating in it or
to His self-absorbed state of Chit in Sat from which the universe proceeds
and towards which it returns. Both these states are conditions of serenity,
plenitude, freedom from the confusions and sufferings of the world.
\par But the highest goal of man is neither fulfilment in the movement as a
separate individual nor in the Silence separated from the movement, but in the
Uttama Purusha, the Lord, He who went abroad and upholds in Himself both
the Kshara and the Akshara as modes of His being. The self of man, the
Jivatman, is here in order to realise in the individual and for the universe that
one highest Self of all. The ego created by Avidya is a necessary mechanism
for affirming individuality in the universal as a starting-point for this supreme
achievement.
\par By Avidya one may attain to a sort of fullness of power, joy,
world-knowledge, largeness of being, which is that of the Titans or of the
Gods, of Indra, of Prajapati. This is gained in the path of self-enlargement by
an ample acceptance of the multiplicity in all its possibilities and a constant
enrichment of the individual by all the materials that the universe can pour
into him. But this
Page 63

also is not the goal of man; for though it brings transcendence of the ordinary
human limits, it does not bring the divine transcendence of the universe in the
Lord of the universe. One transcends confusion of Ignorance, but not
limitation of Knowledge,—transcends death of the body, but not limitation of
being,—transcends subjection to sorrow, but not subjection to
joy,—transcends the lower Prakriti, but not the higher. To gain the real
freedom and the perfect Immortality one would have to descend again to all
that had been rejected and make the right use of death, sorrow and
ignorance.
\par The real knowledge is that which perceives Brahman in His integrality
and does not follow eagerly after one consciousness rather than another, is
no more attached to Vidya than to Avidya. This was the knowledge of the
ancient sages who were \s{dh\=ira}, steadfast in the gaze of their thought, not
drawn away from the completeness of knowledge by one light or by another
and whose perception of Brahman was consequently entire and
comprehensive and their teaching founded on that perception equally entire
and comprehensive (\s{vicacak\,sire}). It is the knowledge handed down from
these Ancients that is being set forth in the Upanishad.
\par
\ht The Complete Path
\par Brahman embraces in His manifestation both Vidya and Avidya and if
they are both present in the manifestation, it is because they are both
necessary to its existence and its accomplishment. Avidya subsists because
Vidya supports and embraces it; Vidya depends upon Avidya for the
preparation and the advance of the soul towards the great Unity. Neither
could exist without the other; for if either were abolished, they would both
pass away into something which would be neither the one nor the other,
something inconceivable and ineffable beyond all manifestation.
\par In the worst Ignorance there is some point of the knowledge which
constitutes that form of Ignorance and some support of Unity which prevents
it in its most extreme division, limitation, obscurity from ceasing to exist by
dissolving into nothingness. The destiny of the Ignorance is not that it should
be dissolved out
Page 64

of existence, but that its elements should be enlightened, united, that which
they strive to express delivered, fulfilled and in the fulfilment transmuted and
transfigured.
\par In the uttermost unity of which knowledge is capable the contents of the
Multiplicity are inherent and implicit and can any moment be released into
activity. The office of Vidya is not to destroy Avidya as a thing that ought
never to have been manifested but to draw it continually towards itself,
supporting it the while and helping it to deliver itself progressively from that
character of Ignorance, of the oblivion of its essential Oneness, which gives it
its name.
\par Avidya fulfilled by turning more and more to Vidya enables the individual
and the universal to become what the Lord is in Himself, conscious of His
manifestation, conscious of His non-manifestation, free in birth, free in
non-birth.
\par Man represents the point at which the multiplicity in the universe
becomes consciously capable of this turning and fulfilment. His own natural
fulfilment comes by following the complete path of Avidya surrendering itself
to Vidya, the Multiplicity to the Unity, the Ego to the One in all and beyond
all, and of Vidya accepting Avidya into itself, the Unity fulfilling the
Multiplicity, the One manifesting Himself unveiled in the individual and in the
universe.
\par\bl
\ht Mortality and Immortality: Mortality
\par By Avidya fulfilled man passes beyond death, by Vidya accepting
Avidya into itself he enjoys immortality.
\par By death is meant the state of mortality which is a subjection to the
process of constant birth and dying as a limited ego bound to the dualities of
joy and sorrow, good and evil, truth and error, love and hatred, pleasure and
suffering.
\par This state comes by limitation and self-division from the One who is all
and in all and beyond all and by attachment of the idea of self to a single
formation in Time and Space of body, life and mind, by which the Self
excludes from its view all that it verily is with the exception of a mass of
experiences flowing out from and in upon a particular centre and limited by
the capacities of a
Page 65

particular mental, vital and bodily frame. This mass of experiences it
organises around the ego-centre in the mind and linking them together in
Time by a double action of memory, passive in state, active in work, says
continually, “This is I.”
\par The result is that the soul attributes to itself a certain portion only of the
play of Prakriti or Chit-Shakti and consequently a certain limited capacity of
force of consciousness which has to bear all the impact of what the soul does
not regard as itself but as a rush of alien forces; against them it defends its
separate formation of individuality from dissolution into Nature or mastery by
Nature. It seeks to assert in the individual form and by its means its innate
character of Ish or Lord and so to possess and enjoy its world.
\par But by the very definition of the ego its capacity is limited. It accepts as
itself a form made of the movement of Nature which cannot endure in the
general flux of things. It has to form it by the process of the movement and
this is birth, it dissolves it by the process of the movement and this is death.
\par It can master by the understanding only so much of its experiences as
assimilate with its own viewpoint and in a way which must always be
imperfect and subject to error because it is not the view of all or the
viewpoint of the All. Its knowledge is partly error and all the rest it ignores.
\par It can only accept and harmonise itself with a certain number of its
experiences, precisely because these are the only ones it can understand
sufficiently to assimilate. This is its joy; the rest is sorrow or indifference.
\par It is only capable of harmonising with the force in its body, nerves and
mind a certain number of impacts of alien forces. In these it takes pleasure.
The rest it receives with insensibility or pain.
\par Death therefore is the constant denial by the All of the ego's false
self-limitation in the individual frame of mind, life and body.
\par Error is the constant denial by the All of the ego's false sufficiency in a
limited knowledge.
\par Suffering of mind and body is the constant denial by the All of the ego's
attempt to confine the universal Ananda to a false and self-regarding
formation of limited and exclusive enjoyments.
Page 66

\par It is only by accepting the oneness of the All that the individual can
escape from this constant and necessary denial and attain beyond. Then
All-being, All-force, All-consciousness, All-truth, All-delight take possession
of the individual soul. It changes mortality for immortality.
\par
\ht Mortality and Avidya
\par But the way of attaining to immortality is not by the self-dissolution of
the individual formation into the flux of Prakriti, neither is it by prematurely
dissolving it into the All-soul which Prakriti expresses. Man moves towards
something which fulfils the universe by transcending it. He has to prepare his
individual soul for the transcendence and for the fulfilment.
\par If Avidya is the cause of mortality, it is also the path out of mortality.
The limitation has been created precisely in order that the individual may
affirm himself against the flux of Prakriti in order eventually to transcend,
possess and transform it.
\par The first necessity is therefore for man continually to enlarge himself in
being, knowledge, joy, power in the limits of the ego so that he may arrive at
the conception of something which progressively manifests itself in him in
these terms and becomes more and more powerful to deal with the
oppositions of Prakriti and to change, individually, more and more the terms
of ignorance, suffering and weakness into the terms of knowledge, joy and
power and even death into a means of wider life.
\par This self-enlargement has then to awaken to the perception of something
exceeding itself, exceeding the personal manifestation. Man has so to enlarge
his conception of self as to see all in himself and himself in all ({\it verse 6}).
He has to see that this “I” which contains all and is contained in all, is the
One, is universal and not his personal ego. To That he has to subject his ego,
That he has to reproduce in his nature and become, That is what he has to
possess and enjoy with an equal soul in all its forms and movements.
\par He has to see, that this universal One is something entirely transcendent,
the sole Being, and that the universe and all its forms, actions, egos are only
becomings of that Being ({\it verse 7}). World is a becoming which seeks
always to express in motion of
Page 67

Time and Space, by progression in mind, life and body what is beyond all
becoming, beyond Time and Space, beyond mind, life and body.
\par Thus Avidya becomes one with Vidya. By Avidya man passes beyond
that death, suffering, ignorance, weakness which were the first terms he had
to deal with, the first assertions of the One in the birth affirming Himself amid
the limitations and divisions of the Multiplicity. By Vidya he enjoys even in
the birth the Immortality.
\par
\ht Immortality
\par Immortality does not mean survival of the self or the ego after dissolution
of the body. The Self always survives the dissolution of the body, because it
always pre-existed before the birth of the body. The self is unborn and
undying. The survival of the ego is only the first condition by which the
individual soul is able to continue and link together its experiences in Avidya
so as to pursue with an increasing self-possession and mastery that process
of self-enlargement which culminates in Vidya.
\par By immortality is meant the consciousness which is beyond birth and
death, beyond the chain of cause and effect, beyond all bondage and
limitation, free, blissful, self-existent in conscious-being, the consciousness of
the Lord, of the supreme Purusha, of Sachchidananda.
\par
\ht Immortality and Birth
\par On this realisation man can base his free activity in the universe.
\par But having so far attained, what further utility has the soul for birth or for
works? None for itself, everything for God and the universe.
\par Immortality beyond the universe is not the object of manifestation in the
universe, for that the Self always possessed. Man exists in order that through
him the Self may enjoy Immortality in the birth as well as in the
non-becoming.
\par Nor is individual salvation the end; for that would only be the sublime of
the ego, not its self-realisation through the Lord in all.
Page 68

\par Having realised his own immortality, the individual has yet to fulfil God's
work in the universe. He has to help the life, the mind and the body in all
beings to express progressively Immortality and not mortality.
\par This he may do by the becoming in the material body which we
ordinarily call birth, or from some status in another world or even, it is
possible, from beyond world. But birth in the body is the most close, divine
and effective form of help which the liberated can give to those who are
themselves still bound to the progression of birth in the lowest world of the
Ignorance.

\par\bl
\ht The Birth and the Non-Birth
\par The Self outside Nature does not become; it is immutable as well as
eternal. The Self in Nature becomes, it changes its states and forms. This
entry into various states and forms in the succession of Time is Birth in
Nature.
\par Because of these two positions of the Self, in Nature and out of Nature,
moving in the movement and seated above the movement, active in the
development and eating the fruits of the tree of Life or inactive and simply
regarding, there are two possible states of conscious existence directly
opposed to each other of which the human soul is capable, the state of Birth,
the state of Non-Birth.
\par Man starts from the troubled state of Birth, he arrives at that tranquil
poise of conscious existence liberated from the movement which is the
Non-Birth. The knot of the Birth is the ego-sense; the dissolution of the
ego-sense brings us to the Non-Birth. Therefore the Non-Birth is also called
the Dissolution (\s{vin\=a\'sa}).
\par Birth and Non-Birth are not essentially physical conditions, but
soul-states. A man may break the knot of the ego-sense and yet remain in
the physical body; but if he concentrates himself solely in the state of
dissolution of ego, then he is not born again in the body. He is liberated from
birth as soon as the present impulse of Nature which continues the action of
the mind and body has been exhausted. On the other hand if he attaches
Page 70

himself to the Birth, the ego-principle in him seeks continually to clothe itself
in fresh mental and physical forms.
\par
\ht The Evil of the Extremes
\par Neither attachment to Non-Birth nor attachment to Birth is the perfect
way. For all attachment is an act of ignorance and a violence committed upon
the Truth. Its end also is ignorance, a state of blind darkness.
\par Exclusive attachment to Non-Birth leads to a dissolution into
indiscriminate Nature or into the Nihil, into the Void, and both of these are
states of blind darkness. For the Nihil is an attempt not to transcend the state
of existence in birth, but to annul it, not to pass from a limited into an
illimitable existence, but from existence into its opposite. The opposite of
existence can only be the Night of negative consciousness, a state of
ignorance and not of release.
\par On the other hand, attachment to Birth in the body means a constant
self-limitation and an interminable round of egoistic births in the lower forms
of egoism without issue or release. This is, from a certain point of view, a
worse darkness than the other; for it is ignorant even of the impulse of
release. It is not an error in the grasping after truth, but a perpetual
contentment with the state of blindness. It cannot lead even eventually to any
greater good, because it does not dream of any higher condition.
\par
\ht The Good of the Extremes
\par On the other hand each of these tendencies, pursued with a certain
relativeness to the other, has its own fruit and its own good. Non-Birth
pursued as the goal of Birth and a higher, fuller and truer existence may lead
to withdrawal into the silent Brahman or into the pure liberty of the
Non-Being. Birth, pursued as a means of progress and self-enlargement,
leads to a greater and fuller life which may, in its turn, become a vestibule to
the final achievement.
\par
\ht The Perfect Way
\par But neither of these results is perfect in itself nor the true goal of
humanity. Each of them brings its intended portion into
Page 71

the perfect good of the human soul only when it is completed by the other.
\par Brahman is both Vidya and Avidya, both Birth and Non-Birth. The
realisation of the Self as the unborn and the poise of the soul beyond the
dualities of birth and death in the infinite and transcendent existence are the
conditions of a free and divine life in the Becoming. The one is necessary to
the other. It is by participation in the pure unity of the Immobile (Akshara)
Brahman that the soul is released from its absorption in the stream of the
movement. So released it identifies itself with the Lord to whom becoming
and non-becoming are only modes of His existence and is able to enjoy
immortality in the manifestation without being caught in the wheel of Nature's
delusions. The necessity of birth ceases, its personal object having been
fulfilled; the freedom of becoming remains. For the Divine enjoys equally and
simultaneously the freedom of His eternity and the freedom of His becoming.
\par It may even be said that to have had the conscious experience of a
dissolution of the very idea of Being into the supreme Non-Being is
necessary for the fullest and freest possession of Being itself. This would be
from the synthetic standpoint the justification of the great effort of Buddhism
to exceed the conception of all positive being even in its widest or purest
essentiality.
\par Thus by dissolution of ego and of the attachment to birth the soul crosses
beyond death; it is liberated from all limitation in the dualities. Having attained
this liberation it accepts becoming as a process of Nature subject to the soul
and not binding upon it and by this free and divine becoming enjoys
Immortality.
\par
\ht The Justification of Life
\par Thus, the third movement of the Upanishad is a justification of life and
works, which were enjoined upon the seeker of the Truth in its second verse.
Works are the essence of Life. Life is a manifestation of the Brahman; in
Brahman the Life Principle arranges a harmony of the seven principles of
conscious being by which that manifestation works out its involution and
evolution. In Brahman Matarishwan disposes the waters, the sevenfold
movement of the divine Existence.
Page 72

That divine Existence is the Lord who has gone abroad in the movement and
unrolled the universe in His three modes as All-Seer of the Truth of things,
Thinker-out of their possibilities, Realiser of their actualities. He has
determined all things sovereignly in their own nature, development and goal
from years sempiternal.
\par That determination works out through His double power of Vidya and
Avidya, consciousness of essential unity and consciousness of phenomenal
multiplicity.
\par The Multiplicity carried to its extreme limit returns upon itself in the
conscious individual who is the Lord inhabiting the forms of the movement
and enjoying first the play of the Ignorance. Afterwards by development in
the Ignorance the soul returns to the capacity of Knowledge and enjoys by
the Knowledge Immortality.
\par This Immortality is gained by the dissolution of the limited ego and its
chain of births into the consciousness of the unborn and undying, the Eternal,
the Lord, the ever-free. But it is enjoyed by a free and divine becoming in the
universe and not outside the universe; for there it is always possessed, but
here in the material body it is to be worked out and enjoyed by the divine
Inhabitant under circumstances that are in appearance the most opposite to
its terms, in the life of the individual and in the multiple life of the universe.
\par Life has to be transcended in order that it may be freely accepted; the
works of the universe have to be over-passed in order that they may be
divinely fulfilled.
\par The soul even in apparent bondage is really free and only plays at being
bound; but it has to go back to the consciousness of freedom and possess and
enjoy universally not this or that but the Divine and the All.

\par
\ht The Worlds After Death
\par In the third verse the Upanishad has spoken of sunless worlds enveloped
in blind gloom. In its third movement it also speaks twice of the soul entering
into a blind gloom, but here it is a state of consciousness that seems to be
indicated and not a world. Nevertheless, the two statements differ little in
effect; for in the Vedantic conception a world is only a condition of conscious
being organised in the terms of the seven constituent principles of manifested
existence. According to the state of consciousness which we reach here in
the body, will be our state of consciousness and the surroundings organised
by it when the mental being passes out of the body. For the individual soul out
of the body must either disappear into the general constituents of its
existence, merge itself into Brahman or persist in an organisation of
consciousness other than the terrestrial and in relations with the universe
other than those which are appropriate to life in the body. This state of
consciousness and the relations belonging to it are the other worlds, the
worlds after death.
\par
\ht The Three States
\par The Upanishad admits three states of the soul in relation to the
manifested universe,—terrestrial life by birth in the body, the survival of the
individual soul after death in other states and the immortal existence which
being beyond birth and death, beyond manifestation can yet enter into forms
as the Inhabitant and embrace Nature as its lord. The two former conditions
appertain to the Becoming; Immortality stands in the Self, in the
Page 74

Non-Birth, and enjoys the Becoming.
\par The Upanishad, although it does not speak expressly of rebirth in an
earthly body, yet implies that belief in its thought and language,—especially in
the 17th verse. On the basis of this belief in rebirth man may aim at three
distinct objects beyond death,—a better or more fortunate life or lives upon
earth, eternal enjoyment of bliss in an ultra-terrestrial world of light and joy or
a transcendence exclusive of all universal existence, merged in the Supreme
as in one is true self, but having no relation with the actual or possible
contents of its infinite consciousness.
\par
\ht Rebirth
\par The attainment of a better life or lives upon earth is not the
consummation offered to the soul by the thought of the Upanishad. But it is
an important intermediate object so long as the soul is in a state of growth
and self-enlargement and has not attained to liberation. The obligation of birth
and death is a sign that the mental being has not yet unified itself with its true
supra-mental self and spirit, but is dwelling “in Avidya and enclosed within
it”.
\note{\s{Avidy\=ay\=am antare vartam\=an\=a\,h}.— Katha Upanishad I. 2. 5;
Mundaka I. 2. 8.} To attain that union the life of man upon earth is its
appointed means. After liberation the soul is free, but may still participate in
the entire movement and return to birth no longer for its own sake but for the
sake of others and according to the will in it of its divine Self, the Lord of its
movement.
\par
\ht Heaven and Hell
\par The enjoyment of beatitude in a heaven beyond is also not the supreme
consummation. But Vedantic thought did not envisage rebirth as an
immediate entry after death into a new body; the mental being in man is not
so rigidly bound to the vital and physical,—on the contrary, the latter are
ordinarily dissolved together after death, and there must therefore be, before
the soul is attracted back towards terrestrial existence, an interval in which it
assimilates its terrestrial experiences in order to be able to constitute a new
vital and physical being upon
Page 75

earth. During this interval it must dwell in states or worlds beyond and these
may be favourable or unfavourable to its future development. They are
favourable in proportion as the light of the Supreme Truth of which Surya is a
symbol enters into them, but states of intermediate ignorance or darkness are
harmful to the soul in its progress. Those enter into them, as has been
affirmed in the third verse, who do hurt to themselves by shutting themselves
to the light or distorting the natural course of their development. The
Vedantic heavens are states of light and the soul's expansion; darkness,
self-obscuration and self-distortion are the nature of the Hells which it has to
shun.
\par In relation to the soul's individual development, therefore, the life in
worlds beyond, like the life upon earth, is a means and not an object in itself.
After liberation the soul may possess these worlds as it possesses the
material birth, accepting in them a means towards the divine manifestation in
which they form a condition of its fullness, each being one of the parts in a
series of organised states of conscious being which is linked with and
supports all the rest.
\par
\ht Transcendence
\par Transcendence is the goal of the development, but it does not exclude
the possession of that which is transcended. The soul need not and should not
push transcendence so far as to aim at its own extinction. Nirvana is
extinction of the ego-limitations, but not of all possibility of manifestation,
since it can be possessed even in the body.
\par The desire of the exclusive liberation is the last desire that the soul in its
expanding knowledge has to abandon; the delusion that it is bound by birth is
the last delusion that it has to destroy.
\par
\ht Surya and Agni
\par On the basis of this conception of the worlds and the relation of these
different soul-states to each other the Upanishad proceeds to indicate the two
lines of knowledge and action which lead to the supreme vision and the divine
felicity. This is done under the form of an invocation to Surya and Agni, the
Page 76

Vedic godheads, representative one of the supreme Truth and its
illuminations, the other of the divine Will raising, purifying and perfecting
human action.
\par
\ht The Order of the Worlds
\par To understand entirely the place and function of Surya we must enter a
little more profoundly into the Vedic conception of the seven worlds and the
principles of consciousness they represent.
\par All conscious being is one and indivisible in itself, but in manifestation it
becomes a complex rhythm, a scale of harmonies, a hierarchy of states or
movements. For what we call a state is only the organisation of a complex
movement. This hierarchy is composed by a descending or involutive and an
ascending or evolutive movement of which Spirit and Matter are the highest
and lowest terms.
\par Spirit is Sat or pure existence, pure in self-awareness (Chit), pure in
self-delight (Ananda). Therefore Spirit can be regarded as a triune basis of
all conscious being. There are three terms, but they are really one. For all
pure existence is in its essence pure self-conscience and all pure
self-conscience is in its essence pure self-delight. At the same time our
consciousness is capable of separating these three by the Idea and the Word
and even of creating for itself in its divided or limited movements the sense of
their apparent opposites.
\par An integral intuition into the nature of conscious being shows us that it is
indeed one in essence, but also that it is capable of an infinite potential
complexity and multiplicity in self-experience. The working of this potential
complexity and multiplicity in the One is what we call from our point of view
manifestation or creation or world or becoming—(\s{bhuvana}, \s{bh\=ava}).
Without it no world-existence is possible.
\par The agent of this becoming is always the self-conscience of the Being.
The power by which the self-conscience brings out of itself its potential
complexities is termed Tapas, Force or Energy, and, being self-conscious, is
obviously of the nature of Will. But not Will as we understand it, something
exterior to its object, other than its works, labouring on material outside itself,
but Will
Page 77

inherent in the Being, inherent in the becoming, one with the movement of
existence,—self-conscious Will that becomes what it sees and knows in
itself, Will that is expressed as Force of its own work and formulates itself in
the result of its work. By this Will, Tapas or Chit-Shakti, the worlds are
created.
\par
\ht The Higher Worlds
\par All organisation of self-conscient being which takes as its basis the unity
of pure existence belongs to the world of the highest creation,
\s{par\=ardha},—the worlds of the Spirit.
\par We can conceive three principal formations.
\par When \s{tapas} or energy of self-conscience dwells upon \s{sat} or
pure existence as its basis, the result is \s{satyaloka} or world of true
existence. The soul in \s{satyaloka} is one with all its manifestations by
oneness of essence and therefore one in self-conscience and in energy of
self-conscience and one also in bliss.
\par When \s{tapas} dwells upon active power of \s{cit} as its basis, the
result is \s{tapoloka} or world of energy of self-conscience. The soul in
\s{tapoloka} is one with all manifestations in this Energy and therefore enjoys
oneness also in the totality of their bliss and possesses equally their unity of
essence.
\par When \s{tapas} dwells upon active Delight of being as its basis, the
result is \s{janaloka}, world of creative Delight. The soul in \s{janaloka} is
one in delight of being with all manifestation and through that bliss one also in
conscious energy and in essence of being.
\par All these are states of consciousness in which unity and multiplicity have
not yet been separated from each other. All is in all, each in all and all in
each, inherently, by the very nature of conscious being and without effort of
conception or travail of perception. There is no night, no obscurity. Neither is
there, properly speaking, any dominant action of illuminating Surya. For the
whole of consciousness there is self-luminous and needs no light other than
itself. The distinct existence of Surya is lost in the oneness of the Lord or
Purusha; that luminous oneness is Surya's most blessed form of all.
\par
\ht The Lower Creation
\par In the lower creation also there are three principles, Matter,
Page 78

Life, and Mind. Sat or pure existence appears there as extended substance or
Matter; Will or Force appears as Life which is in its nature creative or
manifesting Force and that Force is in its nature a self-conscient will involved
and obscure in the forms of its creation. It is liberated from the involution and
obscurity by delight of being struggling to become conscious of itself in desire
and sensation; the result is the emergence of Mind. So at least it appears to
us in the ascending or evolutive movement.
\par Wherever there is Matter, Life and Mind are present involved or
evolving. So also, Life and Mind have some kind of material form as the
condition of their activities. These three appear not as triune, owing to their
domination by the dividing principle of Avidya, but as triple.
\par In the organisation of consciousness to which we belong, Tapas dwells
upon Matter as its basis. Our consciousness is determined by the divisibility
of extended substance in its apparent forms. This is Bhurloka, the material
world, the world of formal becoming.
\par But we may conceive of a world in which dynamic Life-force with
sensation emergent in it is the basis and determines without the gross
obstacle of Matter the forms that it shall take. This organisation of
consciousness has for its field Bhuvarloka, the world of free vital becoming in
form.
\par We may conceive also of an organised state of consciousness in which
Mind liberates itself from subjection to material sensation and becoming
dominant determines its own forms instead of being itself determined by the
forms in which it finds itself as a result of life evolution. This formation is
Swarloka or world of free, pure and luminous mentality.
\par In these lower worlds consciousness is normally broken up and divided.
The light of Surya, the Truth, is imprisoned in the night of the subconscient or
appears only reflected in limited centres or with its rays received by those
centres and utilised according to their individual nature.
\par
\ht The Intermediate World
\par Between these two creations, linking them together, is the world or
organisation of consciousness of which the infinite Truth
Page 79

of things is the foundation. There dominant individualisation no longer usurps
the all-pervading soul and the foundation of consciousness is its own vast
totality arranging in itself individualised movements which never lose the
consciousness of their integrality and total oneness with all others. Multiplicity
no longer prevails and divides, but even in the complexity of its movements
always refers back to essential unity and its own integral totality. This world
is therefore called Maharloka or world of large consciousness.
\par The principle of Maharloka is Vijnana, the Idea. But this Vijnana is
intuitional or rather gnostic Idea,
\note{Intuition (revelation, inspiration, intuitive perception, intuitive
discrimination) is Vijnana working in mind under the conditions and in the
forms of mind. Gnosis or true supermind is a power above mind working in its
own law, out of the direct identity of the supreme Self, his absolute
self-conscious Truth knowing herself by her own power of absolute Light
without any need of seeking, even the most luminous seeking.} not
intellectual conception. The difference is that intellectual conception not only
tends towards form, but determines itself in the form of the idea and once
determined distinguishes itself sharply from other conceptions. But pure
intuitional or gnostic Idea sees itself in the Being as well as in the Becoming.
It is one with the existence which throws out the form as a symbol of itself
and it therefore carries with it always the knowledge of the Truth behind the
form. It is in its nature self-conscience of the being and power of the One,
aware always of its totality, starting therefore from the totality of all
existence and perceiving directly its contents. Its nature is \s{d\,r\,s\,ti}, seeing,
not conceiving. It is the vision at once of the essence and the image. It is this
intuition or gnosis which is the Vedic Truth, the self-vision and all-vision of
Surya.
\par
\ht The Law of the Truth
\par The face of this Truth is covered as with a brilliant shield, as with a
golden lid; covered, that is to say, from the view of our human consciousness.
For we are mental beings and our highest ordinary mental sight is composed
of the concepts and percepts of the mind, which are indeed a means of
knowledge, rays of the Truth, but not in their nature truth of existence, only
truth of form. By them we arrange our knowledge of the appearances of
things and try to infer the truth behind. The true knowledge is
Page 80

truth of existence, \s{satyam}, not mere truth of form or appearance.
\par We can only arrive at the true Truth, if Surya works in us to remove this
brilliant formation of concepts and percepts and replaces them by the
self-vision and all-vision.
\par For this it is necessary that the law and action of the Truth should be
manifested in us. We must learn to see things as they are, see ourselves as
we are. Our present action is one in which self-knowledge and will are
divided. We start with a fundamental falsehood, that we have a separate
existence from others and we try to know the relations of separate beings in
their separateness and act on the knowledge so formed for an individual
utility. The law of the Truth would work in us if we saw the totality of our
existence containing all others, its forms created by the action of the totality,
its powers working in and by the action of the totality. Our internal and
external action would then well naturally and directly out of our
self-existence, out of the very truth of things and not in obedience to an
intermediate principle which is in its nature a falsifying reflection.
\par
\ht The Fulfilment of Surya in Man
\par Nevertheless even in our ordinary action there is the beginning or at least
the seed of the Truth which must liberate us. Behind every act and
perception there is an intuition, a truth which, if it is continually falsified in the
form, yet preserves itself in the essence and works to lead us by increasing
light and largeness to truth in the manifestation. Behind all this travail of
differentiation and division there is an insistent unifying tendency which is
also continually falsified in the separate result, but yet leads persistently
towards our eventual integrality in knowledge, in being and in will.
\par Surya is Pushan, fosterer or increaser. His work must be to effect this
enlargement of the divided self-perception and action of will into the integral
will and knowledge. He is sole seer and replacing other forms of knowledge
by his unifying vision enables us to arrive finally at oneness. That intuitive
vision of the totality, of one in All and All in one, becomes the ordainer of the
right law of action in us, the law of the Truth. For Surya is Yama, the
Ordainer or Controller who assures the law, the
Page 81

dharma. Thus we arrive at the fullness of action of the Illuminer in us,
accomplish the entirety of the Truth-Consciousness. We are then able to see
that all that is contained in the being of Surya, in the Vijnana which builds up
the worlds is becoming of existence in the one existence and one Lord of all
becoming, the Purusha, Sachchidananda. All becoming is born in the Being
who himself exceeds all becomings and is their Lord, Prajapati.
\par By the revelation of the vision of Surya the true knowledge is formed. In
this formation the Upanishad indicates two successive actions. First, there is
an arrangement or marshalling of the rays of Surya, that is to say, the truths
concealed behind our concepts and percepts are brought out by separate
intuitions of the image and the essence of the image and arranged in their
true relations to each other. So we arrive at totalities of intuitive knowledge
and can finally go beyond to unity. This is the drawing together of the light of
Surya. This double movement is necessitated by the constitution of our minds
which cannot, like the original Truth-consciousness, start at once from the
totality and perceive its contents from within. The mind can hardly conceive
unity except as an abstraction, a sum or a void. Therefore it has to be
gradually led from its own manner to that which exceeds it. It has to carry
out its own characteristic action of arrangement, but with the help and by the
operation of the higher faculty, no longer arbitrarily, but following the very
action of the Truth of existence itself. Afterwards, by thus gradually
correcting the manner of its own characteristic action it can succeed in
reversing that characteristic action itself and learn to proceed from the whole
to the contents instead of proceeding from “parts”
\note{There are really no parts, existence being indivisible.} mistaken for
entities to an apparent whole which is still a “part” and still mistaken for an
entity.
\par
\ht The One Existent
\par Thus by the action of Surya we arrive at that light of the supreme
super-conscient in which even the intuitive knowledge of the truth of things
based upon the total vision passes into the self-luminous self-vision of the one
existent, one in all infinite
Page 82

complexities of a self-experience which never loses its unity or its
self-luminousness. This is Surya's godliest form of all. For it is the supreme
Light, the supreme Will, the supreme Delight of existence.
\par This is the Lord, the Purusha, the self-conscient Being. When we have
this vision, there is the integral self-knowledge, the perfect seeing, expressed
in the great cry of the Upanishad, \s{so'ham}. The Purusha there and there,
He am I. The Lord manifests Himself in the movements and inhabits many
forms, but it is One who inhabits all. This self-conscient being, this real “I”
whom the mental being individualised in the form is aware of as his true
self—it is He. It is the All; and it is that which transcends the All.

which enables it eventually to pass beyond itself, we have the first principle
of progress from mortality to immortality. It is by the Sun as a door or
gate
\note{\s{S\=uryadv\=are\,na}.—Mundaka Upanishad I. 2. 11.} that the individual,
the limited consciousness attains to the full consciousness and life in the one,
supreme and all-embracing Soul.
\par Both consciousness and life are included in the formula of Immortality;
Knowledge is incomplete without action. Chit fulfils itself by Tapas,
Consciousness by energy. And as Surya represents the divine Light, so Agni
to the ancient Rishis represented divine Force, Power or
Will-in-Consciousness. The prayer to Agni completes the prayer to Surya.
\par
\ht The Individual Will
\par As in knowledge, so in action, unity is the true foundation. The individual,
accepting division as his law, isolating himself in his own egoistic limits, is
necessarily mortal, obscure and ignorant in his workings. He follows in his
aims and in his methods a knowledge that is personal, governed by desire,
habits of thought, obscure subconscious impulses or, at best, a broken partial
and shifting light. He lives by rays and not in the full blaze of the Sun. His
knowledge is narrow in its objectivity, narrow in its subjectivity, in neither one
with the integral
Page 84

knowledge and the total working and total will in the universe. His action,
therefore, is crooked, many-branching, hesitating and fluctuating in its
impulsion and direction; it beats about among falsehoods to find the Truth,
tosses or scraps fragments together to piece out the whole, stumbles among
errors and sins to find the right. Being neither one-visioned nor
whole-visioned, having neither the totality of the universal Will nor the
concentrated oneness of the transcendent, the individual will cannot walk
straight on the right or good path towards the Truth and the Immortality.
Governed by desire, exposed to the shock of the forces around it with which
its egoism and ignorance forbid it to put itself in harmony, it is subject to the
twin children of the Ignorance, suffering and falsehood. Not having the divine
Truth and Right, it cannot have the divine Felicity.
\par
\ht Agni, The Divine Will
\par But as there is in and behind all the falsehoods of our material mind and
reason a Light that prepares by this twilight the full dawn of the Truth in man,
so there is in and behind all our errors, sins and stumblings a secret Will,
tending towards Love and Harmony, which knows where it is going and
prepares and combines our crooked branchings towards the straight path
which will be the final result of their toil and seeking. The emergence of this
Will and that Light is the condition of immortality.
\par This Will is Agni. Agni is in the Rig-veda, from which the closing verse
of the Upanishad is taken, the flame of the Divine Will or Force of
Consciousness working in the worlds. He is described as the immortal in
mortals, the leader of the journey, the divine Horse that bears us on the road,
the “son of crookedness” who himself knows and is the straightness and the
Truth. Concealed and hard to seize in the workings of this world because
they are all falsified by desire and egoism, he uses them to transcend them
and emerges as the universal in Man or universal Power, Agni Vaishwanara,
who contains in himself all the gods and all the worlds, upholds all the
universal workings and finally fulfils the godhead, the immortality. He is the
worker of the divine Work. It is these symbols which govern the sense of the
two final verses of the Upanishad.
Page 85

\par
\ht The Immortal Life-Principle
\par Life is the condition from which the Will and the Light emerge. It is said
in the Veda that Vayu or Matarishwan, the Life-principle, is he who brings
down Agni from Surya in the high and far-off supreme world. Life calls
down the divine Will from the Truth-Consciousness into the realm of mind
and body to prepare here, in Life, its own manifestation. Agni, enjoying and
devouring the things of Life, generates the Maruts, nervous forces of Life
that become forces of thought; they, upheld by Agni, prepare the action of
Indra, the luminous Mind, who is for our life-powers their Rishi or finder of
the Truth and Right. Indra slays Vritra, the Coverer, dispels the darkness,
causes Surya to rise upon our being and go abroad over its whole field with
the rays of the Truth. Surya is the Creator or manifester, Savitri, who
manifests in this mortal world the world or state of immortality, dispels the
evil dream of egoism, sin and suffering and transforms Life into the
immortality, the good, the beatitude. The Vedic gods are a parable of human
life emerging, mounting, lifting itself towards the Godhead.
\par Life, body, action, will, these are our first materials. Matter supplies us
with the body; but it is only a temporary knot of the movement, a
dwelling-place of the Purusha in which he presides over the activities
generated out of the Life-principle. Once it is thrown aside by the
Life-principle it is dissolved; ashes are its end. Therefore the body is not
ourselves, but only an outer tool and instrument. For Matter is the principle of
obscurity and division, of birth and death, of formation and dissolution. It is
the assertion of death. Immortal man must not identify himself with the body.
\par The Life-principle in us survives. It is the immortal Breath
\note{\s{Anilam am\,rtam}.} or, as the phrase really means, the subtle force
of existence which is superior to the principle of birth and death. At first sight
it may appear that birth and death are attributes of the Life, but it is not really
so: birth and death are processes of Matter, of the body. The Life-principle is
not formed and dissolved in the formulation and dissolution of the body; if that
were so, there could be no continuity of the individual existence and all would
go back
Page 86

at death into the formless. Life forms body, it is not formed by it. It is the
thread upon which the continuity of our successive bodily lives is arranged,
precisely because it is itself immortal. It associates itself with the perishable
body and carries forward the mental being, the Purusha in the mind, upon his
journey.
\par
\ht Will and Memory
\par This journey consists in a series of activities continued from life to life in
this world with intervals of life in other states. The Life-principle maintains
them; it supplies their material in the formative energy which takes shape in
them. But their presiding god is not the Life-principle; it is the Will. Will is
\s{kratu}, the effective power behind the act. It is of the nature of
consciousness; it is energy of consciousness, and although present in all
forms, conscious, subconscious or superconscious, vital, physical or mental,
yet comes into its kingdom only when it emerges in Mind. It uses the mental
faculty of memory to link together and direct consciously the activities
towards the goal of the individual.
\par In man the use of consciousness by the mental will is imperfect, because
memory is limited. Our action is both dispersed and circumscribed because
mentally we live from hour to hour in the current of Time, holding only to that
which attracts or seems immediately useful to our egoistic mind. We live in
what we are doing, we do not control what has been done, but are rather
controlled by our past works which we have forgotten. This is because we
dwell in the action and its fruits instead of living in the soul and viewing the
stream of action from behind it. The Lord, the true Will, stands back from the
actions and therefore is their lord and not bound by them.
\par The Upanishad solemnly invokes the Will to remember the thing that has
been done, so as to contain and be conscious of the becoming, so as to
become a power of knowledge and self-possession and not only a power of
impulsion and self-formulation. It will thus more and more approximate itself
to the true Will and preside over the co-ordination of the successive lives with
a conscious control. Instead of being carried from life to life in a crooked
path, as by winds, it will be able to proceed more and more straight in an
ordered series, linking life to life
Page 87

with an increasing force of knowledge and direction until it becomes the fully
conscious Will moving with illumination on the straight path towards the
immortal felicity. The mental will, \s{kratu}, becomes what it at present only
represents, the divine Will, Agni.
\par
\ht Will and Knowledge
\par The essentiality of the divine Will is that in it Consciousness and Energy,
Knowledge and Force are one. It knows all manifestations, all things that
take birth in the worlds. It is Jatavedas, that which has right knowledge of all
births. It knows them in the law of their being, in their relation to other births,
in their aim and method, in their process and goal, in their unity with all and
their difference from all. It is this divine Will that conducts the universe; it is
one with all the things that it combines and its being, its knowledge, its action
are inseparable from each other. What it is, it knows; what it knows, that it
does and becomes.
\par But as soon as egoistic consciousness emerges and interferes, there is a
disturbance, a division, a false action. Will becomes an impulsion ignorant of
its secret motive and aim, knowledge becomes a dubious and partial ray not
in possession of the will, the act and the result, but only striving to possess
and inform them. This is because we are not in possession of our
self,
\note{\s{\=atmav\=an}.} our true being, but only of the ego. What we are, we
know not; what we know, we cannot effect. For knowledge is real and action
in harmony with true knowledge only when they proceed naturally out of the
conscious, illumined and self possessing soul, in which being, knowledge and
action are one movement.
\par
\ht Surrender to the Divine Will
\par This is the change that happens when, the mental will approximating
more and more to the divine, Agni burns out in us. It is that increasing
knowledge and force which carries us finally into the straight or good path
out of the crookedness. It is the divine Will, one with the divine knowledge,
which leads us towards felicity, towards the state of Immortality. All that
belongs to the deviations of the ego, all that obscures and drives or
Page 88

draws us into this or that false path with its false lures and stumblings are put
away from us by it. These things fall away from the divinised Will and cease
to find lodging in our consciousness.
\par Therefore the sign of right action is the increasing and finally the
complete submission of the individual to the divine Will which the illumination
of Surya reveals in him. Although manifested in his consciousness, this Will is
not individual. It is the will of the Purusha who is in all things and transcends
them. It is the will of the Lord.
\par Knowledge of the Lord as the One in the fully self-conscious being,
submission to the Lord as the universal and transcendent in the fully
self-conscious action, are the two keys of the divine gates, the gates of
Immortality.
\par And the nature of the two united is an illuminated Devotion which
accepts, aspires to and fulfils God in the human existence.
\par
\ht Conclusion
\par Thus the fourth movement indicates psychologically the double process
of that attainment of Immortality which is the subject of the third movement,
the state of bliss and truth within and the worlds of Light after death
culminating in the identity of the self-luminous One. At the same time it
particularises under the cover of Vedic symbols the process of that
self-knowledge and identification with the Self and all its becomings which is
the subject of the second movement and of that liberated action in the
assertion of which the first culminates. It is thus a fitting close and
consummation to the Upanishad.

\ht Conclusion and Summary
\par\drop The Isha Upanishad is one of the more ancient of the Vedantic
writings in style, substance and versification, subsequent certainly to the
Chhandogya, Brihadaranyaka and perhaps to the Taittiriya and Aitareya, but
certainly the most antique of the extant metrical Upanishads. Upanishadic
thought falls naturally into two great periods; in one, the earlier, it still kept
close to its Vedic roots, reflected the old psychological system of the Vedic
Rishis and preserved what may be called their spiritual pragmatism; in the
other and later, in which the form and thought became more modern and
independent of early symbols and origins, some of the principal elements of
Vedic thought and psychology begin to be omitted or to lose their previous
connotation and the foundations of the later ascetic and anti-pragmatic
Vedanta begin to appear. The Isha belongs to the earlier or Vedic group. It is
already face to face with the problem of reconciling human life and activity
with the Monistic standpoint and its large solution of the difficulty is one of
the most interesting passages of Vedantic literature. It is the sole Upanishad
which offered almost insuperable difficulties to the extreme illusionism and
anti-pragmatism of Shankaracharya and it was even, for this reason, excised
from the list of authoritative Upanishads by one of his greatest followers.
\par
\ht The Principle of The Upanishad
\par The principle it follows throughout is the uncompromising reconciliation
of uncompromising extremes. Later thought took one series of terms,—the
World, Enjoyment, Action, the Many, Birth, the Ignorance,—and gave them a
more and more secondary position, exalting the opposite series, God,
Renunciation, Quietism, the One, Cessation of Birth, the Knowledge until this
trend of thought culminated in Illusionism and the idea of existence in the
world as a snare and a meaningless burden imposed inexplicably on the soul
by itself, which must be cast aside as
Page 90

soon as possible. It ended in a violent cutting of the knot of the great enigma.
This Upanishad tries instead to get hold of the extreme ends of the knots,
disengage and place them alongside of each other in a release that will be at
the same time a right placing and relation. It will not qualify or subordinate
unduly any of the extremes, although it recognises a dependence of one on
the other. Renunciation is to go to the extreme, but also enjoyment is to be
equally integral; Action has to be complete and ungrudging, but also freedom
of the soul from its works must be absolute; Unity utter and absolute is the
goal but this absoluteness has to be brought to its highest term by including in
it the whole infinite multiplicity of things.
\par So great is this scruple in the Upanishad that having so expressed itself
in the formula “By the Ignorance having crossed over death by the
knowledge one enjoys Immortality” that Life in the world might be
interpreted as only a preliminary to an existence beyond, it at once rights the
balance by reversing the order in the parallel formula “By dissolution having
crossed over death by birth one enjoys Immortality”, and thus makes life
itself the field of the immortal existence which is the goal and aspiration of all
life. In this conclusion it agrees with the early Vedic thought which believed
all the worlds and existence and non-existence and death and life and
immortality to be here in the embodied human being, there evolvent, there
realisable and to be possessed and enjoyed, not dependent either for
acquisition or enjoyment on the renunciation of life and bodily existence. This
thought has never entirely passed out of Indian philosophy, but has become
secondary and a side admission not strong enough to qualify seriously the
increasing assertion of the extinction of mundane existence as the condition
of our freedom and our sole wise and worthy aim.
\par
\ht The Opposites
\par The pairs of opposites successively taken up by the Upanishad and
resolved are, in the order of their succession:
\par 1. The Conscious Lord and phenomenal Nature.
\par 2. Renunciation and Enjoyment.
\par 3. Action in Nature and Freedom in the Soul.
Page 91

\par 4. The One stable Brahman and the multiple Movement.
\par 5. Being and Becoming.
\par 6. The Active Lord and the indifferent Akshara Brahman.
\par 7. Vidya and Avidya.
\par 8. Birth and Non-Birth.
\par 9. Works and Knowledge.
\par These discords are thus successively resolved:
\par
\ht God and Nature
\par 1. Phenomenal Nature is a movement of the conscious Lord. The object
of the movement is to create forms of His consciousness in motion in which
He as the one soul in many bodies can take up his habitation and enjoy the
multiplicity and the movement with all their relations.
\note{This is also the view of the Gita and generally accepted.}
\par
\ht Enjoyment and Renunciation
\par 2. Real integral enjoyment of all this movement and multiplicity in its
truth and in its infinity depends upon an absolute renunciation; but the
renunciation intended is an absolute renunciation of the principle of desire
founded on the principle of egoism and not a renunciation of
world-existence.
\note{This, again, is the central standpoint of the Gita, which, however,
admits also the renunciation of world-existence. The general trend of
Vedantic thought would accept the renunciation of desire and egoism as the
essential but would hold that renunciation of egoism means the renunciation
of all world-existence, for it sees desire and not Ananda as the cause of
world existence.} This solution depends on the idea that desire is only an
egoistic and vital deformation of the divine Ananda or delight of being from
which the world is born; by extirpation of ego and desire Ananda again
becomes the conscious principle of existence. This substitution is the essence
of the change from life in death to life in immortality. The enjoyment of the
infinite delight of existence free from ego, founded on oneness of all in the
Lord, is what is meant by the enjoyment of Immortality.
\par
\ht Action and Freedom
\par 3. Actions are not inconsistent with the soul's freedom. Man is not bound
by works, but only seems to be bound. He has
Page 92

to recover the consciousness of his inalienable freedom by recovering the
consciousness of unity in the Lord, unity in himself, unity with all
existence.
\note{This truth would, again, be generally admitted, but not the conclusion
that is drawn from it.} This done, life and works can and should be accepted
in their fullness; for the manifestation of the Lord in life and works is the law
of our being and the object of our world-existence.
\par
\ht The Quiescence and the Movement
\par 4. What then of the Quiescence of the Supreme Being and how is
persistence in the Movement compatible with that Quiescence which is
generally recognised as an essential condition of the supreme Bliss?
\par The Quiescence and the Movement are equally one Brahman and the
distinction drawn between them is only a phenomenon of our consciousness.
So it is with the idea of space and time, the far and the near, the subjective
and the objective, internal and external, myself and others, one and many.
Brahman, the real existence, is all these things to our consciousness, but in
itself ineffably superior to all such practical distinctions. The Movement is a
phenomenon of the Quiescence, the Quiescence itself may be conceived as a
Movement too rapid for the gods, that is to say, for our various functions of
consciousness to follow in its real nature. But it is no formal, material, spatial,
temporal movement, only a movement in consciousness. Knowledge sees it
all as one, Ignorance divides and creates oppositions where there is no
opposition but simply relations of one consciousness in itself. The ego in the
body says, “I am within, all else is outside; and in what is outside, this is near
to me in Time and Space, that is far.” All this is true in present relation; but in
essence it is all one indivisible movement of Brahman which is not material
movement but a way of seeing things in the one consciousness.
\par
\ht Being and Becoming
\par 5. Everything depends on what we see, how we look at existence in our
soul's view of things. Being and Becoming, One and Many are both true and
are both the same thing: Being
Page 93

is one, Becomings are many; but this simply means that all Becomings are
one Being who places Himself variously in the phenomenal movement of His
consciousness. We have to see the One Being, but we have not to cease to
see the many Becomings, for they exist and are included in Brahman's view
of Himself. Only, we must see with knowledge and not with ignorance. We
have to realise our true self as the one unchangeable, indivisible Brahman.
We have to see all becomings as developments of the movement in our true
self and this self as one inhabiting all bodies and not our body only. We have
to be consciously, in our relations with this world, what we really are,—this
one self becoming everything that we observe. All the movement, all
energies, all forms, all happenings we must see as those of our one and real
self in many existences, as the play of the Will and Knowledge and Delight of
the Lord in His world-existence.
\par We shall then be delivered from egoism and desire and the sense of
separate existence and therefore from all grief and delusion and shrinking; for
all grief is born of the shrinking of the ego from the contacts of existence, its
sense of fear, weakness, want, dislike, etc.; and this is born from the delusion
of separate existence, the sense of being my separate ego exposed to all
these contacts of so much that is not myself. Get rid of this, see oneness
everywhere, be the One manifesting Himself in all creatures; ego will
disappear; desire born of the sense of not being this, not having that, will
disappear; the free inalienable delight of the One in His own existence will
take the place of desire and its satisfactions and dissatisfactions.
\note{In the ordinary view all this would be admitted, but the practical
possibility of maintaining this state of consciousness and birth in the world
together would be doubted.} Immortality will be yours, death born of division
will be overcome.
\par
\ht The Active and Inactive Brahman
\par 6. The Inactive and the Active Brahman are simply two aspects of the
one Self, the one Brahman, who is the Lord. It is He who has gone abroad in
the movement. He maintains Himself free from all modifications in His
inactive existence. The inaction is the basis of the action and exists in the
action; it is His
Page 94

freedom from all He does and becomes and in all He does and becomes.
These are the positive and negative poles of one indivisible consciousness.
We embrace both in one quiescence and one movement, inseparable from
each other, dependent on each other. The quiescence exists relatively to the
movement, the movement to the quiescence. He is beyond both. This is a
different point of view from that of the identity of the Movement and
Quiescence which are one in reality; it expresses rather their relation in our
consciousness once they are admitted as a practical necessity of that
consciousness. It is obvious that we also by becoming one with the Lord
would share in this biune conscious existence.
\note{In the ordinary view the Jiva cannot exist in both at the same time; his
dissolution is into the Quiescence and not into unity with the Lord in the
action and inaction.}
\par
\ht Vidya and Avidya
\par 7. The knowledge of the One and the knowledge of the Many are a
result of the movement of the one consciousness, which sees all things as
One in their truth-Idea but differentiates them in their mentality and formal
becoming. If the mind (\s{man\=i\,s\=i}) absorbs itself in God as the formal
becoming (\s{paribh\=u}) and separates itself from God in the true Idea
(\s{kavi}), then it loses Vidya, the knowledge of the One, and has only the
knowledge of the Many which becomes no longer knowledge at all but
ignorance, Avidya. This is the cause of the separate ego-sense.
\par Avidya is accepted by the Lord in the Mind (\s{man\=i\,s\=i}) in order to
develop individual relations to their utmost in all the possibilities of division and
its consequences and then through these individual relations to come back
individually to the knowledge of the One in all. That knowledge has remained
all along unabrogated in the consciousness of the true seer or Kavi. This seer
in ourselves stands back from the mental thinker; the latter, thus separated,
has to conquer death and division by a developing experience as the individual
Inhabitant and finally to recover by the reunited knowledge of the One and
the Many the state of Immortality. This is our proper course and not either to
devote ourselves exclusively to the life of Avidya or to reject it entirely for
motionless absorption in the One.
Page 95

\par
\ht Birth and Non-Birth
\par 8. The reason for this double movement of the Thinker is that we are
intended to realise immortality in the Birth. The self is uniform and undying
and in itself always possesses immortality. It does not need to descend into
Avidya and Birth to get that immortality of Non-Birth; for it possesses it
always. It descends in order to realise and possess it as the individual
Brahman in the play of world-existence. It accepts Birth and Death, assumes
the ego and then dissolving the ego by the recovery of unity realises itself as
the Lord, the One, and Birth as only a becoming of the Lord in mental and
formal being; this becoming is now governed by the true sight of the Seer
and, once this is done, becoming is no longer inconsistent with Being, birth
becomes a means and not an obstacle to the enjoyment of immortality by the
lord of this formal habitation.
\note{This is the stumbling-block to the ordinary philosophies which are
impregnated with the idea of the illusoriness of the world, even when they do
not go the whole way with the Mayavada. Birth, they would say, is a play of
ignorance, it cannot subsist along with entire knowledge.} This is our proper
course and not to remain for ever in the chain of birth and death, nor to flee
from birth into a pure non-becoming. The bondage does not consist in the
physical act of becoming, but in the persistence of the ignorant sense of the
separate ego. The Mind creates the chain and not the body.
\par
\ht Works and Knowledge
\par 9. The opposition between works and knowledge exists as long as works
and knowledge are only of the egoistic mental character. Mental knowledge
is not true knowledge; true knowledge is that which is based on the true sight,
the sight of the Seer, of Surya, of the Kavi. Mental thought is not knowledge,
it is a golden lid placed over the face of the Truth, the Sight, the divine
Ideation, the Truth-Consciousness. When that is removed, sight replaces
mental thought, the all-embracing truth-ideation, \NH{\it mahas}, \s{veda},
\s{d\,r\,s\,ti}, replaces the fragmentary mental activity. True Buddhi (\s{vij\~n\=ana})
emerges from the dissipated action of the Buddhi which is all that is possible
on the basis of the sense-mind, the Manas. Vijnana leads us to pure
knowledge (\s{j\~n\=ana}),
Page 96

pure consciousness (\s{cit}). There we realise our entire identity with the
Lord in all at the very roots of our being.
\par But in Chit, Will and Seeing are one. Therefore in Vijnana or
truth-ideation also which comes luminously out of Chit, Will and Sight are
combined and no longer as in the mind separated from each other. Therefore
when we have the sight and live in the Truth-Consciousness, our will
becomes the spontaneous law of the truth in us and, knowing all its acts and
their sense and objective, leads straight to the human goal, which was always
the enjoyment of the Ananda, the Lord's delight in self-being, the state of
Immortality. In our acts also we become one with all beings and our life
grows into a representation of oneness, truth and divine joy and no longer
proceeds on the crooked path of egoism full of division, error and stumbling.
In a word, we attain to the object of our existence which is to manifest in
itself whether on earth in a terrestrial body and against the resistance of
Matter or in the worlds beyond or enter beyond all world the glory of the
divine Life and the divine Being.

\ht The Subject of the Upanishad
\par\drop The twelve great Upanishads are written round one body of ancient
knowledge; but they approach it from different sides. Into the great kingdom
of the Brahmavidya each enters by its own gates, follows its own path or
detour, aims at its own point of arrival. The Isha Upanishad and the Kena are
both concerned with the same grand problem, the winning of the state of
Immortality, the relations of the divine, all-ruling, all-possessing Brahman to
the world and to the human consciousness, the means of passing out of our
present state of divided self, ignorance and suffering into the unity, the truth,
the divine beatitude. As the Isha closes with the aspiration towards the
supreme felicity, so the Kena closes with the definition of Brahman as the
Delight and the injunction to worship and seek after That as the Delight.
Nevertheless there is a variation in the starting-point, even in the standpoint, a
certain sensible divergence in the attitude.
\par For the precise subject of the two Upanishads is not identical. The Isha
is concerned with the whole problem of the world and life and works and
human destiny in their relation to the supreme truth of the Brahman. It
embraces in its brief eighteen verses most of the fundamental problems of
Life and scans them swiftly with the idea of the supreme Self and its
becomings, the supreme Lord and His workings as the key that shall unlock
all gates. The oneness of all existences is its dominating note.
\par The Kena Upanishad approaches a more restricted problem, starts with
a more precise and narrow inquiry. It concerns itself only with the relation of
mind-consciousness to Brahman-consciousness and does not stray outside
the strict boundaries of its subject. The material world and the physical life
are taken for granted, they are hardly mentioned. But the material world and
the physical life exist for us only by virtue of our internal self and our internal
life. According as our mental instruments represent to us the external world,
according as our vital force in obedience to the mind deals with its impacts
and objects, so
Page 111

will be our outward life and existence. The world is for us, not fundamentally
but practically at any rate, what our mind and senses declare it to be; life is
what our mentality or at least our half-mentalised vital being determines that
it shall become. The question is asked by the Upanishad, what then are these
mental instruments? what is this mental life which uses the external? Are
they the last witnesses, the supreme and final power? Are mind and life and
body all or is this human existence only a veil of something greater, mightier,
more remote and profound than itself?
\par The Upanishad replies that there is such a greater existence behind,
which is to the mind and its instruments, to the life-force and its workings
what they are to the material world. Matter does not know Mind, Mind
knows Matter; it is only when the creature embodied in Matter develops
mind, becomes the mental being that he can know his mental self and know
by that self Matter also in its reality to Mind. So also Mind does not know
That which is behind it, That knows Mind; and it is only when the being
involved in Mind can deliver out of its appearances his true Self that he can
become That, know it as himself and by it know also Mind in its reality to that
which is more real than Mind. How to rise beyond the mind and its
instruments, enter into himself, attain to the Brahman becomes then the
supreme aim for the mental being, the all-important problem of his existence.
\par For given that there is a more real existence than the mental existence, a
greater life than the physical life, it follows that the lower life with its forms
and enjoyments which are all that men here ordinarily worship and pursue,
can no longer be an object of desire for the awakened spirit. He must aspire
beyond; he must free himself from this world of death and mere phenomena
to become himself in his true state of immortality beyond them. Then alone
he really exists when here in this mortal life itself he can free himself from
the mortal consciousness and know and be the Immortal and Eternal.
Otherwise he feels that he has lost himself, has fallen from his true salvation.
\par But this Brahman-consciousness is not represented by the Upanishad as
something quite alien to the mental and physical
Page 112

world, aloof from it and in no way active upon it or concerned with its
activities. On the contrary, it is the Lord and ruler of all the world; the
energies of the gods in the mortal consciousness are its energies; when they
conquer and grow great, it is because Brahman has fought and won. This
world therefore is an inferior action, a superficial representation of something
infinitely greater, more perfect, more real than itself.
\par What is that something? It is the All-Bliss which is infinite being and
immortal force. It is that pure and utter bliss and not the desires and
enjoyments of this world which men ought to worship and to seek. How to
seek it is the one question that matters; to follow after it with all one's being is
the only truth and the only wisdom.

\ht The Question. {\it What Godhead?}
\par\drop Mind is the principal agent of the lower or phenomenal
consciousness; vital force or the life-breath, speech and the five senses of
knowledge are the instruments of the mind. Prana, the life-force in the
nervous system, is indeed the one main instrument of our mental
consciousness; for it is that by which the mind receives the contacts of the
physical world through the organs of knowledge, sight, hearing, smell, touch
and taste, and reacts upon its object by speech and the other four organs of
action; all these senses are dependent upon the nervous life-force for their
functioning. The Upanishad therefore begins by a query as to the final source
or control of the activities of the Mind, Life-Force, Speech, Senses.
\par The question is, \s{kena}, by whom or what? In the ancient conception
of the universe our material existence is formed from the five elemental
states of Matter, the ethereal, aerial, fiery, liquid and solid; everything that has
to do with our material existence is called the elemental, \s{adhibh\=uta}. In
this material there move non-material powers manifesting through the
Mind-Force and Life-Force that work upon Matter, and these are called
Gods or Devas; everything that has to do with the working of the
non-material in us is called \s{adhidaiva}, that which pertains to the Gods.
But above the non-material powers, containing them, greater than they is the
Self or Spirit, \s{\=atman}, and everything that has to do with this highest
existence in us is called the spiritual, \s{adhy\=atma}. For the purpose of the
Upanishads the \s{adhidaiva} is the subtle in us; it is that which is
represented by Mind and Life as opposed to gross Matter; for in Mind and
Life we have the characteristic action of the Gods.
\par The Upanishad is not concerned with the elemental, the \s{adhibh\=uta}; it
is concerned with the relation between the subtle existence and the spiritual,
the \s{adhidaiva} and \s{adhy\=atma}. But the Mind, the Life, the speech, the
senses are governed by cosmic powers, by Gods, by Indra, Vayu, Agni. Are
these subtle cosmic powers the beginning of existence, the true movers of
mind and life, or is
Page 114

there some superior unifying force, one in itself behind them all?
\par By whom or what is the mind missioned and sent on its errand so that it
falls on its object like an arrow shot by a skilful archer at its predetermined
mark, like a messenger, an envoy sent by his master to a fixed place for a
fixed object? What is it within us or without us that sends forth the mind on
its errand? What guides it to its object?
\par Then there is the life-force, the Prana, that works in our vital being and
nervous system. The Upanishad speaks of it as the first or supreme Breath;
elsewhere in the sacred writings it is spoken of as the chief Breath or the
Breath of the mouth, \s{mukhya}, \s{\=asanya}; it is that which carries in it the
Word, the creative expression. In the body of man there are said to be five
workings of the life-force called the five Pranas. One specially termed Prana
moves in the upper part of the body and is preeminently the breath of life,
because it brings the universal life-force into the physical system and gives it
there to be distributed. A second in the lower part of the trunk, termed
Apana, is the breath of death; for it gives away the vital force out of the
body. A third, the Samana, regulates the interchange of these two forces at
their meeting-place, equalises them and is the most important agent in
maintaining the equilibrium of the vital forces and their functions. A fourth,
the Vyana, pervasive, distributes the vital energies throughout the body. A
fifth, the Udana, moves upward from the body to the crown of the head and
is a regular channel of communication between the physical life and the
greater life of the spirit. None of these are the first or supreme Breath,
although the Prana most nearly represents it; the Breath to which so much
importance is given in the Upanishads, is the pure life-force itself,—first,
because all the others are secondary to it, born from it and only exist as its
special functions. It is imaged in the Veda as the Horse; its various energies
are the forces that draw the chariots of the Gods. The Vedic image is
recalled by the choice of the terms employed in the Upanishad, \s{yukta},
yoked, \s{praiti}, goes forward, as a horse driven by the charioteer advances
in its path.
\par Who then has yoked this life-force to the many workings of existence or
by what power superior to itself does it move
Page 115

forward in its paths? For it is not primal, self-existent or its own agent. We
are conscious of a power behind which guides, drives, controls, uses it.
\par The force of the vital breath enables us to bring up and speed outward
from the body this speech that we use to express, to throw out into a world of
action and new-creation the willings and thought-formations of the mind. It is
propelled by Vayu, the life-breath; it is formed by Agni, the secret will-force
and fiery shaping energy in the mind and body. But these are the agents.
Who or what is the secret Power that is behind them, the master of the word
that men speak, its real former and the origin of that which expresses itself?
\par The ear hears the sound, the eye sees the form; but hearing and vision
are particular operations of the life-force in us used by the mind in order to
put itself into communication with the world in which the mental being dwells
and to interpret it in the forms of sense. The life-force shapes them, the mind
uses them, but something other than the life-force and the mind enables them
to shape and to use their objects and their instruments. What God sets eye
and ear to their workings? Not Surya, the God of light, not Ether and his
regions; for these are only conditions of vision and hearing.
\par The Gods combine, each bringing his contribution, the operations of the
physical world that we observe as of the mental world that is our means of
observation; but the whole universal action is one, not a sum of fortuitous
atoms; it is one, arranged in its parts, combined in its multiple functionings by
virtue of a single conscient existence which can never be constructed or put
together (\s{ak\,rta}) but is for ever anterior to all these workings. The Gods
work only by this Power anterior to themselves, live only by its life, think only
by its thought, act only for its purposes. We look into ourselves and all things
and become aware of it there, an “I”, an “Is”, a Self, which is other, firmer,
vaster than any separate or individual being.
\par But since it is not anything that the mind can make its object or the
senses throw into form for the mind, what then is it—or who? What absolute
Spirit? What one, supreme and eternal Godhead? \s{Ko deva\,h}.

\par
\ht The Supramental Godhead
\par\drop The eternal question has been put which turns man's eyes away
from the visible and the outward to that which is utterly within, away from
the little known that he has become to the vast unknown he is behind these
surfaces and must yet grow into and be, because that is his Reality and out of
all masquerade of phenomenon and becoming the Real Being must eventually
deliver itself. The human soul once seized by this compelling direction can no
longer be satisfied with looking forth at mortalities and seemings through
those doors of the mind and sense which the Self-existent has made to open
outward upon a world of forms; it is driven to gaze inward into a new world
of realities.
\par Here in the world that man knows, he possesses something which,
however imperfect and insecure, he yet values. For he aims at and to some
extent he procures enlarged being, increasing knowledge, more and more joy
and satisfaction and these things are so precious to him that for what he can
get of them he is ready to pay the price of continual suffering from the shock
of their opposites. If then he has to abandon what he here pursues and
clasps, there must be a far more powerful attraction drawing him to the
Beyond, a secret offer of something so great as to be a full reward for all
possible renunciation that can be demanded of him here. This is offered,—not
an enlarged becoming, but infinite being; not always relative piecings of
knowledge mistaken in their hour for the whole of knowledge, but the
possession of our essential consciousness and the flood of its luminous
realities; not partial satisfactions, but {\it the} delight. In a word, Immortality.
\par The language of the Upanishad makes it strikingly clear that it is no
metaphysical abstraction, no void Silence, no indeterminate Absolute which is
offered to the soul that aspires, but rather the absolute of all that is possessed
by it here in the relative world of its sojourning. All here in the mental is a
growing light, consciousness and life; all there in the supramental is an
Page 117

infinite life, light and consciousness. That which is here shadowed, is there
found; the incomplete here is there the fulfilled. The Beyond is not an
annullation, but a transfiguration of all that we are here in our world of forms;
it is sovran Mind of this mind, secret Life of this life, the absolute Sense
which supports and justifies our limited senses.
\par We renounce ourselves in order to find ourselves; for in the mental life
there is only a seeking, but never an ultimate finding till mind is overpassed.
Therefore there is behind all our mentality a perfection of ourselves which
appears to us as an antinomy and contrast to what we are. For here we are a
constant becoming; there we possess our eternal being. Here we conceive of
ourselves as a changeful consciousness developed and always developing by
a hampered effort in the drive of Time; there we are an immutable
consciousness of which Time is not the master but the instrument as well as
the field of all that it creates and watches. Here we live in an organisation of
mortal consciousness which takes the form of a transient world; there we are
liberated into the harmonies of an infinite self-seeing which knows all world in
the light of the eternal and immortal. The Beyond is our reality; that is our
plenitude; that is the absolute satisfaction of our self-existence. It is
immortality and it is “That Delight”.
\par Here in our imprisoned mentality the ego strives to be master and
possessor of its inner field and its outer environment, yet cannot hold anything
to enjoy it, because it is not possible really to possess what is not-self to us.
But there in the freedom of the eternal our self-existence possesses without
strife by the sufficient fact that all things are itself. Here is the apparent man,
there the real man, the Purusha: here are gods, there is the Divine: here is the
attempt to exist, Life flowering out of an all-devouring death, there Existence
itself and a dateless immortality.
\par The answer that is thus given is involved in the very form of the original
question. The Truth behind Mind, Life, Sense must be that which controls by
exceeding it; it is the Lord, the all-possessing Deva. This was the conclusion
at which the Isha Upanishad arrived by the synthesis of all existences; the
Kena arrives at it by the antithesis of one governing self-existence
Page 118

to all this that exists variously by another power of being than its own. Each
follows its own method for the resolution of all things into the one Reality, but
the conclusion is identical. It is the All-possessing and All-enjoying, who is
reached by the renunciation of separate being, separate possession and
separate delight.
\par But the Isha addresses itself to the awakened seeker; it begins therefore
with the all-inhabiting Lord, proceeds to the all-becoming Self and returns to
the Lord as the Self of the cosmic movement, because it has to justify works
to the seeker of the Uncreated and to institute a divine life founded on the joy
of immortality and on the unified consciousness of the individual made one
with the universal. The Kena addresses itself to the soul still attracted by the
external life, not yet wholly awakened nor wholly a seeker; it begins
therefore with the Brahman as the Self beyond Mind and proceeds to the
Brahman as the hidden Lord of all our mental and vital activities, because it
has to point this soul upward beyond its apparent and outward existence. But
the two opening chapters of the Kena only state less widely from this other
viewpoint the Isha's doctrine of the Self and its becomings; the last two
repeat in other terms of thought the Isha's doctrine of the Lord and His
movement.

\ht The Eternal Beyond the Mind
\par\drop The Upanishad first affirms the existence of this profounder, vaster,
more puissant consciousness behind our mental being. That, it affirms, is
Brahman. Mind, Life, Sense, Speech are not the utter Brahman; they are
only inferior modes and external instruments. Brahman-consciousness is our
real self and our true existence.
\par Mind and body are not our real self; they are mutable formations or
images which we go on constructing in the drive of Time as a result of the
mass of our past energies. For although those energies seem to us to lie dead
in the past because their history is behind us, yet are they still existent in their
mass and always active in the present and the future.
\par Neither is the ego-function our real self. Ego is only a faculty put
forward by the discriminative mind to centralise round itself the experiences
of the sense-mind and to serve as a sort of lynch-pin in the wheel which
keeps together the movement. It is no more than an instrument, although it is
true that so long as we are limited by our normal mentality, we are compelled
by the nature of that mentality and the purpose of the instrument to mistake
our ego-function for our very self.
\par Neither is it the memory that constitutes our real self. Memory is another
instrument, a selective instrument for the practical management of our
conscious activities. The ego-function uses it as a rest and support so as to
preserve the sense of continuity without which our mental and vital activities
could not be organised for a spacious enjoyment by the individual. But even
our mental self comprises and is influenced in its being by a host of things
which are not present to our memory, are subconscious and hardly grasped at
all by our surface existence. Memory is essential to the continuity of the
ego-sense, but it is not the constituent of the ego-sense, still less of the being.
\par Neither is moral personality our real self. It is only a changing formation,
a pliable mould framed and used by our subjective life in order to give some
appearance of fixity to the
Page 120

constantly mutable becoming which our mental limitations successfully tempt
us to call ourselves.
\par Neither is the totality of that mutable conscious becoming, although
enriched by all that subconsciously underlies it, our real self. What we
become is a fluent mass of life, a stream of experience pouring through time,
a flux of Nature upon the crest of which our mentality rides. What we are is
the eternal essence of that life, the immutable consciousness that bears the
experience, the immortal substance of Nature and mentality.
\par For behind all and dominating all that we become and experience, there
is something that originates, uses, determines, enjoys, yet is not changed by its
origination, not affected by its instruments, not determined by its
determinations, not worked upon by its enjoyings. What that is, we cannot
know unless we go behind the veil of our mental being which knows only
what is affected, what is determined, what is worked upon, what is changed.
The mind can only be aware of that as something which we indefinably are,
not as something which it definably knows. For the moment our mentality
tries to fix this something, it loses itself in the flux and the movement, grasps
at parts, functions, fictions, appearances which it uses as planks of safety in
the welter or tries to cut out a form from the infinite and say, “This is I.” In
the words of the Veda, “when the mind approaches That and studies it, That
vanishes.”
\par But behind the Mind is this other or Brahman-conscious-ness, Mind of
our mind, Sense of our senses, Speech of our speech, Life of our life.
Arriving at that, we arrive at Self; we can draw back from mind the image
into Brahman the Reality.
\par But what differentiates that real from this apparent self? Or—since we
can say no more than we have said already in the way of definition, since we
can only indicate that “That” is not what “this” is, but is the mentally
inexpressible absolute of all that is here,—what is the relation of this
phenomenon to that reality? For it is the question of the relation that the \NH
Upanishad makes its starting-point; its opening question assumes that there is
a relation and that the reality originates and governs the phenomenon.
\par Obviously, Brahman is not a thing subject to our mind,
Page 121

senses, speech or life-force; it is no object seen, heard, expressed, sensed,
formed by thought, nor any state of body or mind that we become in the
changing movement of the life. But the thought of the Upanishad attempts to
awaken deeper echoes from our gulfs than this obvious denial of the mental
and sensuous objectivity of the Brahman. It affirms that not only is it not an
object of mind or a formation of life, but it is not even dependent on our mind,
life and senses for the exercise of its lordship and activity. It is that which
does not think by the mind, does not live by the life, does not sense by the
senses, does not find expression in the speech, but rather makes these things
themselves the object of its superior, all-comprehending, all-knowing
consciousness.
\par Brahman thinks out the mind by that which is beyond mind; it sees the
sight and hears the hearing by that absolute vision and audition which are not
phenomenal and instrumental but direct and inherent; it forms our expressive
speech out of its creative word; it speeds out this life we cling to from that
eternal movement of its energy which is not parceled out into forms but has
always the freedom of its own inexhaustible infinity.
\par Thus the Upanishad begins its reply to its own question. It first describes
Brahman as Mind of the mind, Sight of the sight, Hearing of the hearing,
Speech of the speech, Life of the life. It then takes up each of these
expressions and throws them successively into a more expanded form so as
to suggest a more definite and ample idea of their meaning, so far as that can
be done by words. To the expression “Mind of the mind” corresponds the
expanded phrase “That which thinks not with the mind, that by which the
mind is thought” and so on with each of the original descriptive expressions to
the closing definition of the Life behind this life as “That which breathes not
with the life-breath, that by which the life-power is brought forward into its
movement”.
\par And each of these exegetic lines is emphasised by the reiterated
admonition, “That Brahman seek to know and not this which men follow after
here.” Neither Mind, Life, Sense and Speech nor their objects and
expressions are the Reality which we have to know and pursue. True
knowledge is of That which forms
Page 122

these instruments for us but is itself independent of their utilities. True
possession and enjoyment is of that which, while it creates these objects of
our pursuit, itself makes nothing the object of its pursuit and passion, but is
eternally satisfied with all things in the joy of its immortal being.

\ht The Supreme Word
\par\drop The Upanishad, reversing the usual order of our logical thought
which would put Mind and Sense first or Life first and Speech last as a
subordinate function, begins its negative description of Brahman with an
explanation of the very striking phrase, Speech of our speech. And we can
see that it means a Speech beyond ours, an absolute expression of which
human language is only a shadow and as if an artificial counterfeit. What idea
underlies this phrase of the Upanishad and this precedence given to the
faculty of speech?
\par Continually, in studying the Upanishads, we have to divest ourselves of
modern notions and to realise as closely as possible the associations that lay
behind the early Vedantic use of words. We must recollect that in the Vedic
system the Word was the creatrix; by the Word Brahma creates the forms of
the universe. Moreover, human speech at its highest merely attempts to
recover by revelation and inspiration an absolute expression of Truth which
already exists in the Infinite above our mental comprehension. Equally, then,
must that Word be above our power of mental construction.
\par All creation is expression by the Word; but the form which is expressed
is only a symbol or representation of the thing which is. We see this in human
speech which only presents to the mind a mental form of the object; but the
object it seeks to express is itself only a form or presentation of another
Reality. That Reality is Brahman. Brahman expresses by the Word a form or
presentation of himself in the objects of sense and consciousness which
constitute the universe, just as the human word expresses a mental image of
those objects. That Word is creative in a deeper and more original sense than
human speech and with a power of which the utmost creativeness of human
speech can be only a far-off and feeble analogy.
\par The word used here for utterance means literally a raising up to confront
the mind. Brahman, says the Upanishad, is that which cannot be so raised up
before the mind by speech.
Page 124

\par Human speech, as we see, raises up only the presentation of a
presentation, the mental figure of an object which is itself only a figure of the
sole Reality, Brahman. It has indeed a power of new creation, but even that
power only extends to the creation of new mental images, that is to say, of
adaptive formations based upon previous mental images. Such a limited
power gives no idea of the original creative puissance which the old thinkers
attributed to the divine Word.
\par If, however, we go a little deeper below the surface, we shall arrive at a
power in human speech which does give us a remote image of the original
creative Word. We know that vibration of sound has the power to
create—and to destroy—forms; this is a commonplace of modern Science.
Let us suppose that behind all forms there has been a creative vibration of
sound.
\par Next, let us examine the relation of human speech to sound in general.
We see at once that speech is only a particular application of the principle of
sound, a vibration made by pressure of the breath in its passage through the
throat and mouth. At first, beyond doubt, it must have been formed naturally
and spontaneously to express the sensations and emotions created by an
object or occurrence and only afterwards seized upon by the mind to express
first the idea of the object and then ideas about the object. The value of
speech would therefore seem to be only representative and not creative.
\par But, in fact, speech is creative. It creates forms of emotion, mental
images and impulses of action. The ancient Vedic theory and practice
extended this creative action of speech by the use of the Mantra. The theory
of the Mantra is that it is a word of power born out of the secret depths of
our being where it has been brooded upon by a deeper consciousness than
the mental, framed in the heart and not originally constructed by the intellect,
held in the mind, again concentrated on by the waking mental consciousness
and then thrown out silently or vocally—the silent word is perhaps held to be
more potent than the spoken—precisely for the work of creation. The
Mantra can not only create new subjective states in ourselves, alter our
psychical being, reveal knowledge and faculties we did not before possess,
can not only produce similar results in other minds than that of the user, but
can
Page 125

produce vibrations in the mental and vital atmosphere which result in effects,
in actions and even in the production of material forms on the physical plane.
\par As a matter of fact, even ordinarily, even daily and hourly we do
produce by the word within us thought-vibrations, thought-forms which result
in corresponding vital and physical vibrations, act upon ourselves, act upon
others, and end in the indirect creation of actions and of forms in the physical
world. Man is constantly acting upon man both by the silent and the spoken
word and he so acts and creates, though less directly and powerfully, even in
the rest of Nature. But because we are stupidly engrossed with the external
forms and phenomena of the world and do not trouble to examine its subtle
and non-physical processes, we remain ignorant of all this field of science
behind.
\par The Vedic use of the Mantra is only a conscious utilisation of this secret
power of the word. And if we take the theory that underlies it together with
our previous hypothesis of a creative vibration of sound behind every
formation, we shall begin to understand the idea of the original creative
Word. Let us suppose a conscious use of the vibrations of sound which will
produce corresponding forms or changes of form. But Matter is only, in the
ancient view, the lowest of the planes of existence. Let us realise then that a
vibration of sound on the material plane presupposes a corresponding
vibration on the vital without which it could not have come into play; that
again presupposes a corresponding originative vibration on the mental; the
mental presupposes a corresponding originative vibration on the supramental
at the very root of things. But a mental vibration implies thought and
perception and a supramental vibration implies a supreme vision and
discernment. All vibration of sound on that higher plane is, then, instinct with
and expressive of this supreme discernment of a truth in things and is at the
same time creative, instinct with a supreme power which casts into forms the
truth discerned and eventually, descending from plane to plane, reproduces it
in the physical form or object created in Matter by etheric sound. Thus we
see that the theory of creation by the Word which is the absolute expression
of the Truth, and the theory of the material creation by sound-vibration in the
ether
Page 126

correspond and are two logical poles of the same idea. They both belong to
the same ancient Vedic system.
\par This, then, is the supreme Word, Speech of our speech. It is vibration of
pure Existence, instinct with the perceptive and originative power of infinite
and omnipotent consciousness, shaped by the Mind behind mind into the
inevitable word of the Truth of things; out of whatever substance on
whatever plane, the form or physical expression emerges by its creative
agency. The Supermind using the Word is the creative Logos.
\par The Word has its seed-sounds—suggesting the eternal syllable of the
Veda, A M, and the seed-sounds of the Tantriks—which carry in them the
principles of things; it has its forms which stand behind the revelatory and
inspired speech that comes to man's supreme faculties, and these compel the
forms of things in the universe; it has its rhythms,—for it is no disordered
vibration, but moves out into great cosmic measures,—and according to the
rhythm is the law, arrangement, harmony, processes of the world it builds.
Life itself is a rhythm of God.
\par But what is it that is expressed or raised up before the mental
consciousness by the Word in the phenomenal world? Not Brahman, but
truths, forms and phenomena of Brahman. Brahman is not, cannot be
expressed by the Word; he does not use the word here to express his very
self, but is known only to his own self-awareness. And even the truths of
himself that stand behind the forms of cosmic things are in their true reality
always self-expressed to his eternal vision in a higher than the mental
vibration, a rhythm and voice of themselves that is their own very soul of
movement. Speech, a lesser thing, creates, expresses, but is itself only a
creation and expression. Brahman is not expressed by speech, but speech is
itself expressed by Brahman. And that which expresses speech in us, brings
it up out of our consciousness with its strivings to raise up the truth of things
to our mind, is Brahman himself as the Word, a Thing that is in the supreme
superconscience. That Word, Speech of our speech, is in its essence of
Power the Eternal himself and in its supreme movements a part of his very
form and everlasting spiritual body, \sforced{brahma\,no r\=upam}.
Page 127

\par Therefore it is not the happenings and phenomena of the world that we
have to accept finally as our object of pursuit, but That which brings out from
itself the Word by which they were thrown into form for our observation by
the consciousness and for our pursuit by the will. In other words, the supreme
Existence that has originated all.
\par Human speech is only a secondary expression and at its highest a
shadow of the divine Word, of the seed-sounds, the satisfying rhythms, the
revealing forms of sound that are the omniscient and omnipotent speech of
the eternal Thinker, Harmonist, Creator. The highest inspired speech to
which the human mind can attain, the word most unanalysably expressive of
supreme truth, the most puissant syllable or \s{mantra} can only be its far-off
representation.

\ht The Necessity of Supermind
\par\drop As the Upanishad asserts a speech behind this speech, which is the
expressive aspect of the Brahman-consciousness, so it asserts a Mind behind
this mind which is its cognitive aspect. And as we asked ourselves what
could be the rational basis for the theory of the divine Word superior to our
speech, so we have now to ask ourselves what can be the rational basis for
this theory of a cognitive faculty or principle superior to Mind. We may say
indeed that if we grant a divine Word creative of all things, we must also
grant a divine Mind cognitive of the Word and of all that it expresses. But this
is not a sufficient foundation; for the theory of the divine Word presents itself
only as a rational possibility. A cognition higher than Mind presents itself on
the other hand as a necessity which arises from the very nature of Mind
itself, a necessity from which we cannot logically escape.
\par In the ancient system which admitted the soul's survival of the body,
Mind was the man, in a very profound and radical sense of the phrase. It is
not only that the human being is the one reasoning animal upon earth, the
thinking race; he is essentially the mental being in a terrestrial body, the
\s{manu}. Quite apart from the existence of a soul or self one in all
creatures, the body is not even the phenomenal self of man; the physical life
also is not himself; both may be dissolved, man will persist. But if the mental
being also is dissolved, man as man ceases to be; for this is his centre and the
nodus of his organism.
\par On the contrary, according to the theory of a material evolution upheld
by modern Science, man is only Matter that has developed mind by an
increasing sensibility to the shocks of its environment; and Matter being the
basis of existence, there is nothing, except the physical elements, that can
survive the dissolution of the body. But this formula is at most the obverse
and inferior side of a much larger truth. Matter could not develop Mind if in
or behind the force that constitutes physical forms there were not already a
principle of Mind striving towards self-
Page 129

manifestation. The will to enlighten and consciously govern the life and the
form must have been already existent in that which appears to us inconscient;
it must have been there before mind was evolved. For, if there were no such
necessity of Mind in Matter, if the stuff of mentality were not there already
and the will to mentalise, Mind could not possibly have come into being out of
inconscient substance.
\par But in the mere chemical elements which go to constitute material forms
or in electricity or in any other purely physical factor, whatever unconscious
will or sensation they may be possessed by or possess, we can discover
nothing which could explain the emergence of conscious sensation, which
could constitute a will towards the evolution of thought or which could impose
the necessity of such an evolution on inconscient physical substance. It is not
then in the form of Matter itself, but in the Force which is at work in Matter,
that we must seek the origin of Mind. That Force must either be itself
conscient or contain the grain of mental consciousness inherent in its being
and therefore the potentiality and indeed the necessity of its emergence. This
imprisoned consciousness, though originally absorbed in the creation first of
forms and then of physical relations and reactions between physical forms,
must still have held in itself from the beginning, however long kept back and
suppressed, a will to the ultimate enlightenment of these relations by the
creation of corresponding conscious or mental values. Mind is then a
concealed necessity which the subconscient holds in itself from the
commencement of things; it is the thing that must emerge once the attractions
and repulsions of Matter begin to be established; it is the suppressed secret
and cause of the reactions of life in the metal, plant and animal.
\par If on the other hand we say that Mind in some such secret and
suppressed form is not already existent in Matter, we must then suppose that
it exists outside Matter and embraces it or enters into it. We must suppose a
mental plane of existence which presses upon the physical and tends to
possess it. In that case the mental being would be in its origin an entity which
is formed outside the material world; but it prepares in that world bodies
which become progressively more and more able to house and
Page 130

express Mind. We may image it forming, entering into and possessing the
body, breaking into it, as it were,—as the Purusha in the Aitareya Upanishad
is said to form the body and then to enter in by breaking open a door in
Matter. Man would in this view be a mental being incarnate in the living body
who at its dissolution leaves it with full possession of his mentality.
\par The two theories are far from being incompatible with each other; they
can be viewed as complements forming a single truth. For the involution of
Mind, its latency in the material Force of the physical universe and in all its
movements does not preclude the existence of a mental world beyond and
above the reign of the physical principle. In fact, the emergence of such a
latent Mind might well depend upon and would certainly profit by the aid and
pressure of forces from a supra-physical kingdom, a mental plane of
existence.
\par There are always two possible views of the universe. The one supposes,
with modern Science, Matter to be the beginning of things and studies
everything as an evolution from Matter; or, if not Matter, then, with the
Sankhya philosophy, an indeterminate inconscient active Force or Prakriti of
which even mind and reason are mechanical operations,—the conscious soul,
if any exists, being a quite different and, although conscient, yet inactive
entity. The other supposes the conscious soul, the Purusha, to be the material
as well as the cause of the universe and Prakriti to be only its Shakti or the
Force of its conscious being which operates upon itself as the material of
forms.
\note{For example, the Aitareya Upanishad which shows us the Atman or
Self using the Purusha as that in which all the operations of Nature are
formed.} The latter is the view of the Upanishads. Certainly, if we study the
material world only, excluding all evidence of other planes as a dream or a
hallucination, if we equally exclude all evidence of operations in mind which
exceed the material limitation and study only its ordinary equation with
Matter, we must necessarily accept the theory of Matter as the origin and as
the indispensable basis and continent. Otherwise, we shall be irresistibly led
towards the early Vedantic conclusions.
\par However this may be, even from the standpoint of the sole material
world Man in the substance of his manhood is a mind
Page 131

occupying and using the life of the body—a mind that is greater than the
Matter in which it has emerged. He is the highest present expression of the
will in the material universe; the Force that has built up the worlds, so far as
we are able to judge of its intention from its actual operations as we see them
in their present formula upon earth, arrives in him at the thing it was seeking
to express. It has brought out the hidden principle of Mind that now operates
consciously and intelligently on the life and the body. Man is the satisfaction
of the necessity which Nature bore secretly in her from the very
commencement of her works; he is the highest possible Name or Numen on
this planet; he is the realised terrestrial godhead.
\par But all this is true only if we assume that for Nature's terrestrial
activities Mind is the ultimate formula. In reality and when we study more
deeply the phenomena of consciousness, the facts of mentality, the secret
tendency, aspiration and necessity of man's own nature, we see that he
cannot be the highest term. He is the highest realised here and now; he is not
the highest realisable. As there is something below him, so there is something,
if even only a possibility, above. As physical Nature concealed a secret
beyond herself which in him she has released into creation, so he too
conceals a secret beyond himself which he in turn must deliver to the light.
That is his destiny.
\par This must necessarily be so because Mind too is not the first principle of
things and therefore cannot be their last possibility. As Matter contained Life
in itself, contained it as its own secret necessity and had to be delivered of
that birth, and as Life contained Mind in itself, contained it as its own secret
necessity and had to be delivered of the birth it held, so Mind too contains in
itself that which is beyond itself, contains it as its own secret necessity and
presses to be delivered, it also, of this supreme birth.
\par What is the rational necessity which forbids us to suppose Mind to be
Nature's last birth and compels us to posit something beyond it of which itself
is the indication? A consideration of the nature and working of mentality
supplies us with the answer. For mentality is composed of three principal
elements, thought, will and sensation. Sensation may be described as an
attempt
Page 132

of divided consciousness to seize upon its object and enjoy it, thought as its
attempt to seize upon the truth of the object and possess it, will as its attempt
to seize upon the potentiality of the object and use it. At least these three
things are such an attempt in their essentiality, in their instinct, in their
subconscious purpose. But obviously the attempt is imperfect in its conditions
and its success; its very terms indicate a barrier, a gulf, an incapacity. As
Life is limited and hampered by the conditions of its synthesis with Matter, so
Mind is limited and hampered by the conditions of its synthesis with Life in
Matter. Neither Matter nor Life has found anything proper to their own
formula which could help to conquer or sufficiently expand its limitations;
they have been compelled each to call in a new principle, Matter to call into
itself Life, Life to call into itself Mind. Mind also is not able to find anything
proper to its own formula which can conquer or sufficiently expand the
limitations imposed upon its workings; Mind also has to call in a new principle
beyond itself, freer than itself and more powerful.
\par In other words, Mind does not exhaust the possibilities of consciousness
and therefore cannot be its last and highest expression. Mind tries to arrive at
Truth and succeeds only in touching it imperfectly with a veil between; there
must be in the nature of things a faculty or principle which sees the Truth
unveiled, an eternal faculty of knowledge which corresponds to the eternal
fact of the Truth. There is, says the Veda, such a principle; it is the
Truth-Consciousness which sees the Truth directly and is in possession of it
spontaneously. Mind labours to effect the will in it and succeeds only in
accomplishing partially, with difficulty and insecurely the potentiality at which
it works; there must be a faculty or principle of conscious effective force
which corresponds to the unconscious automatic principle of self-fulfilment in
Nature, and this principle must be sought for in the form of consciousness
that exceeds Mind. Mind, finally, aspires to seize and enjoy the essential
delight-giving quality, the \s{rasa} of things, but it succeeds only in attaining
to it indirectly, holding it in an imperfect grasp and enjoying it externally and
fragmentarily; there must be a principle which can attain directly, hold rightly,
enjoy intimately and securely.
Page 133

There is, says the Veda, an eternal Bliss-consciousness which corresponds to
the eternal \s{rasa} or essential delight-giving quality of all experience and is
not limited by the insecure approximations of the sense in Mind.
\par If, then, such a deeper principle of consciousness exists, it must be that
and not mind which is the original and fundamental intention concealed in
Nature and which eventually and somewhere must emerge. But is there any
reason for supposing that it must emerge here and in Mind, as Mind has
emerged in Life and Life in Matter? We answer in the affirmative because
Mind has in itself, however obscurely, that tendency, that aspiration and, at
bottom, that necessity. There is one law from the lowest to the highest.
Matter, when we examine it closely, proves to be instinct with the stuff of
Life—the vibrations, actions and reactions, attractions and repulsions,
contractions and expansions, the tendencies of combination, formation and
growth, the seekings and responses which are the very substance of life; but
the visible principle of life can only emerge when the necessary material
conditions have been prepared which will permit it to organise itself in
Matter. So also Life is instinct with the stuff of Mind, abounds with an
unconscious
\note{I use the language of the materialist Haeckel in spite of its paradoxical
form.} sensation, will, intelligence, but the visible principle of Mind can only
emerge when the necessary vital conditions have been prepared which will
permit it to organise itself in living Matter. Mind too is instinct with the stuff
of supermind—sympathies, unities, intuitions, emergences of pre-existent
knowledge, instincts, imperative lights and movements, inherent
self-effectivities of will which disguise themselves in a mental form; but the
visible principle of supermind can only emerge when the necessary mental
conditions are prepared which will permit it to organise itself in man, the
mental living creature.
\par This necessary preparation is proceeding in human development as the
corresponding preparations were developed in the lower stages of the
evolution,—with the same gradations, retardations, inequalities; but still it is
more enlightened, increasingly self-conscious, nearer to a conscious sureness.
And the very fact that this progress is attended by less absorption in the
detail,
Page 134

less timidity of error, a less conservative attachment to the step gained
suggests as much as it contradicts the hope and almost the assurance that
when the new principle emerges it will not be by the creation of a new and
quite different type which, separated after its creation, will leave the rest of
mankind in the same position to it as are the animals to man, but, if not by the
elevation of humanity as a whole to a higher level, yet by an opening of the
greater possibility to all of the race who have the will to rise. For Man, first
among Nature's children, has shown the capacity to change himself by his
own effort and the conscious aspiration to transcend.
\par These considerations justify to the reason the idea of a Mind beyond our
mind, but only as a final evolution out of Matter. The Upanishad, however,
enthrones it as the already existing creator and ruler of Mind; it is a secret
principle already conscient and not merely contained inconsciently in the very
stuff of things. But this is the natural conclusion—even apart from spiritual
experience—from the nature of the supramental principle. For it is at its
highest an eternal knowledge, will, bliss and conscious being and it is more
reasonable to conclude that it is eternally conscious, though we are not
conscious of it, and the source of the universe, than that it is eternally
inconscient and only becomes conscient in Time as a result of the universe.
Our inconscience of it is no proof that it is inconscient of us: and yet our own
incapacity is the only real basis left for the denial of an eternal Mind beyond
mind superior to its creations and originative of the cosmos.
\par All other foundations for the rejection of this ancient wisdom have
disappeared or are disappearing before the increasing light of modern
knowledge.

\ht Mind and Supermind
\par\drop We arrive then at this affirmation of an all-cognitive principle
superior to Mind and exceeding it in nature, scope and capacity. For the
Upanishad affirms a Mind beyond mind as the result of intuition and spiritual
experience and its existence is equally a necessary conclusion from the facts
of the cosmic evolution. What then is this Mind beyond mind? how does it
function? or by what means shall we arrive at the knowledge of it or possess
it?
\par The Upanishad asserts about this supreme cognitive principle, first, that it
is beyond the reach of mind and the senses; secondly, that it does not itself
think with the mind; thirdly, that it is that by which mind itself is thought or
mentalised; fourthly, that it is the very nature or description of the
Brahman-consciousness.
\par When we say, however, that “Mind of mind” is the nature or description
of the Brahman-consciousness, we must not forget that the absolute
Brahman in itself is held to be unknowable and therefore beyond description.
It is unknowable, not because it is a void and capable of no description except
that of nothingness, nor because, although positive in existence, it has no
content or quality, but because it is beyond all things that our present
instruments of knowledge can conceive and because the methods of ideation
and expression proper to our mentality do not apply to it. It is the absolute of
all things that we know and of each thing that we know and yet nothing nor
any sum of things can exhaust or characterise its essential being. For its
manner of being is other than that which we call existence; its unity resists all
analysis, its multiple infinities exceed every synthesis. Therefore it is not in its
absolute essentiality that it can be described as Mind of the mind, but in its
fundamental nature in regard to our mental existence.
Brahman-consciousness is the eternal outlook of the Absolute upon the
relative.
\par But even of this outlook we may say that it is beyond the reach of mind
and speech and senses. Yet mind, speech and
Page 136

senses seem to be our only available means for acquiring and expressing
knowledge. Must we not say then that this Brahman-consciousness also is
unknowable and that we can never hope to know it or possess it while in this
body? Yet the Upanishad commands us to {\it know} this Brahman and by
knowledge to possess it—for the knowledge intended by the words
\s{viddhi}, \s{aved\=it}, is a knowledge that discovers and takes
possession,—and it declares later on that it is here, in this body and on this
earth that we must thus possess Brahman in knowledge, otherwise great is
the perdition. A good deal of confusion has been brought into the
interpretation of this Upanishad by a too trenchant dealing with the subtlety of
its distinctions between the knowability and the unknowability of the
Brahman. We must therefore try to observe exactly what the Upanishad
says and especially to seize the whole of its drift by synthetic intuition rather
than cut up its meaning so as to make it subject to our logical mentality.
\par The Upanishad sets out by saying that this Ruler of the mind, senses,
speech and life is Mind of our mind, Life of our life, Sense of our senses,
Speech of our speech; and it then proceeds to explain what it intends by
these challenging phrases. But it introduces between the description and the
explanation a warning that neither the description nor the explanation must be
pushed beyond their proper limits or understood as more than guide-posts
pointing us towards our goal. For neither Mind, Speech nor Sense can travel
to the Brahman; therefore Brahman must be beyond all these things in its
very nature, otherwise it would be attainable by them in their function. The
Upanishad, although it is about to teach of the Brahman, yet affirms, “we
know It not, we cannot distinguish how one should teach of it.” The two
Sanskrit words that are here used, \s{vidma\,h} and \s{vij\=an\=ima\,h}, seem to
indicate the one a general grasp and possession in knowledge, the other a
total and exact comprehension in whole and detail, by synthesis and analysis.
The reason of this entire inability is next given, “because Brahman is other
than the known and It is there over the unknown”, possessing it and, as it
were, presiding over it. The known is all that we grasp and possess by our
present mentality; it is all that is not the supreme Brahman but only form and
phenomenon of it to our sense and mental cognition. The

unknown is that which is beyond the known and though unknown is not
unknowable if we can enlarge our faculties or attain to others that we do not
yet possess.
\par Yet the Upanishad next proceeds to maintain and explain its first
description and to enjoin on us the knowledge of the Brahman which it so
describes. This contradiction is not at once reconciled; it is only in the second
chapter that the difficulty is solved and only in the fourth that the means of
knowledge are indicated. The contradiction arises from the nature of our
knowledge itself which is a relation between the consciousness that seeks
and the consciousness that is sought; where that relation disappears,
knowledge is replaced by sheer identity. In what we call existence, the
highest knowledge can be no more than the highest relation between that
which seeks and that which is sought, and it consists in a modified identity
through which we may pass beyond knowledge to the absolute identity. This
metaphysical distinction is of importance because it prevents us from
mistaking any relation in knowledge for the absolute and from becoming so
bound by our experience as to lose or miss the fundamental awareness of the
absolute which is beyond all possible description and behind all formulated
experience. But it does not render the highest relation in our knowledge, the
modified identity in experience worthless or otiose. On the contrary, it is that
we must aim at as the consummation of our existence in the world. For if we
possess it without being limited by it,—and if we are limited by it we have not
true possession of it,—then in and through it we shall, even while in this body,
remain in touch with the Absolute.
\par The means for the attainment of this highest knowledge is the constant
preparation of the mind by the admission into it of a working higher than itself
until the mind is capable of giving itself up to the supramental action which
exceeds it and which will finally replace it. In fact, Mind also has to follow
the law of natural progression which has governed our evolution in this world
from Matter into Life and Life into Mind. For just as Life-consciousness is
beyond the imprisoned material being and unattainable by it through its own
instruments, just as mind-consciousness is beyond the first inconscient
movements of life,
Page 138

so too this supramental consciousness is beyond the divided and dividing
nature of Mind and unattainable by it through its own instruments. But as
Matter is constantly prepared for the manifestation of Life until Life is able to
move in it, possess it, manage in it its own action and reaction, and as Life is
constantly prepared for the manifestation of Mind until Mind is able to use it,
enlighten its actions and reactions by higher and higher mental values, so
must it be with Mind and that which is beyond Mind.
\par And all this progression is possible because these things are only
different formations of one being and one consciousness. Life only reveals in
Matter that which is involved in Matter, that which is the secret meaning and
essence of Matter. It reveals, as it were, to material existence its own soul,
its own end. So too Mind reveals in Life all that Life means, all that it
obscurely is in essence but cannot realise because it is absorbed in its own
practical motion and its own characteristic form. So also Supermind must
intervene to reveal Mind to itself, to liberate it from its absorption in its own
practical motion and characteristic form and enable the mental being to
realise that which is the hidden secret of all its formal practice and action.
Thus shall man come to the knowledge of that which rules within him and
missions his mind to its mark, sends forth his speech, impels the life-force in
its paths and sets his senses to their workings.
\par This supreme cognitive Principle does not think by the mind. Mind is to it
an inferior and secondary action, not its own proper mode. For Mind, based
on limitation and division, can act only from a given centre in the lower and
obscured existence; but Supermind is founded on unity and it comprehends
and pervades; its action is in the universal and is in conscious communion
with a transcendent source eternal and beyond the formations of the
universe. Supermind regards the individual in the universal and does not begin
with him or make of him a separate being. It starts from the Transcendent
and sees the universal and individual as they are in relation to it, as its terms,
as its formulas; it does not start from the individual and universal to arrive at
the Transcendent. Mind acquires knowledge and mastery; it reaches it by a
constant mentalising and willing: Supermind possesses knowledge and
mastery; possessing, it throws
Page 139

itself out freely in various willing and knowing. Mind gropes by divided
sensation; it arrives at a sort of oneness through sympathy: Supermind
possesses by a free and all-embracing sense; it lives in the unity of which
various love and sympathy are only a secondary play of manifestation.
Supermind starts from the whole and sees in it its parts and properties, it does
not build up the knowledge of the whole by an increasing knowledge of the
parts and properties; and even the whole is to it only a unity of sum, only a
partial and inferior term of the higher unity of infinite essence.
\par We see, then, that these two cognitive Principles start from two opposite
poles and act in opposite directions by opposite methods. Yet it is by the
higher cognitive that the lower is formed and governed. Mind is thought by
that which is beyond Mind; the mentalising consciousness shapes and directs
its movement according to the knowledge and impulse it receives from this
higher Supermind and even the stuff of which it is formed belongs to that
Principle. Mentality exists because that which is beyond Mind has conceived
an inverse action of itself working in a thinner, poorer, darker, less powerful
substance of conscious being and founded upon its self-concentration on
different points in its own being and in different forms of its own being.
Supermind fixes these points, sees how consciousness must act from them on
other forms of itself and in obedience to the pressure of those other forms,
once a particular rhythm or law of universal action is given; it governs the
whole action of mentality according to what it thus fixes and sees. Even our
ignorance is only the distorted action of a truth projected from the Supermind
and could not exist except as such a distortion; and so likewise all our
dualities of knowledge, sensation, \NH emotion, force proceed from that
higher vision, obey it and are a secondary and, as one might say, perverse
action of the concealed Supermind itself which governs always this lower
action in harmony with its first conception of a located consciousness, divided
indeed and therefore not in possession of its world or itself, but feeling out
towards that possession and towards the unity which, because of the
Supermind in us, it instinctively, if obscurely, knows to be its true nature and
right.
Page 140

\par But, for this very reason, the feeling out, the attempt at acquisition can
only succeed in proportion as the mental being abandons his characteristic
mentality and its limitations in order to rise beyond to that Mind of the mind
which is his origin and his secret governing principle. His mentality must
admit Supramentality as Life has admitted Mind. So long as he worships,
follows after, adheres to all this that he now accepts as the object of his
pursuit, to the mind and its aims, to its broken methods, its constructions of
will and opinion and emotion dependent on egoism, division and ignorance, he
cannot rise beyond this death to that immortality which the Upanishad
promises to the seeker. That Brahman we have to know and seek after and
not this which men here adore and pursue.
\par
Page 141

\hn VIII
\par\drop The Upanishad is not satisfied with the definition of the
Brahman-consciousness as Mind of the mind. Just as it has described it as
Speech of the speech, so also it describes it as Eye of the eye, Ear of the ear.
Not only is it an absolute cognition behind the play of expression, but also an
absolute Sense behind the action of the senses. Every part of our being finds
its fulfilment in that which is beyond its present forms of functioning and not
in those forms themselves.
\par This conception of the all-governing supreme consciousness does not fall
in with our ordinary theories about sense and mind and the Brahman. We
know of sense only as an action of the organs through which embodied mind
communicates with external Matter, and these sense-organs have been
separately developed in the course of evolution; the senses therefore are not
fundamental things, but only subordinate conveniences and temporary
physical functionings of the embodied mind. Brahman, on the other hand, we
conceive of by the elimination of all that is not fundamental, by the elimination
even of the Mind itself. It is a sort of positive zero, an {\it X} or unknowable
which corresponds to no possible equation of physical or psychological
quantities. In essence this may or may not be true; but we have now to think
not of the Unknowable but of its highest manifestation in consciousness; and
this we have described as the outlook of the Absolute on the relative and as
that which is the cause and governing power of all that we and the universe
are. There in that governing cause there must be something essential and
supreme of which all our fundamental functionings here are a rendering in the
terms of embodied consciousness.
\par Sense, however, is not or does not appear to be fundamental; it is only an
instrumentation of Mind using the nervous system. It is not even a pure
mental functioning, but depends so much upon the currents of the Life-force,
upon its electric energy vibrating up and down the nerves, that in the
Upanishads the senses are called Pranas, powers or functionings of the
Life-force. It is
Page 142

true that Mind turns these nervous impressions when communicated to it into
mental values, but the sense-action itself seems to be rather nervous than
mental. In any case there would, at first sight, appear to be no warrant in
reason for attributing a Sense of the sense to that which is not embodied, to a
supramental consciousness which has no need of any such instrumentation.
\par But this is not the last word about sense; this is only its outward
appearance behind which we must penetrate. What, not in its functioning, but
in its essence, is the thing we call sense? In its functioning, if we analyse that
thoroughly, we see that it is the contact of the mind with an eidolon of
Matter,—whether that eidolon be of a vibration of sound, a light-image of
form, a volley of earth-particles giving the sense of odour, an impression of
\s{rasa} or sap that gives the sense of taste, or that direct sense of
disturbance of our nervous being which we call touch. No doubt, the contact
of Matter with Matter is the original cause of these sensations; but it is only
the eidolon of Matter, as for instance the image of the form cast upon the
eye, with which the mind is directly concerned. For the mind operates upon
Matter not directly, but through the Life-force; that is its instrument of
communication and the Life-force, being in us a nervous energy and not
anything material, can seize on Matter only through nervous impressions of
form, through contactual images, as it were, which create corresponding
values in the energy-consciousness called in the Upanishads the Prana. Mind
takes these up and replies to them with corresponding mental values, mental
impressions of form, so that the thing sensed comes to us after a triple
process of translation, first the material eidolon, secondly the nervous or
energy-image, third the image reproduced in stuff of mind.
\par This elaborate process is concealed from us by the lightning-like rapidity
with which it is managed,—rapidity in our \NH impressions of Time; for in
another notation of Time by a creature differently constituted each part of the
operation might be distinctly sensible. But the triple translation is always
there, because there are really three sheaths of consciousness in us, the
material, \sforced{annako\,sa}, in which the physical contact and image are
received and formed, the vital and nervous, \sforced{pr\=a\,nako\,sa}, in which
there is a nervous contact and formation, the mental, \sforced{mana\,hko\,sa},
in which
Page 143

there is mental contact and imaging. We dwell centred in the mental sheath
and therefore the experience of the material world has to come through the
other two sheaths before it can reach us.
\par The foundation of sense, therefore, is contact, and the essential contact
is the mental without which there would not be sense at all. The plant, for
instance, feels nervously, feels in terms of life-energy, precisely as the human
nervous system does, and it has precisely the same reactions; but it is only if
the plant has rudimentary mind that we can suppose it to be, as we
understand the word, sensible of these nervous or vital impressions and
reactions. For then it would feel not only nervously, but in terms of mind.
Sense, then, may be described as in its essence mental contact with an object
and the mental reproduction of its image.
\par All these things we observe and reason of in terms of this embodiment
of mind in Matter; for these sheaths or \sforced{ko\,sas} are formations in a
more and more subtle substance reposing on gross Matter as their base. Let
us imagine that there is a mental world in which Mind and not Matter is the
base. There sense would be quite a different thing in its operation. It would
feel mentally an image in Mind and throw it out into form in more and more
gross substance; and whatever physical formations there might already be in
that world would respond rapidly to the Mind and obey its modifying
suggestions. Mind would be masterful, creative, originative, not as with us
either obedient to Matter and merely reproductive or else in struggle with it
and only with difficulty able to modify a material predetermined and dully
reluctant to its touch. It would be, subject to whatever supramental power
might be above it, master of a ductile and easily responsive material. But still
Sense would be there, because contact in mental consciousness and
formation of images would still be part of the law of being.
\par Mind, in fact, or active consciousness generally has four necessary
functions which are indispensable to it wherever and however it may act and
of which the Upanishads speak in the four terms, \s{vij\~n\=ana}, \s{praj\~n\=ana},
\sforced{sa\.mj\~n\=ana} and \s{\=aj\~n\=ana}. Vijnana is the original comprehensive
consciousness which holds an image of things at once in its essence, its
totality and its parts and
Page 144

properties; it is the original, spontaneous, true and complete view of it which
belongs properly to the supermind and of which mind has only a shadow in
the highest operations of the comprehensive intellect. Prajnana is the
consciousness which holds an image of things before it as an object with
which it has to enter into relations and to possess by apprehension and a
combined analytic and synthetic cognition. Sanjnana is the contact of
consciousness with an image of things by which there is a sensible possession
of it in its substance; if prajnana can be described as the outgoing of
apprehensive consciousness to possess its object in conscious energy, to
know it, sanjnana can be described as the inbringing movement of
apprehensive consciousness which draws the object placed before it back to
itself so as to possess it in conscious substance, to feel it. Ajnana is the
operation by which consciousness dwells on an image of things so as to hold,
govern and possess it in power. These four, therefore, are the basis of all
conscious action.
\par As our human psychology is constituted, we begin with sanjnana, the
sense of an object in its image; the apprehension of it in knowledge follows.
Afterwards we try to arrive at the comprehension of it in knowledge and the
possession of it in power. There are secret operations in us, in our
subconscient and superconscient selves, which precede this action, but of
these we are not aware in our surface being and therefore for us they do not
exist. If we knew of them, our whole conscious functioning would be
changed. As it is what happens is a rapid process by which we sense an
image and have of it an apprehensive percept and concept, and a slower
process of the intellect by which we try to comprehend and possess it. The
former process is the natural action of the mind which has entirely developed
in us; the latter is an acquired action, an action of the intellect and the
intelligent will which represent in Mind an attempt of the mental being to do
what can only be done with perfect spontaneity and mastery by something
higher than Mind. The intellect and intelligent will form a bridge by which the
mental being is trying to establish a conscious connection with the
supramental and to prepare the embodied soul for the descent into it of a
supramental action. Therefore the first process is comparatively easy,
spontaneous,
Page 145

rapid, perfect; the second slow, laboured, imperfect. In proportion as the
intellectual action becomes associated with and dominated by a rudimentary
supramental action,—and it is this which constitutes the phenomenon of
genius,—the second process also becomes more and more easy,
spontaneous, rapid and perfect.
\par If we suppose a supreme consciousness, master of the world, which
really conducts behind the veil all the operations the mental gods attribute to
themselves, it will be obvious that that consciousness will be the entire
Knower and Lord. The basis of its action or government of the world will be
the perfect, original and all-possessing vijnana and ajnana. It will comprehend
all things in its energy of conscious knowledge, control all things in its energy
of conscious power. These energies will be the spontaneous inherent action
of its conscious being creative and possessive of the forms of the universe.
What part then will be left for the apprehensive consciousness and the
sense? They will be not independent functions, but subordinate operations
involved in the action of the comprehensive consciousness itself. In fact, all
four there will be one rapid movement. If we had all these four acting in us
with the unified rapidity with which the prajnana and sanjnana act, we should
then have in our notation of Time some inadequate image of the unity of the
supreme action of the supreme energy.
\par If we consider, we shall see that this must be so. The supreme
consciousness must not only comprehend and possess in its conscious being
the images of things which it creates as its self-expression, but it must place
them before it—always in its own being, not externally—and have a certain
relation with them by the two terms of apprehensive consciousness.
Otherwise the universe would not take the form that it has for us; for we only
reflect in the terms of our organisation the movements of the supreme
Energy. But by the very fact that the images of things are there held in front
of an apprehending consciousness within the comprehending conscious being
and not externalised as our individual mind externalises them, the supreme
Mind and supreme Sense will be something quite different from our mentality
and our forms of sensation. They will be terms of an
Page 146

entire knowledge and self-possession and not terms of an ignorance and
limitation which strives to know and possess.
\par In its essential and general term our sense must reflect and be the
creation of this supreme Sense. But the Upanishad speaks of a Sight behind
our sight and a Hearing behind our hearing, not in general terms of a Sense
behind our sense. Certainly eye and ear are only taken as typical of the
senses, and are chosen because they are the highest and subtlest of them all.
But still the differentiation of sense which forms part of our mentality is
evidently held to correspond with a differentiation of some kind in the
supreme Sense. How is this possible? It is what we have next to unravel by
examining the nature and source of the functioning of the separate senses in
ourselves,—their source in our mentality and not merely their functioning in
the actual terms of our life-energy and our body. What is it in Mind that is
fundamental to sight and hearing? Why do we see and hear and not simply
sense with the mind?
Page 147

\hn IX
\par\drop Mind was called by Indian psychologists the eleventh and ranks as
the supreme sense. In the ancient arrangement of the senses, five of
knowledge and five of action, it was the sixth of the organs of knowledge and
at the same time the sixth of the organs of action. It is a commonplace of
psychology that the effective functioning of the senses of knowledge is
inoperative without the assistance of the mind; the eye may see, the ear may
hear, all the senses may act, but if the mind pays no attention, the man has
not heard, seen, felt, touched or tasted. Similarly, according to psychology, the
organs of action act only by the force of the mind operating as will or,
physiologically, by the reactive nervous force from the brain which must be
according to materialistic notions the true self and essence of all will. In any
case, the senses or all senses, if there are other than the ten,—according to a
text in the Upanishad there should be at least fourteen, seven and seven,—all
senses appear to be only organisations, functionings, instrumentations of the
mind-consciousness, devices which it has formed in the course of its
evolution in living Matter.
\par Modern psychology has extended our knowledge and has admitted us to
a truth which the ancients already knew but expressed in other language. We
know now or we rediscover the truth that the conscious operation of mind is
only a surface action. There is a much vaster and more potent subconscious
mind which loses nothing of what the senses bring to it; it keeps all its wealth
in an inexhaustible store of memory, \sforced{ak\,sitam} \s{\'srava\,h}. The
surface mind may pay no attention, still the subconscious mind attends,
receives, treasures up with an infallible accuracy. The illiterate servant-girl
hears daily her master reciting Hebrew in his study; the surface mind pays no
attention to the unintelligible gibberish, but the subconscious mind hears,
remembers and, when in an abnormal condition it comes up to the surface,
reproduces those learned recitations with a portentous accuracy which the
most correct and retentive scholar might
Page 148

envy. The man or mind has not heard because he did not attend; the greater
man or mind within has heard because he always attends, or rather
sub-tends, with an infinite capacity. So too a man put under an anaesthetic
and operated upon has felt nothing; but release his subconscious mind by
hypnosis and he will relate accurately every detail of the operation and its
appropriate sufferings; for the stupor of the physical sense-organ could not
prevent the larger mind within from observing and feeling.
\par Similarly we know that a large part of our physical action is instinctive
and directed not by the surface but by the subconscious mind. And we know
now that it is a mind that acts and not merely an ignorant nervous reaction
from the brute physical brain. The subconscious mind in the catering insect
knows the anatomy of the victim it intends to immobilise and make food for
its young and it directs the sting accordingly, as unerringly as the most skilful
surgeon, provided the mere limited surface mind with its groping and faltering
nervous action does not get in the way and falsify the inner knowledge or the
inner will-force.
\par These examples point us to truths which western psychology, hampered
by past ignorance posing as scientific orthodoxy, still ignores or refuses to
acknowledge. The Upanishads declare that the Mind in us is infinite; it knows
not only what has been seen but what has not been seen, not only what has
been heard but what has not been heard, not only what has been
discriminated by the thought but what has not been discriminated by the
thought. Let us say, then, in the tongue of our modern knowledge that the
surface man in us is limited by his physical experiences; he knows only what
his nervous life in the body brings to his embodied mind; and even of those
bringings he knows, he can retain and utilise only so much as his surface
mind-sense attends to and consciously remembers; but there is a larger
subliminal consciousness within him which is not thus limited. That
consciousness senses what has not been sensed by the surface mind and its
organs and knows what the surface mind has not learned by its acquisitive
thought. That in the insect knows the anatomy of its victim; that in the man
outwardly insensible not only feels and remembers the action of the surgeon's
knife, but knows the appropriate reactions of suffering which were in the
Page 149

physical body inhibited by the anaesthetic and therefore non-existent; that in
the illiterate servant-girl heard and retained accurately the words of an
unknown language and could, as Yogic experience knows, by a higher action
of itself understand those superficially unintelligible sounds.
\par To return to the Vedantic words we have been using, there is a vaster
action of the Sanjnana which is not limited by the action of the physical
sense-organs; it was this which sensed perfectly and made its own through
the ear the words of the unknown language, through the touch the
movements of the unfelt surgeon's knife, through the sense-mind or sixth
sense the exact location of the centres of locomotion in the victim insect.
There is also associated with it a corresponding vaster action of Prajnana,
Ajnana and Vijnana not limited by the smaller apprehensive and
comprehensive faculties of the external mind. It is this vaster Prajnana which
perceived the proper relation of the words to each other, of the movement of
the knife to the unfelt suffering of the nerves and of the successive relation in
space of the articulations in the insect's body. Such perception was inherent
in the right reproduction of the words, the right narration of the sufferings, the
right successive action of the sting. The Ajnana or Knowledge-Will
originating all these actions was also vaster, not limited by the faltering force
that governs the operations directed by the surface mind. And although in
these examples the action of the vaster Vijnana is not so apparent, yet it was
evidently there working through them and ensuring their co-ordination.
\par But at present it is with the Sanjnana that we are concerned. Here we
should note, first of all, that there is an action of the sense-mind which is
superior to the particular action of the senses and is aware of things even
without imaging them in forms of sight, sound, contact, but which also as a
sort of subordinate operation, subordinate but necessary to completeness of
presentation, does image in these forms. This is evident in psychical
phenomena. Those who have carried the study and experimentation of them
to a certain extent, have found that we can sense things known only to the
minds of others, things that exist only at a great distance, things that belong to
another plane than the terrestrial but have here their effects; we can both
sense them in
Page 150

their images and also feel, as it were, all that they are without any definite
image proper to the five senses.
\par This shows, in the first place, that sight and the other senses are not
mere results of the development of our physical organs in the terrestrial
evolution. Mind, subconscious in all Matter and evolving in Matter, has
developed these physical organs in order to apply its inherent capacities of
sight, hearing etc., on the physical plane by physical means for a physical life;
but they are inherent capacities and not dependent on the circumstance of
terrestrial evolution and they can be employed without the use of the physical
eye, ear, skin, palate. Supposing that there are psychical senses which act
through a psychical body, and we thus explain these psychical phenomena,
still that action also is only an organisation of the inherent functioning of the
essential sense, the Sanjnana, which in itself can operate without bodily
organs. This essential sense is the original capacity of consciousness to feel
in itself all that consciousness has formed and to feel it in all the essential
properties and operations of that which has form, whether represented
materially by vibration of sound or images of light or any other physical
symbol.
\par The trend of knowledge leads more and more to the conclusion that not
only are the properties of form, even the most obvious such as colour, light
etc., merely operations of Force, but form itself is only an operation of Force.
This Force again proves to be self-power of conscious-being
\note{\s{Dev\=atma\'sakti\.m svagu\,nair nig\=u\,dh\=am}, self-power of the divine
Existent hidden by its own modes. Shwetashwatara Upanishad.} in a state of
energy and activity. Practically, therefore, all form is only an operation of
consciousness impressing itself with presentations of its own workings. We
see colour because that is the presentation which consciousness makes to
itself of one of its own operations; but colour is only an operation of Force
working in the form of Light, and Light again is only a movement, that is to
say an operation of Force. The question is what is essential to this operation
of Force taking on itself the presentation of form? For it is this that must
determine the working of Sanjnana or Sense on whatever plane it may
operate.
\par Everything begins with vibration or movement, the
Page 151

original \sforced{k\,sobha} or disturbance. If there is no movement of the
conscious being, it can only know its own pure static existence. Without
vibration
\note{The term is used not because it is entirely adequate or accurate, no
physical term can be, but because it is most suggestive of the original
outgoing of consciousness to seek itself.} or movement of being in
consciousness there can be no act of knowledge and therefore no sense;
without vibration or movement of being in force there can be no object of
sense. Movement of conscious being as knowledge becoming sensible of
itself as movement of force, in other words the knowledge separating itself
from its own working to watch that and take it into itself again by
feeling,—this is the basis of universal Sanjnana. This is true both of our
internal and external operations. I become anger by a vibration of conscious
force acting as nervous emotion and I feel the anger that I have become by
another movement of conscious force acting as light of knowledge. I am
conscious of my body because I have myself become the body; that same
force of conscious being which has made this form of itself, this presentation
of its workings knows it in that form, in that presentation. I can know nothing
except what I myself am; if I know others, it is because they also are myself,
because my self has assumed these apparently alien presentations as well as
that which is nearest to my own mental centre. All sensation, all action of
sense is thus the same in essence whether external or internal, physical or
psychical.
\par But this vibration of conscious being is presented to itself by various
forms of sense which answer to the successive operations of movement in its
assumption of form. For first we have intensity of vibration creating regular
rhythm which is the basis or constituent of all creative formation; secondly,
contact or intermiscence of the movements of conscious being which
constitute the rhythm; thirdly, definition of the grouping of movements which
are in contact, their shape; fourthly, the constant welling up of the essential
force to support in its continuity the movement that has been thus defined;
fifthly, the actual enforcement and compression of the force in its own
movement which maintains the form that has been assumed. In Matter these
five constituent operations are said by the Sankhyas to represent themselves
as five elemental conditions of substance, the etheric,
Page 152

atmospheric, igneous, liquid and solid; and the rhythm of vibration is seen by
them as \s{\'sabda}, sound, the basis of hearing, the intermiscence as contact,
the basis of touch, the definition as shape, the basis of sight, the upflow of
force as \s{rasa}, sap, the basis of taste, and the discharge of the atomic
compression as \s{gandha}, odour, the basis of smell. It is true that this is
only predicated of pure or subtle Matter; the physical matter of our world
being a mixed operation of force, these five elemental states are not found
there separately except in a very modified form. But all these are only the
physical workings or symbols. Essentially all formation, to the most subtle and
most beyond our senses such as form of mind, form of character, form of
soul, amount when scrutinised to this fivefold operation of conscious-force in
movement.
\par All these operations, then, the Sanjnana or essential sense must be able
to seize, to make its own by that union in knowledge of knower and object
which is peculiar to itself. Its sense of the rhythm or intensity of the vibrations
which contain in themselves all the meaning of the form, will be the basis of
the essential hearing of which our apprehension of physical sound or the
spoken word is only the most outward result; so also its sense of the contact
or intermiscence of conscious force with conscious force must be the basis
of the essential touch; its sense of the definition or form of force must be the
basis of the essential sight; its sense of the upflow of essential being in the
form, that which is the secret of its self-delight, must be the basis of the
essential taste; its sense of the compression of force and the self-discharge
of its essence of being must be the basis of the essential inhalation grossly
represented in physical substance by the sense of smell. On whatever plane,
to whatever kind of formation these essentialities of sense will apply
themselves and on each they will seek an appropriate organisation, an
appropriate functioning.
\par This various sense will, it is obvious, be in the highest consciousness a
complex unity, just as we have seen that there the various operation of
knowledge is also a complex unity. Even if we examine the physical senses,
say, the sense of hearing, if we observe how the underlying mind receives
their action, we shall
Page 153

see that in their essence all the senses are in each other. That mind is not
only aware of the vibration which we call sound; it is aware also of the
contact and interchange between the force in the sound and the nervous
force in us with which that intermixes; it is aware of the definition or form of
the sound and of the complex contacts or relations which make up the form;
it is aware of the essence or outwelling conscious force which constitutes
and maintains the sound and prolongs its vibrations in our nervous being; it is
aware of our own nervous inhalation of the vibratory discharge proceeding
from the compression of force which makes, so to speak, the solidity of the
sound. All these sensations enter into the sensitive reception and joy of music
which is the highest physical form of this operation of force,—they constitute
our physical sensitiveness to it and the joy of our nervous being in it; diminish
one of them and the joy and the sensitiveness are to that extent dulled. Much
more must there be this complex unity in a higher than the physical
consciousness and most of all must there be unity in the highest. But the
essential sense must be capable also of seizing the secret essence of all
conscious being in action, in itself and not only through the results of the
operation; its appreciation of these results can be nothing more than itself an
outcome of this deeper sense which it has of the essence of the Thing behind
its appearances.
\par If we consider these things thus subtly in the light of our own deeper
psychology and pursue them beyond the physical appearances by which they
are covered, we shall get to some intellectual conception of the sense behind
our senses or rather the Sense of our senses, the Sight of our sight and the
Hearing of our hearing. The Brahman-consciousness of which the Upanishad
speaks is not the Absolute withdrawn into itself, but that Absolute in its
outlook on the relative; it is the Lord, the Master-Soul, the governing
Transcendent and All, He who constitutes and controls the action of the gods
on the different planes of our being. Since it constitutes them, all our
workings can be no more than psychical and physical results and
representations of something essential proper to its supreme creative outlook,
our sense a shadow of the divine Sense, our sight of the divine Sight, our
Page 154

hearing of the divine Hearing. Nor is that divine Sight and Hearing limited to
things physical, but extend themselves to all forms and operations of
conscious being.
\par The supreme Consciousness does not depend on what we call sight and
hearing for its own essential seeing and audition. It operates by a supreme
Sense, creative and comprehensive, of which our physical and psychical sight
and hearing are external results and partial operations. Neither is it ignorant
of these, nor excludes them; for since it constitutes and controls, it must be
aware of them but from a supreme plane, \s{para\.m dh\=ama}, which includes
all in its view; for its original action is that highest movement of Vishnu
which, the Veda tells us, the seers behold like an eye extended in heaven. It
is that by which the soul sees its seeings and hears its hearings; but all sense
only assumes its true value and attains to its absolute, its immortal reality
when we cease to pursue the satisfactions of the mere external and physical
senses and go beyond even the psychical being to this spiritual or essential
which is the source and fountain, the knower, constituent and true valuer of
all the rest.
\par This spiritual sense of things, secret and superconscient in us, alone gives
their being, worth and reality to the psychical and physical sense; in
themselves they have none. When we attain to it, these inferior operations
are as it were taken up into it and the whole world and everything in it
changes to us and takes on a different and a non-material value. That
Master-consciousness in us senses our sensations of objects, sees our
seeings, hears our hearings no longer for the benefit of the senses and their
desires, but with the embrace of the self-existent Bliss which has no cause,
beginning or end, eternal in its own immortality.

\ht The Superlife—Life of Our Life
\par\drop But the Brahman-consciousness is not only Mind of our mind,
Speech of our speech, Sense of our sense; it is also Life of our life. In other
words, it is a supreme and universal energy of existence of which our own
material life and its sustaining energy are only an inferior result, a physical
symbol, an external and limited functioning. That which governs our existence
and its functionings, does not live and act by them, but is their superior cause
and the supra-vital principle out of which they are formed and by which they
are controlled.
\par The English word life does duty for many very different shades of
meaning; but the word Prana familiar in the Upanishad and in the language of
Yoga is restricted to the life-force whether viewed in itself or in its
functionings. The popular significance of Prana was indeed the breath drawn
into and thrown out from the lungs and so, in its most material and common
sense, the life or the life-breath; but this is not the philosophic significance of
the word as it is used in the Upanishads. The Prana of the Upanishads is the
life-energy itself which was supposed to occupy and act in the body with a
fivefold movement, each with its characteristic name and each quite as
necessary to the functioning of the life of the body as the act of respiration.
Respiration in fact is only one action of the chief movement of the
life-energy, the first of the five,—the action which is most normally
necessary and vital to the maintenance and distribution of the energy in the
physical frame, but which can yet be suspended without the life being
necessarily destroyed.
\par The existence of a vital force or life-energy has been doubted by
western Science, because that Science concerns itself only with the most
external operations of Nature and has as yet no true knowledge of anything
except the physical and outward. This Prana, this life-force is not physical in
itself; it is not material energy, but rather a different principle supporting
Matter and involved in it. It supports and occupies all forms and without it no
physical form could have come into being or could remain in
Page 156

being. It acts in all material forces such as electricity and is nearest to
self-manifestation in those that are nearest to pure force; material forces
could not exist or act without it, for from it they derive their energy and
movement and they are its vehicles. But all material aspects are only field
and form of the Prana which is in itself a pure energy, their cause and not
their result. It cannot therefore be detected by any physical analysis; physical
analysis can only resolve for us the combinations of those material
happenings which are its results and the external signs and symbols of its
presence and operation.
\par How then do we become aware of its existence? By that purification of
our mind and body and that subtilisation of our means of sensation and
knowledge which become possible through Yoga. We become capable of
analysis other than the resolution of forms into their gross physical elements
and are able to distinguish the operations of the pure mental principle from
those of the material and both of these from the vital or dynamic which forms
a link between them and supports them both. We are then able to distinguish
the movements of the Pranic currents not only in the physical body which is
all that we are normally aware of, but in that subtle frame of our being which
Yoga detects underlying and sustaining the physical. This is ordinarily done
by the process of Pranayama, the government and control of the respiration.
By Pranayama the Hathayogin is able to control, suspend and transcend the
ordinary fixed operation of the Pranic energy which is all that Nature needs
for the normal functioning of the body and of the physical life and mind, and
he becomes aware of the channels in which that energy distributes itself in all
its workings and is therefore able to do things with his body which seem
miraculous to the ignorant, just as the physical scientist by his knowledge of
the workings of material forces is able to do things with them which would
seem to us magic if their law and process were not divulged. For all the
workings of life in the physical form are governed by the Prana and not only
those which are normal and constant and those which, being always potential,
can be easily brought forward and set in action, but those which are of a
more remote potentiality and seem to our average experience difficult or
impossible.
Page 157

\par But the Pranic energy supports not only the operations of our physical
life, but also those of the mind in the living body. Therefore by the control of
the Pranic energy it is not only possible to control our physical and vital
functionings and to transcend their ordinary operation, but to control also the
workings of the mind and to transcend its ordinary operations. The human
mind in fact depends always on the Pranic force which links it with the body
through which it manifests itself, and it is able to deploy its own force only in
proportion as it can make that energy available for its own uses and
subservient to its own purposes. In proportion, therefore, as the Yogin gets
back to the control of the Prana, and by the direction of its batteries opens up
those nervous centres (\sforced{cakras}) in which it is now sluggish or only
partially operative, he is able to manifest powers of mind, sense and
consciousness which transcend our ordinary experience. The so-called occult
powers of Yoga are such faculties which thus open up of themselves as the
Yogin advances in the control of the Pranic force and, purifying the channels
of its movement, establishes an increasing communication between the
consciousness of his subtle subliminal being and the consciousness of his
gross physical and superficial existence.
\par Thus the Prana is vital or nervous force which bears the operations of
mind and body, is yoked by them as it were like a horse to a chariot and
driven by the mind along the paths on which it wishes to travel to the goal of
its desire. Therefore it is described in this Upanishad as yoked and moving
forward and again as being led forward, the images recalling the Vedic
symbol of the Horse by which the Pranic force is constantly designated in the
Rig-veda. It is in fact that which does all the action of the world in obedience
to conscious or subconscious mind and in the conditions of material force and
material form. While the mind is that movement of Nature in us which
represents in the mould of our material and phenomenal existence and within
the triple term of the Ignorance the knowledge aspect of the Brahman, the
consciousness of the knower, and body is that which similarly represents the
being of the existent in the mask of phenomenally divisible substance, so
Prana or life-energy represents in the flux of phenomenal things the force,
the active dynamis of the Lord
Page 158

who controls and enjoys the manifestation of His own being.
\note{The three are the reverse aspects of Chit, Sat and Chit-Tapas.} It is a
universal energy present in every atom and particle of the universe, and
active in every stirring and current of the constant flux and interchange which
constitutes the world.
\par But just as mind is only an inferior movement of the supreme
Conscious-Being and above mind there is a divine and infinite principle of
consciousness, will and knowledge which controls the ignorant action of mind,
and it is by this superior principle and not by mind that Brahman cognises His
own being whether in itself or in its manifestation, so also it must be with this
Life-force. The characteristics of the Life-force as it manifests itself in us
are desire, hunger, an enjoyment which devours the object enjoyed and a
sensational movement and activity of response which gropes after possession
and seeks to pervade, embrace, take into itself the object of its
desire.
\note{All these significances are intended by the Vedic Rishis in their use of
the word \s{a\'sva}, Horse, for the \s{pr\=a\,na}, the root being capable of all of
them as we see from the words \s{\=a\'s\=a}, hope; \s{a\'san\=a}, hunger; \s{a\'s}, to
eat; \s{a\'s}, to enjoy; \s{\=a\'su}, swift; \s{a\'s}, to move, attain, pervade, etc.} It
is not in this breath of desire and mortal enjoyment that the true life can
consist or the highest, divine energy act, any more than the supreme
knowledge can think in the terms of ignorant, groping, limited and divided
mind. As the movements of mind are merely representations in the terms of
the duality and the ignorance, reflections of a supreme consciousness and
knowledge, so the movements of this life-force can only be similar
representations of a supreme energy expressing a higher and truer existence
possessed of that consciousness and knowledge and therefore free from
desire, hunger, transient enjoyment and hampered activity. What is desire
here must there be self-existent Will or Love; what is hunger here must there
be desireless satisfaction; what is here enjoyment must there be self-existent
delight; what is here a groping action and response, must be there
self-possessing and all-possessing energy,—such must be the Life of our life
by which this inferior action is sustained and led to its goal. Brahman does not
breathe with the breath, does not live by this Life-force and its dual terms of
birth and death.
\par What then is this Life of our life? It is the supreme Energy
\note{Tapas or Chit-Shakti.}
Page 159

which is nothing but the infinite force in action of the supreme conscious
Being in His own illumined self. The Self-existent is luminously aware of
Himself and full of His own delight; and that self-awareness is a timeless
self-possession which in action reveals itself as a force of infinite
consciousness omnipotent as well as omniscient; for it exists between two
poles, one of eternal stillness and pure identity, the other of eternal energy
and identity of All with itself, the stillness eternally supporting the energy.
That is the true existence, the Life from which our life proceeds; that is the
immortality, while what we cling to as life is “hunger that is death”.
Therefore the object of the wise must be to pass in their illumined
consciousness beyond the false and phenomenal terms of life and death to
this immortality.
\par Yet is this Life-force, however inferior its workings, instinct with the
being, will, light of that which it represents, of that which transcends it; by
That it is “led forward” on its paths to a goal which its own existence implies
by the very imperfection of its movements and renderings. This death called
life is not only a dark figure of that light, but it is the passage by which we
pass through transmutation of our being from the death-sleep of Matter into
the spirit's infinite immortality.

\ht The Great Transition
\par\drop The thought of the Upanishad as expressed in its first chapter in the
brief and pregnant sentences of the Upanishadic style, amounts then to this
result that the life of the mind, senses, vital activities in which we dwell is not
the whole or the chief part of our existence, not the highest, not self-existent,
not master of itself. It is an outer fringe, a lower result, an inferior working of
something beyond; a superconscient Existence has developed, supports and
governs this partial and fragmentary, this incomplete and unsatisfying
consciousness and activity of the mind, life and senses. To rise out of this
external and surface consciousness towards and into that superconscient is
our progress, our goal, our destiny of completeness and satisfaction.
\par The Upanishad does not assert the unreality, but only the incompleteness
and inferiority of our present existence. All that we follow after here is an
imperfect representation, a broken and divided functioning of what is
eternally in an absolute perfection on that higher plane of existence. This
mind of ours unpossessed of its object, groping, purblind, besieged by error
and incapacity, its action founded on an external vision of things, is only the
shadow thrown by a superconscient Knowledge which possesses, creates
and securely uses the truth of things because nothing is external to it, nothing
is other than itself, nothing is divided or at war within its all-comprehensive
self-awareness. That is the Mind of our mind. Our speech, limited,
mechanical, imperfectly interpretative of the outsides of things, restricted by
the narrow circle of the mind, based on the appearances of sense is only the
far-off and feeble response, the ignorant vibration returned to a creative and
revelatory Word which has built up all the forms which our mind and speech
seek to comprehend and express. Our sense, a movement in stuff of
consciousness vibratory to outward impacts, attempting imperfectly to grasp
them by laboured and separately converging reactions, is only the faulty
image of a supreme Sense which at once, fully, harmoniously unites itself
with and enjoys all that the supreme Mind and
Page 161

Speech create in the self-joyous activity of the divine and infinite existence.
Our life, a breath of force and movement and possession attached to a form
of mind and body and restricted by the form, limited in its force, hampered in
its movement, besieged in its possession and therefore a thing of discords at
war with itself and its environment, hungering and unsatisfied, moving
inconstantly from object to object and unable to embrace and retain their
multiplicity, devouring its objects of enjoyment and therefore transient in its
enjoyments, is only a broken movement of the one, undivided, infinite Life
which is all-possessing and ever satisfied because in all it enjoys its eternal
self unimprisoned by the divisions of Space, unoccupied by the moments of
Time, undeluded by the successions of Cause and Circumstance.
\par This superconscient Existence, one, conscious of itself, conscious both of
its eternal peace and its omniscient and omnipotent force, is also conscious of
our cosmic existence which it holds in itself, inspires secretly and
omnipotently governs. It is the Lord of the Isha Upanishad who inhabits all
the creations of His Force, all form of movement in the ever mobile principle
of cosmos. It is our self and that of which and by which we are constituted in
all our being and activities, the Brahman. The mortal life is a dual
representation of That with two conflicting elements in it, negative and
positive. Its negative elements of death, suffering, incapacity, strife, division,
limitation are a dark figure which conceal and serve the development of that
which its positive elements cannot yet achieve,—immortality hiding itself
from life in the figure of death, delight hiding itself from pleasure in the figure
of suffering, infinite force hiding itself from finite effort in the figure of
incapacity, fusion of love hiding itself from desire in the figure of strife, unity
hiding itself from acquisition in the figure of division, infinity hiding itself from
growth in the figure of limitation. The positive elements suggest what the
Brahman is, but never are what the Brahman is, although their victory, the
victory of the gods, is always the victory of the Brahman over its own
self-negations, always the self-affirmation of His vastness against the denials
of the dark and limiting figure of things. Still, it is not this vastness merely, but
the absolute infinity which is Brahman itself. And therefore within this dual
figure of things
Page 162

we cannot attain to our self, our Highest; we have to transcend in order to
attain. Our pursuit of the positive elements of this existence, our worship of
the gods of the mind, life, sense is only a preparatory to the real travail of the
soul, and we must leave this lower Brahman and know that Higher if we are
to fulfil ourselves. We pursue, for instance, our mental growth, we become
mental beings full of an accomplished thought-power and thought-acquisition,
\s{dh\=ir\=a\,h}, in order that we may by thought of mind go beyond mind itself to
the Eternal. For always the life of mind and senses is the jurisdiction of death
and limitation; beyond is the immortality.
\par The wise, therefore, the souls seated and accomplished in luminous
thought-power put away from them the dualities of our mind, life and senses
and go forward from this world; they go beyond to the unity and the
immortality. The word used for going forward is that which expresses the
passage of death; it is also that which the Upanishad uses for the forward
movement of the Life-force yoked to the car of embodied mind and sense on
the paths of life. And in this coincidence we can find a double and most
pregnant suggestion.
\par It is not by abandoning life on earth in order to pursue immortality on
other more favourable planes of existence that the great achievement
becomes possible. It is here, \s{ihaiva}, in this mortal life and body that
immortality must be won, here in this lower Brahman and by this embodied
soul that the Higher must be known and possessed. “If here one find it not,
great is the perdition.” This Life-force in us is led forward by the attraction of
the supreme Life on its path of constant acquisition through types of the
Brahman until it reaches a point where it has to go entirely forward, to go
across out of the mortal life, the mortal vision of things to some Beyond. So
long as death is not entirely conquered, this going beyond is represented in the
terms of death and by a passing into other worlds where death is not present,
where a type of immortality is tasted corresponding to that which we have
found here in our soul-experience; but the attraction of death and limitation is
not overpassed because they still conceal something of immortality and
infinity which we have not yet achieved; therefore there is a necessity of
return, an insistent
Page 163

utility of farther life in the mortal body which we do not overcome until we
have passed beyond all types to the very being of the Infinite, One and
Immortal.
\par The worlds of which the Upanishad speaks are essentially
soul-conditions and not geographical divisions of the cosmos. This material
universe is itself only existence as we see it when the soul dwells on the
plane of material movement and experience in which the spirit involves itself
in form, and therefore all the framework of things in which it moves by the
life and which it embraces by the consciousness is determined by the
principle of infinite division and aggregation proper to Matter, to substance of
form. This becomes then its world or vision of things. And to whatever
soul-condition it climbs, its vision of things will change from the material
vision and correspond to that other condition, and in that other framework it
will move in its living and embrace it in its consciousness. These are the
worlds of the ancient tradition.
\par But the soul that has entirely realised immortality passes beyond all
worlds and is free from frameworks. It enters into the being of the Lord; like
this supreme superconscient Self and Brahman, it is not subdued to life and
death. It is no longer subject to the necessity of entering into the cycle of
rebirth, of travelling continually between the imprisoning dualities of death and
birth, affirmation and negation; for it has transcended name and form. This
victory, this supreme immortality it must achieve here as an embodied soul in
the mortal framework of things. Afterwards, like the Brahman, it transcends
and yet embraces the cosmic existence without being subject to it. Personal
freedom, personal fulfilment is then achieved by the liberation of the soul
from imprisonment in the form of this changing personality and by its ascent
to the One that is the All. If afterwards there is any assumption of the figure
of mortality, it is an assumption and not a subjection, a help brought to the
world and not a help to be derived from it, a descent of the ensouled
superconscient existence not from any personal necessity, but from the
universal need in the cosmic labour for those yet unfree and unfulfilled to be
helped and strengthened by the force that has already described the path up
to the goal in its experience and achieved under the same conditions the
Work and the Sacrifice.
\par

\par\drop Before we can proceed to the problem how, being what we are and
the Brahman being what it is, we can effect the transition from the status of
mind, life and senses proper to man over to the status proper to the supreme
Consciousness which is master of mind, life and senses, another and prior
question arises. The Upanishad does not state it explicitly, but implies and
answers it with the strongest emphasis on the solution and the subtlest variety
in its repetition of the apparent paradox that is presented.
\par The Master-Consciousness of the Brahman is that for which we have to
abandon this lesser status of the mere creature subject to the movement of
Nature in the cosmos; but after all this Master-Consciousness, however high
and great a thing it may be, has a relation to the universe and the cosmic
movement; it cannot be the utter Absolute, Brahman superior to all
relativities. This Conscious-Being who originates, supports and governs our
mind, life, senses is the Lord; but where there is no universe of relativities,
there can be no Lord, for there is no movement to transcend and govern. Is
not then this Lord, as one might say in a later language, not so much the
creator of Maya as himself a creation of Maya? Do not both Lord and
cosmos disappear when we go beyond all cosmos? And is it not beyond all
cosmos that the only true reality exists? Is it not this only true reality and not
the Mind of our mind, the Sense of our sense, the Life of our life, the Word
behind our speech, which we have to know and possess? As we must go
behind all effects to the Cause, must we not equally go beyond the Cause to
that in which neither cause nor effects exist? Is not even the immortality
spoken of in the Veda and Upanishads a petty thing to be overpassed and
abandoned? and should we not reach towards the utter Ineffable where
mortality and immortality cease to have any meaning?
\par The Upanishad does not put to itself the question in this form and
language which only became possible when Nihilistic Buddhism and Vedantic
Illusionism had passed over the face
Page 165

of our thought and modified philosophical speech and concepts. But it knows
of the ineffable Absolute which is the utter reality and absoluteness of the
Lord even as the Lord is the absolute of all that is in the cosmos. Of That it
proceeds to speak in the only way in which it can be spoken of by the human
mind.
\par Its answer to the problem is that That is precisely the
Unknowable
\note{\s{Aj\~neyam atarkyam.}} of which no relations can be
affirmed
\note{\s{Avyavah\=aryam.}} and about which therefore our intellect must for
ever be silent. The injunction to know the utterly Unknowable would be
without any sense or practical meaning. Not that That is a Nihil, a pure
Negative, but it cannot either be described by any of the positives of which
our mind, speech or perception is capable, nor even can it be indicated by any
of them. It is only a little that we know; it is only in the terms of the little that
we can put the mental forms of our knowledge. Even when we go beyond to
the real form of the Brahman which is not this universe, we can only indicate,
we cannot really describe. If then we think we have known it perfectly, we
betray our ignorance; we show that we know very little indeed, not even the
little that we can put into the forms of our knowledge. For the universe seen
as our mind sees it is the little, the divided, the parcelling out of existence and
consciousness in which we know and express things by fragments, and we
can never really cage in our intellectual and verbal fictions that infinite
totality. Yet it is through the principles manifested in the universe that we
have to arrive at That, through the life, through the mind and through that
highest mental knowledge which grasps at the fundamental Ideas that are like
doors concealing behind them the Brahman and yet seeming to reveal Him.
\par Much less, then, if we can only thus know the Master-Consciousness
which is the form of the Brahman, can we pretend to know its utter ineffable
reality which is beyond all knowledge. But if this were all, there would be no
hope for the soul and a resigned Agnosticism would be the last word of
wisdom. The truth is that though thus beyond our mentality and our highest
ideative knowledge, the Supreme does give Himself both to this knowledge
and to our mentality in the way proper to each and by following that way we
can arrive at Him, but only
Page 166

on condition that we do not take our mentalising by the mind and our knowing
by the higher thought for the full knowledge and rest in that with a satisfied
possession.
\par The way is to use our mind rightly for such knowledge as is open to its
highest, purified capacity. We have to know the form of the Brahman, the
Master-Consciousness of the Lord through and yet beyond the universe in
which we live. But first we must put aside what is mere form and
phenomenon in the universe; for that has nothing to do with the form of the
Brahman, the body of the Self, since it is not His form, but only His most
external mask. Our first step therefore must be to get behind the forms of
Matter, the forms of Life, the forms of Mind and go back to that which is
essential, most real, nearest to actual entity. And when we have gone on thus
eliminating, thus analysing all forms into the fundamental entities of the
cosmos, we shall find that these fundamental entities are really only two,
ourselves and the gods.
\par The gods of the Upanishad have been supposed to be a figure for the
senses, but although they act in the senses, they are yet much more than that.
They represent the divine power in its great and fundamental cosmic
functionings whether in man or in mind and life and matter in general; they
are not the functionings themselves but something of the Divine which is
essential to their operation and its immediate possessor and cause. They are,
as we see from other Upanishads, positive self-representations of the
Brahman leading to good, joy, light, love, immortality as against all that is a
dark negation of these things. And it is necessarily in the mind, life, senses,
and speech of man that the battle here reaches its height and approaches to
its full meaning. The gods seek to lead these to good and light; the Titans,
sons of darkness, seek to pierce them with ignorance and evil.
\note{\s{Chhandogya and Brihadaranyaka Upanishads}.} Behind the gods is
the Master-Consciousness of which they are the positive cosmic
self-representations.
\par The other entity which represents the Brahman in the cosmos is the self
of the living and thinking creature, man. This self also is not an external
mask; it is not form of the mind or form of the life or form of the body. It is
something that supports these and
Page 167

makes them possible, something that can say positively like the gods, “I am”
and not only “I seem”. We have then to scrutinise these two entities and see
what they are in relation to each other and to the Brahman; or, as the
Upanishad puts it, “That of it which is thou, that of it which is in the gods, {\it
this} is what thy mind has to resolve.” Well, but what then of the Brahman is
myself? and what of the Brahman is in the Gods? The answer is evident. I
am a representation in the cosmos, but for all purposes of the cosmos a real
representation of the Self; and the gods are a representation in the
cosmos—a real representation since without them the cosmos could not
continue—of the Lord. The one supreme Self is the essentiality of all these
individual existences; the one supreme Lord is the Godhead in the gods.
\par The Self and the Lord are one Brahman, whom we can realise through
our self and realise through that which is essential in the cosmic movement.
Just as our self constitutes our mind, body, life, senses, so that Self constitutes
all mind, body, life, senses; it is the origin and essentiality of things. Just as the
gods govern, supported by our self, the cosmos of our individual being, the
action of our mind, senses and life, so the Lord governs as Mind of the mind,
Sense of the sense, Life of the life, supporting His active divinity by His silent
essential self-being, all cosmos and all form of being. As we have gone
behind the forms of the cosmos to that which is essential in their being and
movement and found our self and the gods, so we have to go behind our self
and the gods and find the one supreme Self and the one supreme Godhead.
Then we can say, “I think that I know.”
\par But at once we have to qualify our assertion. I think not that I know
perfectly, for that is impossible in the terms of our instruments of knowledge.
I do not think for a moment that I know the Unknowable, that that can be put
into the forms through which I must arrive at the Self and Lord; but at the
same time I am no longer in ignorance, I know the Brahman in the only way
in which I can know Him, in His self-revelation to me in terms not beyond the
grasp of my psychology, manifest as the Self and the Lord. The mystery of
existence is revealed in a way that utterly satisfies my being because it
enables me first to comprehend it through these figures as far as it can be
comprehended
Page 168

by me and, secondly, to enter into, to live in, to be one in law and being with
and even to merge myself in the Brahman.
\par If we fancy that we have grasped the Brahman by the mind and in that
delusion fix down our knowledge of Him to the terms our mentality has
found, then our knowledge is no knowledge; it is the little knowledge that
turns to falsehood. So too those who try to fix Him into our notion of the
fundamental ideas in which we discern Him by the thought that rises above
ordinary mental perception, have no real discernment of the Brahman, since
they take certain idea-symbols for the Reality. On the other hand if we
recognise that our mental perceptions are simply so many clues by which we
can rise beyond mental perception and if we use these fundamental
idea-symbols and the arrangement of them which our uttermost thought
makes in order to go beyond the symbol to that reality, then we have rightly
used mind and the higher discernment for their supreme purpose. Mind and
the higher discernment are satisfied of the Brahman even in being exceeded
by Him.
\par The mind can only reflect in a sort of supreme understanding and
experience the form, the image of the supreme as He shows Himself to our
mentality. Through this reflection we find, we know; the purpose of
knowledge is accomplished, for we find immortality, we enter into the law,
the being, the beatitude of the Brahman-consciousness. By self-realisation of
Brahman as our self we find the force, the divine energy which lifts us
beyond the limitation, weakness, darkness, sorrow, all-pervading death of our
mortal existence; by the knowledge of the one Brahman in all beings and in
all the various movement of the cosmos we attain beyond these things to the
infinity, the omnipotent being, the omniscient light, the pure beatitude of that
divine existence.
\par This great achievement must be done here in this mortal world, in this
limited body; for if we do it, we arrive at our true existence and are no longer
bound down to our phenomenal becoming. But if here we find it not, great is
the loss and perdition; for we remain continually immersed in the phenomenal
life of the mind and body and do not rise above it into the true supramental
existence. Nor, if we miss it here, will death give it to us by our passage to
another and less difficult world. Only those
Page 169

who use their awakened self and enlightened powers to distinguish and
discover that One and Immortal in all existences, the all-originating self, the
all-inhabiting Lord, can make the real passage which transcends life and
death, can pass out of this mortal status, can press beyond and rise upward
into a world-transcending immortality.
\par This, then, and no other is the means to be seized on and the goal to be
reached. “There is no other path for the great journey.” The Self and the
Lord are that indeterminable, unknowable, ineffable Parabrahman and when
we seek rather that which is indeterminable and unknowable to us, it is still
the Self and the Lord always that we find, though by an attempt which is not
the straight and possible road intended for the embodied soul seeking here to
accomplish its true existence.
\note{\s{Gita.}} They are the self-manifested Reality which so places itself
before man as the object of his highest aspiration and the fulfilment of all his
activities.

\ht The Parable of the Gods
\par\drop From its assertion of the relative knowableness of the unknowable
Brahman and the justification of the soul's aspiration towards that which is
beyond its present capacity and status the Upanishad turns to the question of
the means by which that high-reaching aspiration can put itself into relation
with the object of its search. How is the veil to be penetrated and the subject
consciousness of man to enter into the master-consciousness of the Lord?
What bridge is there over this gulf? Knowledge has already been pointed out
as the supreme means open to us, a knowledge which begins by a sort of
reflection of the true existence in the awakened mental understanding. But
Mind is one of the gods; the Light behind it is indeed the greatest of the gods,
Indra. Then, an awakening of all the gods through their greatest to the
essence of that which they are, the one Godhead which they represent. By
the mentality opening itself to the Mind of our mind, the sense and speech
also will open themselves to the Sense of our sense and to the Word behind
our speech and the life to the Life of our life. The Upanishad proceeds to
develop this consequence of its central suggestion by a striking parable or
apologue.
\par The gods, the powers that affirm the Good, the Light, the Joy and
Beauty, the Strength and Mastery have found themselves victorious in their
eternal battle with the powers that deny. It is Brahman that has stood behind
the gods and conquered for them; the Master of all who guides all has thrown
His deciding will into the balance, put down his darkened children and exalted
the children of Light. In this victory of the Master of all the gods are
conscious of a mighty development of themselves, a splendid efflorescence
of their greatness in man, their joy, their light, their glory, their power and
pleasure. But their vision is as yet sealed to their own deeper truth; they
know of themselves, they know not the Eternal; they know the godheads,
they do not know God. Therefore they see the victory as their own, the
greatness as their own. This opulent efflorescence of the gods and
Page 171

uplifting of their greatness and light is the advance of man to his ordinary
ideal of a perfectly enlightened mentality, a strong and sane vitality, a
well-ordered body and senses, a harmonious, rich, active and happy life, the
Hellenic ideal which the modern world holds to be our ultimate potentiality.
When such an efflorescence takes place whether in the individual or the kind,
the gods in man grow luminous, strong, happy; they feel they have conquered
the world and they proceed to divide it among themselves and enjoy it.
\par But such is not the full intention of Brahman in the universe or in the
creature. The greatness of the gods is His own victory and greatness, but it is
only given in order that man may grow nearer to the point at which his
faculties will be strong enough to go beyond themselves and realise the
Transcendent. Therefore Brahman manifests Himself before the exultant
gods in their well-ordered world and puts to them by His silence the
heart-shaking, the world-shaking question, “If ye are all, then what am I? for
see, I am and I am here.” Though He manifests, He does not reveal Himself,
but is seen and felt by them as a vague and tremendous presence, the
Yaksha, the Daemon, the Spirit, the unknown Power, the Terrible beyond
good and evil for whom good and evil are instruments towards His final
self-expression. Then there is alarm and confusion in the divine assembly;
they feel a demand and a menace; on the side of the evil the possibility of
monstrous and appalling powers yet unknown and unmastered which may
wreck the fair world they have built, upheave and shatter to pieces the
brilliant harmony of the intellect, the aesthetic mind, the moral nature, the vital
desires, the body and senses which they have with such labour established;
on the side of the good the demand of things unknown which are beyond all
these and therefore are equally a menace, since the little which is realised
cannot stand against the much that is unrealised, cannot shut out the vast, the
infinite that presses against the fragile walls we have erected to define and
shelter our limited being and pleasure. Brahman presents itself to them as the
Unknown; the gods knew not what was this Daemon.
\par Therefore Agni first arises at their bidding to discover its nature, limits,
identity. The gods of the Upanishad differ in one
Page 172

all-important respect from the gods of the Rig-veda; for the latter are not only
powers of the One, but conscious of their source and true identity; they know
the Brahman, they dwell in the supreme Godhead, their origin, home and
proper plane is the superconscient Truth. It is true they manifest themselves
in man in the form of human faculties and assume the appearance of human
limitations, manifest themselves in the lower cosmos and assume the mould
of its cosmic operations; but this is only their lesser and lower movement and
beyond it they are for ever the One, the Transcendent and Wonderful, the
Master of Force and Delight and Knowledge and Being. But in the
Upanishads the Brahman idea has grown and cast down the gods from this
high pre-eminence so that they appear only in their lesser human and cosmic
workings. Much of their other Vedic aspects they keep. Here the three gods
Indra, Vayu, Agni represent the cosmic Divine on each of its three planes,
Indra on the mental, Vayu on the vital, Agni on the material. In that order,
therefore, beginning from the material they approach the Brahman.
\par Agni is the heat and flame of the conscious force in Matter which has
built up the universe; it is he who has made life and mind possible and
developed them in the material universe where he is the greatest deity.
Especially he is the primary impeller of speech of which Vayu is the medium
and Indra the lord. This heat of conscious force in Matter is Agni Jatavedas,
the knower of all births: of all things born, of every cosmic phenomenon he
knows the law, the process, the limit, the relation. If then it is some mighty
Birth of the cosmos that stands before them, some new indeterminate
developed in the cosmic struggle and process, who shall know him, determine
his limits, strength, potentialities if not Agni Jatavedas?
\par Full of confidence he rushes towards the object of his search and is met
by the challenge, “Who art thou? What is the force in thee?” His name is
Agni Jatavedas, the Power that is at the basis of all birth and process in the
material universe and embraces and knows their workings and the force in
him is this that all that is thus born, he as the flame of Time and Death can
devour. All things are his food which he assimilates and turns into material of
new birth and formation. But this all-devourer
Page 173

cannot devour with all his force a fragile blade of grass so long as it has
behind it the power of the Eternal. Agni is compelled to return, not having
discovered. One thing only is settled that this Daemon is no Birth of the
material cosmos, no transient thing that is subject to the flame and breath of
Time; it is too great for Agni.
\par Another god rises to the call. It is Vayu Matarishwan, the great
Life-Principle, he who moves, breathes, expands infinitely in the mother
element. All things in the universe are the movement of this mighty Life; it is
he who has brought Agni and placed him secretly in all existence; for him the
worlds have been upbuilded that Life may move in them, that it may act, that
it may riot and enjoy. If this Daemon be no birth of Matter, but some
stupendous Life-force active whether in the depths or on the heights of being,
who shall know it, who shall seize it in his universal expansion if not Vayu
Matarishwan?
\par There is the same confident advance upon the object, the same
formidable challenge, “Who art thou? What is the force in thee?” This is
Vayu Matarishwan and the power in him is this that he, the Life, can take all
things in his stride and growth and seize on them for his mastery and
enjoyment. But even the veriest frailest trifle he cannot seize and master so
long as it is protected against him by the shield of the Omnipotent. Vayu too
returns, not having discovered. One thing only is settled that this is no form or
force of cosmic Life which operates within the limits of the all-grasping vital
impulse; it is too great for Vayu.
\par Indra next arises, the Puissant, the Opulent. Indra is the power of the
Mind; the senses which the Life uses for enjoyment, are operations of Indra
which he conducts for knowledge and all things that Agni has upbuilt and
supports and destroys in the universe are Indra's field and the subject of his
functioning. If then this unknown Existence is something that the senses can
grasp or, if it is something that the mind can envisage, Indra shall know it and
make it part of his opulent possessions. But it is nothing that the senses can
grasp or the mind envisage, for as soon as Indra approaches it, it vanishes.
The mind can only envisage what is limited by Time and Space and this
Brahman is that which, as the Rig-veda has said, is neither today nor
Page 174

tomorrow and though it moves and can be approached in the conscious being
of all conscious existences, yet when the mind tries to approach it and study it
in itself, it vanishes from the view of the mind. The Omnipresent cannot be
seized by the senses, the Omniscient cannot be known by the mentality.
\par But Indra does not turn back from the quest like Agni and Vayu; he
pursues his way through the highest ether of the pure mentality and there he
approaches the Woman, the many-shining, Uma Haimavati; from her he
learns that this Daemon is the Brahman by whom alone the gods of mind and
life and body conquer and affirm themselves, and in whom alone they are
great. Uma is the supreme Nature from whom the whole cosmic action takes
its birth; she is the pure summit and highest power of the One who here
shines out in many forms. From this supreme Nature which is also the
supreme Consciousness the gods must learn their own truth; they must
proceed by reflecting it in themselves instead of limiting themselves to their
own lower movement. For she has the knowledge and consciousness of the
One, while the lower nature of mind, life and body can only envisage the
many. Although therefore Indra, Vayu and Agni are the greatest of the gods,
the first coming to know the existence of the Brahman, the others
approaching and feeling the touch of it, yet it is only by entering into contact
with the supreme consciousness and reflecting its nature and by the
elimination of the vital, mental, physical egoism so that their whole function
shall be to reflect the One and Supreme that Brahman can be known by the
gods in us and possessed. The conscious force that supports our embodied
life must become simply and purely a reflector of that supreme
Consciousness and Power of which its highest ordinary action is only a
twilight figure; the Life must become a passively potent reflection and pure
image of that supreme Life which is greater than all our utmost actual and
potential vitality; the Mind must resign itself to be no more than a faithful
mirror of the image of the superconscient Existence. By this conscious
surrender of mind, life and senses to the Master of our senses, life and mind
who alone really governs their action, by this turning of the cosmic existence
into a passive reflection of the eternal being and a faithful reproductor of the
nature of the Eternal we
Page 175

may hope to know and through knowledge to rise into that which is
superconscient to us; we shall enter into the Silence that is master of an
eternal, infinite, free and all-blissful activity.

\ht The Transfiguration of the Self\nl and the Gods
\par\drop The means of the knowledge of Brahman are, we have seen, to get
back behind the forms of the universe to that which is essential in the
cosmos,—and that which is essential is twofold, the gods in Nature and the
self in the individual,—and then to get behind these to the Beyond which they
represent. The practical relation of the gods to Brahman in this process of
divine knowledge has been already determined. The cosmic functionings
through which the gods act, mind, life, speech, senses, body, must become
aware of something beyond them which governs them, by which they are and
move, by whose force they evolve, enlarge themselves and arrive at power
and joy and capacity; to that they must turn from their ordinary operations;
leaving these, leaving the false idea of independent action and self-ordering
which is an egoism of mind and life and sense they must become consciously
passive to the power, light and joy of something which is beyond themselves.
What happens then is that this divine Unnameable reflects Himself openly in
the gods. His light takes possession of the thinking mind, His power and joy
of the life, His light and rapture of the emotional mind and the senses.
Something of the supreme image of Brahman falls upon the world-nature and
changes it into divine nature.
\par All this is not done by a sudden miracle. It comes by flashes, revelations,
sudden touches and glimpses; there is as if a leap of the lightning of
revelation flaming out from those heavens for a moment and then returning
into its secret source; as if the lifting of the eyelid of an inner vision and its
falling again because the eye cannot look long and steadily on the utter light.
The repetition of these touches and visitings from the Beyond fixes the gods
in their upward gaze and expectation, constant repetition fixes them in a
constant passivity; not moving out any longer to grasp at the forms of the
universe mind, life and senses will more and more be fixed in the memory, in
the understanding, in the joy of the touch and vision of that transcendent glory
which they have
Page 177

now resolved to make their sole object; to that only they will learn to respond
and not to the touches of outward things. The silence which has fallen on
them and which is now their foundation and status will become their
knowledge of the eternal silence which is Brahman; the response of their
functioning to a supernal light, power, joy will become their knowledge of the
eternal activity which is Brahman. Other status, other response and activity
they will not know. The mind will know nothing but the Brahman, think of
nothing but the Brahman, the Life will move to, embrace, enjoy nothing but
the Brahman, the eye will see, the ear hear, the other senses sense nothing
but the Brahman.
\par But is then a complete oblivion of the external the goal? Must the mind
and senses recede inward and fall into an unending trance and the life be for
ever stilled? This is possible, if the soul so wills, but it is not inevitable and
indispensable. The Mind is cosmic, one in all the universe; so too are the Life,
and the Sense, so too is Matter of the body; and when they exist in and for
the Brahman only, they will not only know this but will sense, feel and live in
that universal unity. Therefore to whatever thing they turn which to the
individual sense and mind and life seems now external to them, there also it is
not the mere form of things which they will know, think of, sense, embrace
and enjoy, but always and only the Brahman. Moreover, the external will
cease to exist for them, because nothing will be external but all things internal
to us, even the whole world and all that is in it. For the limit of ego, the wall
of individuality will break; the individual Mind will cease to know itself as
individual, it will be conscious only of universal Mind one everywhere in
which individuals are only knots of the one mentality; so the individual life will
lose its sense of separateness and live only in and as the one life in which all
individuals are simply whirls of the indivisible flood of Pranic activity; the very
body and senses will be no longer conscious of a separated existence, but the
real body which the man will feel himself to be physically will be the whole
Earth and the whole universe and the whole indivisible form of things
wheresoever existent, and the senses also will be converted to this principle
of sensation so that even in what we call the external, the eye will see
Brahman only in every sight, the ear will hear Brahman only in
Page 178

every sound, the inner and outer body will feel Brahman only in every touch
and the touch itself as if internal in the greater body. The soul whose gods
are thus converted to this supreme law and religion, will realise in the cosmos
itself and in all its multiplicity the truth of the One besides whom there is no
other or second. Moreover, becoming one with the formless and infinite, it
will exceed the universe itself and see all the worlds not as external, not even
as commensurate with itself, but as if within it.
\par And in fact, in the higher realisation it will not be Mind, Life, Sense of
which even the mind, life and sense themselves will be originally aware, but
rather that which constitutes them. By this process of constant visiting and
divine touch and influence the Mind of the mind, that is to say, the
superconscient Knowledge will take possession of the mental understanding
and begin to turn all its vision and thinking into luminous stuff and vibration of
light of the Supermind. So too the sense will be changed by the visitings of
the Sense behind the sense and the whole sense-view of the universe itself
will be altered so that the vital, mental and supramental will become visible to
the senses with the physical only as their last, outermost and smallest result.
So too the Life will become a superlife, a conscious movement of the infinite
Conscious-Force; it will be impersonal, unlimited by any particular acts and
enjoyment, unbound to their results, untroubled by the dualities or the touch of
sin and suffering, grandiose, boundless, immortal. The material world itself
will become for these gods a figure of the infinite, luminous and blissful
Superconscient.
\par This will be the transfiguration of the gods, but what of the self? For we
have seen that there are two fundamental entities, the gods and the self, and
the self in us is greater than the cosmic Powers, its Godward destination
more vital to our perfection and self-fulfilment than any transfiguration of
these lesser deities. Therefore not only must the gods find their one Godhead
and resolve themselves into it; that is to say, not only must the cosmic
principles working in us resolve themselves into the working of the One, the
Principle of all principles, so that they shall become only a unified existence
and single action of That in spite of all play of differentiation, but also and
with a more fundamental necessity the self in us which supports the action of
the gods must
Page 179

find and enter into the one Self of all individual existences, the indivisible
Spirit to whom all souls are no more than dark or luminous centres of its
consciousness.
\par This the self of man, since it is the essentiality of a mental being, will do
through the mind. In the gods the transfiguration is effected by the
Superconscient itself visiting their substance and opening their vision with its
flashes until it has transformed them; but the mind is capable of another
action which is only apparently movement of mind, but really the movement
of the self towards its own reality. The mind seems to go to That, to attain to
it; it is lifted out of itself into something beyond and, although it falls back, still
by the mind the will of knowledge in the mental thought continually and at last
continuously remembers that into which it has entered. On this the Self
through the mind seizes and repeatedly dwells and so doing it is finally caught
up into it and at last able to dwell securely in that transcendence. It
transcends the mind, it transcends its own mental individualisation of the
being, that which it now knows as itself; it ascends and takes foundation in
the Self of all and in the status of self-joyous infinity which is the supreme
manifestation of the Self. This is the transcendent immortality, this is the
spiritual existence which the Upanishads declare to be the goal of man and
by which we pass out of the mortal state into the heaven of the Spirit.
\par What then happens to the gods and the cosmos and all that the Lord
develops in His being? Does it not all disappear? Is not the transfiguration of
the gods even a mere secondary state through which we pass towards that
culmination and which drops away from us as soon as we reach it? And with
the disappearance of the gods and the cosmos does not the Lord too, the
Master-Consciousness, disappear so that nothing is left but the one pure
indeterminate Existence self-blissful in an eternal inaction and non-creation?
Such was the conclusion of the later Vedanta in its extreme monistic form
and such was the sense which it tried to read into all the Upanishads; but it
must be recognised that in the language whether of the Isha or the Kena
Upanishad there is absolutely nothing, not even a shade or a nuance pointing
to it. If we want to find it there, we have to put it in by force; for the actual
language used favours instead the
Page 180

conclusion of other Vedantic systems, which considered the goal to be the
eternal joy of the soul in a Brahmaloka or world of the Brahman in which it is
one with the infinite existence and yet in a sense still a soul able to enjoy
differentiation in the oneness.
\par In the next verse we have the culmination of the teaching of the
Upanishad, the result of the great transcendence which it has been setting
forth and afterwards the description of the immortality to which the souls of
knowledge attain when they pass beyond the mortal status. It declares that
Brahman is in its nature “That Delight,” Tadvanam. “Vana” is the Vedic
word for delight or delightful, and “Tadvanam” means therefore the
transcendent Delight, the all-blissful Ananda of which the Taittiriya
Upanishad speaks as the highest Brahman from which all existences are
born, by which all existences live and increase and into which all existences
arrive in their passing out of death and birth. It is as this transcendent Delight
that the Brahman must be worshipped and sought. It is this beatitude
therefore which is meant by the immortality of the Upanishads. And what
will be the result of knowing and possessing Brahman as the supreme
Ananda? It is that towards the knower and possessor of the Brahman is
directed the desire of all creatures. In other words, he becomes a centre of
the divine Delight shedding it on all the world and attracting all to it as to a
fountain of joy and love and self-fulfilment in the universe.
\par This is the culmination of the teaching of the Upanishad; there was a
demand for the secret teaching that enters into the ultimate truth, for the
“Upanishad”, and in response this doctrine has been given. It has been
uttered, the Upanishad of the Brahman, the hidden ultimate truth of the
supreme Existence; its beginning was the search for the Lord, Master of
mind, life, speech and senses in whom is the absolute of mind, the absolute of
life, the absolute of speech and senses and its close is the finding of Him as
the transcendent Beatitude and the elevation of the soul that finds and
possesses it into a living centre of that Delight towards which all creatures in
the universe shall turn as to a fountain of its ecstasies.
\tstar 
Page 181

\par The Upanishad closes with two verses which seem to review and
characterise the whole work in the manner of the ancient writings when they
have drawn to their close. This Upanishad or gospel of the inmost Truth of
things has for its foundation, it is said, the practice of self-mastery, action and
the subdual of the sense-life to the power of the Spirit. In other words, life
and works are to be used as a means of arriving out of the state of subjection
proper to the soul in the ignorance into a state of mastery which brings it
nearer to the absolute self-mastery and all-mastery of the supreme Soul
seated in the knowledge. The Vedas, that is to say, the utterances of the
inspired seers and the truths they hold, are described as all the limbs of the
Upanishad; in other words, all the convergent lines and aspects, all the
necessary elements of this great practice, this profound psychological
self-training and spiritual aspiration are set forth in these great Scriptures,
channels of supreme knowledge and indicators of a supreme discipline. Truth
is its home; and this Truth is not merely intellectual verity,—for that is not the
sense of the word in the Vedic writings,—but man's ultimate human state of
true being, true consciousness, right knowledge, right works, right joy of
existence, all indeed that is contrary to the falsehood of egoism and
ignorance. It is by these means, by using works and self-discipline for
mastery of oneself and for the generation of spiritual energy, by fathoming in
all its parts the knowledge and repeating the high example of the great Vedic
seers and by living in the Truth that one becomes capable of the great ascent
which the Upanishad opens to us.
\par The goal of the ascent is the world of the true and vast existence of
which the Veda speaks as the Truth that is the final goal and home of man. It
is described here as the greater infinite heavenly world, (Swargaloka,
Swarloka of the Veda), which is not the lesser Swarga of the Puranas or the
lesser Brahmaloka of the Mundaka Upanishad, its world of the sun's rays to
which the soul arrives by works of virtue and piety, but falls from them by the
exhaustion of their merit; it is the higher Swarga or Brahman-world of the
Katha which is beyond the dual symbols of birth and death, the higher
Brahman-worlds of the Mundaka which the soul enters by knowledge and
Page 182

renunciation. It is therefore a state not belonging to the Ignorance, but to
Knowledge. It is, in fact, the infinite existence and beatitude of the soul in the
being of the all-blissful existence; it is too the higher status, the light of the
Mind beyond the mind, the joy and eternal mastery of the Life beyond the
life, the riches of the Sense beyond the senses. And the soul finds in it not
only its own largeness but finds too and possesses the infinity of the One and
it has firm foundation in that immortal state because there a supreme Silence
and eternal Peace are the secure foundation of eternal Knowledge and
absolute Joy.

\ht A Last Word
\par\drop We have now completed our review of this Upanishad; we have
considered minutely the bearings of its successive utterances and striven to
make as precise as we can to the intelligence the sense of the puissant
phrases in which it gives us its leading clues to that which can never be
entirely expressed by human speech. We have some idea of what it means
by that Brahman, by the Mind of mind, the Life of life, the Sense of sense,
the Speech of speech, by the opposition of ourselves and the gods, by the
Unknowable who is yet not utterly unknowable to us, by the transcendence
of the mortal state and the conquest of immortality.
\par Fundamentally its teaching reposes on the assertion of three states of
existence, the human and mortal, the Brahman-consciousness which is the
absolute of our relativities, and the utter Absolute which is unknowable. The
first is in a sense a false status of misrepresentation because it is a continual
term of apparent opposites and balancings where the truth of things is a
secret unity; we have here a bright or positive figure and a dark or negative
figure and both are figures, neither the Truth; still in that we now live and
through that we have to move to the Beyond. The second is the Lord of all
this dual action who is beyond it; He is the truth of Brahman and not in any
way a falsehood or misrepresentation, but the truth of it as attained by us in
our eternal supramental being; in Him are the absolutes of all that here we
experience in partial figures. The Unknowable is beyond our grasp because
though it is the same Reality, yet it exceeds even our highest term of eternal
being and is beyond Existence and Non-existence; it is therefore to the
Brahman, the Lord who has a relation to what we are that we must direct
our search if we would attain beyond what temporarily seems to what
eternally is.
\par The attainment of the Brahman is our escape from the mortal status into
Immortality, by which we understand not the survival of death, but the finding
of our true self of eternal being and
Page 184

bliss beyond the dual symbols of birth and death. By immortality we mean the
absolute life of the soul as opposed to the transient and mutable life in the
body which it assumes by birth and death and rebirth and superior also to its
life as the mere mental being who dwells in the world subjected helplessly to
this law of death and birth or seems at least by his ignorance to be subjected
to this and to other laws of the lower Nature. To know and possess its true
nature, free, absolute, master of itself and its embodiments is the soul's means
of transcendence, and to know and possess this is to know and possess the
Brahman. It is also to rise out of mortal world into immortal world, out of
world of bondage into world of largeness, out of finite world into infinite
world. It is to ascend out of earthly joy and sorrow into a transcendent
Beatitude.
\par This must be done by the abandonment of our attachment to the figure
of things in the mortal world. We must put from us its death and dualities if
we would compass the unity and immortality. Therefore it follows that we
must cease to make the goods of this world or even its right, light and beauty
our object of pursuit; we must go beyond these to a supreme Good, a
transcendent Truth, Light and Beauty in which the opposite figures of what
we call evil disappear. But still, being in this world, it is only through
something in this world itself that we can transcend it; it is through its figures
that we must find the absolute. Therefore, we scrutinise them and perceive
that there are first these forms of mind, life, speech and sense, all of them
figures and imperfect suggestions, and then behind them the cosmic principles
through which the One acts. It is to these cosmic principles that we must
proceed and turn them from their ordinary aim and movement in the world to
find their own supreme aim and absolute movement in their own one
Godhead, the Lord, the Brahman; they must be drawn to leave the workings
of ordinary mind and find the superconscient Mind, to leave the workings of
ordinary speech and sense and find the supramental Sense and original Word,
to leave the apparent workings of mundane Life and find the transcendent
Life.
\par Besides the gods, there is our self, the spirit within who supports all this
action of the gods. Our spirit too must turn from
Page 185

its absorption in its figure of itself as it sees it involved in the movement of
individual life, mind, body and subject to it and must direct its gaze upward to
its own supreme Self who is beyond all this movement and master of it all.
Therefore the mind must indeed become passive to the divine Mind, the
sense to the divine Sense, the life to the divine Life and by receptivity to
constant touches and visitings of the highest be transfigured into a reflection
of these transcendences; but also the individual self must through the mind's
aspiration upwards, through upliftings of itself beyond, through constant
memory of the supreme Reality in which during these divine moments it has
lived, ascend finally into that Bliss and Power and Light.
\par But this will not necessarily mean the immersion into an all-oblivious
Being eternally absorbed in His own inactive self-existence. For the mind,
sense, life going beyond their individual formations find that they are only one
centre of the sole Mind, Life, Form of things and therefore they find
Brahman in that also and not only in an individual transcendence; they bring
down the vision of the superconscient into that also and not only into their
own individual workings. The mind of the individual escapes from its limits
and becomes the one universal mind, his life the one universal life, his bodily
sense the sense of the whole universe and even more as his own indivisible
Brahman-body. He perceives the universe in himself and he perceives also
his self in all existences and knows it to be the one, the omnipresent, the
single-multiple all-inhabiting Lord and Reality. Without this realisation he has
not fulfilled the conditions of immortality. Therefore it is said that what the
sages seek is to distinguish and see the Brahman in all existences; by that
discovery, realisation and possession of Him everywhere and in all they attain
to their immortal existence.
\par Still although the victory of the gods, that is to say, the progressive
perfection of the mind, life, body in the positive terms of good, right, joy,
knowledge, power is recognised as a victory of the Brahman and the
necessity of using life and human works in the world as a means of
preparation and self-mastery is admitted, yet a final passing away into the
infinite heavenly world or status of the Brahman-consciousness is held out as
the goal.
Page 186

And this would seem to imply a rejection of the life of the cosmos. Well then
may we ask, we the modern humanity more and more conscious of the inner
warning of that which created us, be it Nature or God, that there is a work
for the race, a divine purpose in its creation which exceeds the salvation of
the individual soul, because the universal is as real or even more real than the
individual, we who feel more and more, in the language of the Koran, that the
Lord did not create heaven and earth in a jest, that Brahman did not begin
dreaming this world-dream in a moment of aberration and delirium,—well
may we ask whether this gospel of individual salvation is all the message
even of this purer, earlier, more catholic Vedanta. If so, then Vedanta at its
best is a gospel for the saint, the ascetic, the monk, the solitary, but it has not
a message which the widening consciousness of the world can joyfully
accept as the word for which it was waiting. For there is evidently something
vital that has escaped it, a profound word of the riddle of existence from
which it has turned its eyes or which it was unable or thought it not worth
while to solve.
\par Now certainly there is an emphasis in the Upanishads increasing steadily
as time goes on into an over-emphasis, on the salvation of the individual, on
his rejection of the lower cosmic life. This note increases in them as they
become later in date, it swells afterwards into the rejection of all cosmic life
whatever and that becomes finally in later Hinduism almost the one dominant
and all-challenging cry. It does not exist in the earlier Vedic revelation where
individual salvation is regarded as a means towards a great cosmic victory,
the eventual conquest of heaven and earth by the superconscient Truth and
Bliss and those who have achieved the victory in the past are the conscious
helpers of their yet battling posterity. If this earlier note is missing in the
Upanishads, then,—for great as are these Scriptures, luminous, profound,
sublime in their unsurpassed truth, beauty and power, yet it is only the
ignorant soul that will make itself the slave of a book,—then in using them as
an aid to knowledge we must insistently call back that earlier missing note,
we must seek elsewhere a solution for the word of the riddle that has been
ignored. The Upanishad alone of extant scriptures gives us without veil or
stinting, with plenitude and a noble catholicity the truth of the
Page 187

Brahman; its aid to humanity is therefore indispensable. Only, where anything
essential is missing, we must go beyond the Upanishads to seek it,—as for
instance when we add to its emphasis on divine knowledge the indispensable
ardent emphasis of the later teachings upon divine love and the high emphasis
of the Veda upon divine works.
\par The Vedic gospel of a supreme victory in heaven and on earth for the
divine in man, the Christian gospel of a kingdom of God and divine city upon
earth, the Puranic idea of progressing Avataras ending in the kingdom of the
perfect and the restoration of the Golden Age, not only contain behind their
forms a profound truth, but they are necessary to the religious sense in
mankind. Without it the teaching of the vanity of human life and of a
passionate fleeing and renunciation can only be powerful in passing epochs or
else on the few strong souls in each age that are really capable of these
things. The rest of humanity will either reject the creed which makes that its
foundation or ignore it in practice while professing it in precept or else must
sink under the weight of its own impotence and the sense of the illusion of life
or of the curse of God upon the world as mediaeval Christendom sank into
ignorance and obscurantism or later India into stagnant torpor and the
pettiness of a life of aimless egoism. The promise for the individual is well,
but the promise for the race is also needed. Our father Heaven must remain
bright with the hope of deliverance, but also our mother Earth must not feel
herself for ever accursed.
\par It was necessary at one time to insist even exclusively on the idea of
individual salvation so that the sense of a Beyond might be driven into man's
mentality, as it was necessary at one time to insist on a heaven of joys for the
virtuous and pious so that man might be drawn by that shining bait towards
the practice of religion and the suppression of his unbridled animality. But as
the lures of earth have to be conquered, so also have the lures of heaven.
The lure of a pleasant Paradise of the rewards of virtue has been rejected by
man; the Upanishads belittled it ages ago in India and it is now no longer
dominant in the mind of the people; the similar lure in popular Christianity and
popular Islam has no meaning for the conscience of modern humanity.
Page 188

The lure of a release from birth and death and withdrawal from the cosmic
labour must also be rejected, as it was rejected by Mahayanist Buddhism
which held compassion and helpfulness to be greater than Nirvana. As the
virtues we practise must be done without demand of earthly or heavenly
reward, so the salvation we seek must be purely internal and impersonal; it
must be the release from egoism, the union with the Divine, the realisation of
our universality as well as our transcendence, and no salvation should be
valued which takes us away from the love of God in his manifestation and the
help we can give to the world. If need be, it must be taught for a time,
“Better this hell with our other suffering selves than a solitary salvation.”
\par Fortunately, there is no need to go to such lengths and deny one side of
the truth in order to establish another. The Upanishad itself suggests the door
of escape from any over-emphasis in its own statement of the truth. For the
man who knows and possesses the supreme Brahman as the transcendent
Beatitude becomes a centre of that delight to which all his fellows shall come,
a well from which they can draw the divine waters. Here is the clue that we
need. The connection with the universe is preserved for the one reason
which supremely justifies that connection; it must subsist not from the desire
of personal earthly joy, as with those who are still bound, but for help to all
creatures. Two then are the objects of the high-reaching soul, to attain the
Supreme and to be for ever for the good of all the world,—even as Brahman
Himself; whether here or elsewhere, does not essentially matter. Still where
the struggle is thickest, there should be the hero of the spirit, that is surely the
highest choice of the son of Immortality; the earth calls most, because it has
most need of him, to the soul that has become one with the universe.
\par And the nature of the highest good that can be done is also
indicated,—though other lower forms of help are not therefore excluded. To
assist in the lesser victories of the gods which must prepare the supreme
victory of the Brahman may well be and must be in some way or other a part
of our task; but the greatest helpfulness of all is this, to be a human centre of
the Light, the Glory, the Bliss, the Strength, the Knowledge of the Divine
Page 189

Existence, one through whom it shall communicate itself lavishly to other men
and attract by its magnet of delight their souls to that which is the Highest.

stretches everywhere. All this is Brahman alone, all this magnificent

\par{2.} The soul is the bird that sits immersed on the one common

he sees that other who is the Lord and beloved, he knows that all is His
greatness and his sorrow passes away from him.

\par{3.} When, a seer, he sees the Golden-hued, the maker, the Lord,
the Spirit who is the source of Brahman,
\note{Or, “whose source is Brahman”; Shankara admits the other meaning
as an alternative, but explains it as “the source of the lower Brahman”.} then
he becomes the knower and shakes from his wings sin and virtue; pure of all
stain he reaches the supreme identity.
\note{Or, “pure of all staining tinge he reaches to a supreme equality”.}

\par{4.} This is the life in things that shines manifested by all these
beings; a man of knowledge coming wholly to know this, draws back from
creeds and too much disputings. In the

}
\par{5.} The Self can always be won by truth, by self-discipline, by
integral knowledge, by a life of purity,—this Self that is in the inner body,
radiant, made all of light whom, by the perishing of their blemishes, the doers
of askesis behold.

stretched out the path of the journey of the gods, by which the sages winning
their desire ascend there where Truth has its Supreme abode.

\par{7.} Vast is That, divine, its form unthinkable; it shines out subtler
than the subtle:
\note{Or, “minuter than the minute”.} very far and farther than farness, it is
here close to us, for those who have vision it is even here in this world; it is
here, hidden in the secret heart.

\par{8.} Eye cannot seize, speech cannot grasp Him, nor these other
godheads; not by austerity can he be held nor by works: only when the inner
being is purified by a glad serenity of

knowledge, then indeed, meditating, one beholds the Spirit indivisible.

}
\par{9.} This self is subtle and has to be known by a thought-mind into
which the life-force has made its fivefold entry: all the conscious heart of
creatures is shot through and inwoven with the currents of the life-force and
only when it is purified can this Self manifest its power.
\note{The verb \s{vibhavati} seems here to have a complex sense and to
mean, “to manifest its full power and pervading presence”.}

\par{10.} Whatever world the man whose inner being is purified sheds
the light of his mind upon, and whatsoever desires he cherishes, that world he
takes by conquest, and those desires. Then, let whosoever seeks for success

\par{1.} He knows this supreme Brahman as the highest abiding place
in which shines out, inset, the radiant world. The wise who are without desire
and worship the Spirit pass beyond this sperm.
\note{Shankara takes it so in the sense of {\it semen virile,} which is the
cause of birth into the cosmos. But it is possible that it means rather “pass
beyond this brilliant universe”, the radiant world which has just been spoken
of, to the greater Light which is its abiding place and source, the supreme
Brahman.}

\par{2.} He who cherishes desires and his mind dwells with his
longings, is by his desires born again wherever they lead him, but the man
who has won all his desire
\note{Or, “finished with desires”.} and has found his soul, for him even here
in this world vanish away all desires.

\par{3.} This Self is not won by exegesis, nor by brain-power, nor by
much learning of Scripture. Only by him whom It chooses can it be won; to
him this Self unveils its own body.

\par{4.} This Self cannot be won by any who is without strength, nor
with error in the seeking, nor by an askesis without the true mark: but when a
man of knowledge strives by these means his Self enters into Brahman, his
abiding place.

\par{5.} Attaining to him, seers glad with fullness of knowledge,

wise, come to the all-pervading from every side, and, uniting themselves with
him enter utterly the All.

\par{6.} Doers of askesis who have made sure of the aim
\note{Or, “meaning”.} of the whole-knowledge of Vedanta, the inner being
purified by the Yoga of renunciation, all in the hour of their last end passing
beyond death are released into the worlds of the Brahman.

pass into their proper godheads, works and the Self of Knowledge,—all
become one in the Supreme and Imperishable.

\par{8.} As rivers in their flowing reach their home
\note{Or, “come to their end”.} in the ocean and cast off their names and
forms, even so one who knows is delivered from name and form and reaches
the Supreme beyond the Most High, even the Divine Person.
\par

\par{9.} He, verily, who knows that Supreme Brahman becomes
himself Brahman; in his lineage none is born who knows not the Brahman.
He crosses beyond sorrow, he crosses beyond sin, he is delivered from the
knotted cord of the secret heart and becomes immortal.

\par{10.} This is That declared by the Rig-veda. Doers of works,
versed in the Veda, men absorbed in the Brahman, who putting their faith in
the sole-seer offer themselves to him sacrifice,—to them one should speak
this Brahman- Knowledge, men by whom the Vow of the Head has been
done according to the rite.

\ht The Knowledge of Brahman
\par\nodrop
\BF The knower of Brahman reacheth that which is supreme. \nl This is that
verse which was spoken; “Truth, Knowledge, Infinity the Brahman, \nl He
who knoweth that hidden in the secrecy in the supreme ether, \nl Enjoyeth all
desires along with the wise-thinking Brahman.”
\par
\PF This is the burden of the opening sentences of the Taittiriya Upanishad's
second section; they begin its elucidation of the highest truth. Or in the
Sanskrit,
\par
{\it brahmavid \=apnoti param— tad e\,s\=abhyukt\=a—satya\.m j\~n\=anam
ananta\.m brahma— yo veda nihita\.m guh\=ay\=a\.m—parame vyoman— so'\'snute
sarv\=an k\=am\=an—saha brahma\,n\=a vipa\'sciteti, }
\par But what is Brahman?
\par
\PF Whatever reality is in existence, by which all the rest subsists, that is
Brahman. An Eternal behind all instabilities, a Truth of things which is
implied, if it is hidden in all appearances, a Constant which supports all
mutations, but is not increased, diminished, abrogated,—there is such an
unknown {\it x} which makes existence a problem, our own self a mystery,
the universe a riddle. If we were only what we seem to be to our normal
self-awareness, there would be no mystery; if the world were only what it
can be made out to be by the perceptions of the senses and their strict
analysis in the reason, there would be no riddle; and if to take our life as it is
now and the world as it has so far developed to our experience were the
whole possibility of our knowing and doing, there would be no problem. Or at
best there would be but a shallow mystery, an easily solved riddle, the
problem only of a child's puzzle. But there is more, and that more is the
hidden head of the Infinite and the secret heart of the Eternal. It is the
highest and this highest is the all; there is none beyond and there
Page 245

is none other than it. To know it is to know the highest and by knowing the
highest to know all. For as it is the beginning and source of all things, so
everything else is its consequence; as it is the support and constituent of all
things, so the secret of everything else is explained by its secret; as it is the
sum and end of all things, so everything else amounts to it and by throwing
itself into it achieves the sense of its own existence.
\par This is the Brahman.
\par
\tstar 
\par\noindent If this unknown be solely an indecipherable, only indefinable {\it
x}, always unknown and unknowable, the hidden never revealed, the secret
never opened to us, then our mystery would for ever remain a mystery, our
riddle insoluble, our problem intangible. Its existence, even while it determines
all we are, know and do, could yet make no practical difference to us; for our
relation to it would then be a blind and helpless dependence, a relation binding
us to ignorance and maintainable only by that ignorance. Or again, if it be in
some way knowable, but the sole result of knowledge were an extinction or
cessation of our being, then within our being it could have no consequences;
the very act and fructuation of knowledge would bring the annihilation of all
that we now are, not its completion or fulfilment. The mystery, riddle,
problem would not be so much solved as abolished, for it would lose all its
data. In effect we should have to suppose that there is an eternal and
irreconcilable opposition between Brahman and what we now are, between
the supreme cause and all its effects or between the supreme source and all
its derivations. And it would then seem that all that the Eternal originates, all
he supports, all he takes back to himself is a denial or contradiction of his
being which, though in itself a negative of that which alone is, has yet in some
way become a positive. The two could not coexist in consciousness; if he
allowed the world to know him, it would disappear from being.
\par But the Eternal is knowable, He defines himself so that we may seize
him, and man can become, even while he exists as man and in this world and
in this body, a knower of the Brahman.
Page 246

\par The knowledge of the Brahman is not a thing luminous but otiose,
informing to the intellectual view of things but without consequence to the
soul of the individual or his living; it is a knowledge that is a power and a
divine compulsion to change; by it his existence gains something that now he
does not possess in consciousness. What is this gain? it is this that he is
conscious now in a lower state only of his being, but by knowledge he gains
his highest being.
\par The highest state of our being is not a denial, contradiction and
annihilation of all that we now are; it is a supreme accomplishment of all
things that our present existence means and aims at, but in their highest sense
and in the eternal values.
\par
\tstar 
\par\noindent To live in our present state of self-consciousness is to live and
to act in ignorance. We are ignorant of ourselves, because we know as yet
only that in us which changes always, from moment to moment, from hour to
hour, from period to period, from life to life, and not that in us which is
eternal. We are ignorant of the world because we do not know God; we are
aware of the law of appearances, but not of the law and truth of being.
\par Our highest wisdom, our minutest most accurate science, our most
effective application of knowledge can be at most a thinning of the veil of
ignorance, but not a going beyond it, so long as we do not get at the
fundamental knowledge and the consciousness to which that is native. The
rest are effective for their own temporal purposes, but prove ineffective in
the end, because they do not bring to the highest good; they lead to no
permanent solution of the problem of existence.
\par The ignorance in which we live is not a baseless and wholesale
falsehood, but at its lowest the misrepresentation of a Truth, at its highest an
imperfect representation and translation into inferior and to that extent
misleading values. It is a knowledge of the superficial only and therefore a
missing of the secret essential which is the key to all that the superficial is
striving for; a knowledge of the finite and apparent, but a missing of all
Page 247

that the apparent symbolises and the finite suggests; a knowledge of inferior
forms, but a missing of all that our inferior life and being has above it and to
which it must aspire if it is to fulfil its greatest possibilities. The true
knowledge is that of the highest, the inmost, the infinite. The knower of the
Brahman sees all these lower things in the light of the Highest, the external
and superficial as a translation of the internal and essential, the finite from the
view of the Infinite. He begins to see and know existence no longer as the
thinking animal, but as the Eternal sees and knows it. Therefore he is glad
and rich in being, luminous in joy, satisfied of existence.
\par
\tstar 
\par\noindent Knowledge does not end with knowing, nor is it pursued and
found for the sake of knowing alone. It has its full value only when it leads to
some greater gain than itself, some gain of being. Simply to know the eternal
and to remain in the pain, struggle and inferiority of our present way of being,
would be a poor and lame advantage.
\par A greater knowledge opens the possibility and, if really possessed, brings
the actuality of a greater being. To be is the first verb which contains all the
others; knowledge, action, creation, enjoyment are only a fulfilment of being.
Since we are incomplete in being, to grow is our aim, and that knowledge,
action, creation, enjoyment are the best which most help us to expand, grow,
feel our existence.
\par Mere existence is not fullness of being. Being knows itself as power,
consciousness, delight; a greater being means a greater power, consciousness
and delight.
\par If by greater being we incurred only a greater pain and suffering, this
good would not be worth having. Those who say that it is, mean simply that
we get by it a greater sense of fulfilment which brings of itself a greater joy
of the power of existence, and an extension of suffering or a loss of other
enjoyment is worth having as a price for this greater sense of wideness,
height and power. But this could not be the perfection of being or the highest
height of its fulfilment; suffering is the seal of a lower
Page 248

status. The highest consciousness is integrally fulfilled in wideness and power
of its existence, but also it is integrally fulfilled in delight.
\par The knower of Brahman has not only the joy of light, but gains
something immense as the result of his knowledge, \s{brahmavid \=apnoti.}
\par What he gains is that highest, that which is supreme; he gains the highest
being, the highest consciousness, the highest wideness and power of being,
the highest delight; \s{brahmavid \=apnoti param.}
\par
\tstar 
\par\noindent The Supreme is not something aloof and shut up in itself. It is
not a mere indefinable, prisoner of its own featureless absoluteness, impotent
to define, create, know itself variously, eternally buried in a sleep or a swoon
of self-absorption. The Highest is the Infinite and the Infinite contains the All.
Whoever attains the highest consciousness, becomes infinite in being and
embraces the All.
\par To make this clear the Upanishad has defined the Brahman as the Truth,
Knowledge, Infinity and has defined the result of the knowledge of Him in
the secrecy, in the cave of being, in the supreme ether as the enjoyment of all
its desires by the soul of the individual in the attainment of its highest
self-existence.
\par Our highest state of being is indeed a becoming one with Brahman in his
eternity and infinity, but it is also an association with him in delight of
self-fulfilment, \s{a\'snute saha brahma\,n\=a.} And that principle of the Eternal
by which this association is possible, is the principle of his knowledge, his
self-discernment and all-discernment, the wisdom by which he knows himself
perfectly in all the world and all beings, \s{brahma\,n\=a vipa\'scit\=a.}
\par Delight of being is the continent of all the fulfilled values of existence
which we now seek after in the forms of desire. To know its conditions and
possess it purely and perfectly is the infinite privilege of the eternal Wisdom.

\ht Truth, Knowledge, Infinity
\par\drop Truth, Knowledge, Infinity, not as three separate things, but in their
inseparable unity, are the supernal conscious being of the Eternal. It is an
infinite being, an infinite truth of being, an infinite self-knowledge of
self-being. Take one of these away and the idea of the Eternal fails us; we
land ourselves in half-lights, in dark or shining paradoxes without issue or in a
vain exaggeration and apotheosis of isolated intellectual conceptions.
\par Infinity is the timeless and spaceless and causeless infinity of the eternal
containing all the infinities of space and time and the endless succession
which humanly we call causality. But in fact causality is only an inferior
aspect and translation into mental and vital terms of something which is not
mechanical causality, but the harmonies of a free self-determination of the
being of the Eternal.
\par Truth is truth of the infinite and eternal, truth of being, and truth of
becoming only as a self-expression of the being. The circumstances of the
self-expression appear to the mind as the finite, but nothing is really finite
except the way the mind has of experiencing all that appears to its view. All
things are, each thing is the Brahman.
\par Knowledge is the Eternal's inalienable self-knowledge of his infinite
self-existence and of all its truth and reality and, in that truth, of all things as
seen not by the mind, but by the self-view of the Spirit. This knowledge is not
possible to the mind; it can only be reflected inadequately by it when it is
touched by a ray from the secret luminous cavern of our superconscient
being; yet of that ray we can make a shining ladder to climb into the source
of this supreme self-viewing wisdom.
\par To know the eternal Truth, Knowledge, Infinity is to know the Brahman.

\ht Note on the Texts
\par\nodrop
\text The translations and commentaries published here represent Sri
Aurobindo's Upanishadic interpretation in its most mature and finished form.
They include the final versions of his translations of the Isha, Kena, Mundaka
and Katha Upanishads, complete commentaries on the Isha and Kena
Upanishads, and a commentary on part of the Taittiriya Upanishad. Sri
Aurobindo wrote all these texts after he settled in Pondicherry in 1910.
Translations and commentaries written before that date or left incomplete
have been omitted. Such texts, which are of considerable value to students of
Sri Aurobindo's thought, are available in other publications.
\par Sri Aurobindo began his work on the Upanishads in Baroda around 1900.
Between then and 1910 he wrote complete translations of eight Upanishads,
incomplete commentaries on the Isha, Kena and others, and several
incomplete expository works on the philosophy of the Upanishads. After
settling in Pondicherry he continued this work, concentrating as before mostly
on the Isha Upanishad. Between 1914 and 1920 he published his final
versions of his translations of the Isha, Kena and Mundaka, and the
“Readings in the Taittiriya Upanishad”. Somewhat earlier, he had revised
most of his translation of the Katha Upanishad. Further information on these
works is given below.
\par
\PF{\ftextb Introduction.} This is not an independent work, but Chapter XVII
of {\it A Defence of Indian Culture}, first published in the monthly review {\it
Arya} in June 1920. It has been included here by the editors to serve as an
introduction to the translations and commentaries.
\par
\PF{\ftextb Isha Upanishad.} Translation and analysis published in the {\it
Arya} between August 1914 and May 1915. Published as a book by the
Arya Publishing House, Calcutta, in 1921. A second, slightly revised edition,
brought out in 1924 and reprinted in 1941 and 1945 by the same publishers.
The same text reprinted many of times since then, both separately and in
other books, notably {\it Eight Upanishads} (1953) and {\it The Upanishads}
(1972 and subsequently).
\par
\PF{\ftextb Kena Upanishad.} Translation and commentary published in the
{\it Arya} between June 1915 and July 1916. Lightly revised sometime
between 1916 and 1920, but never reprinted during Sri Aurobindo's lifetime.
Revised translation first printed in 1970; revised commentary first printed in
1981.
\par
\PF{\ftextb Mundaka Upanishad.} Translation published in the {\it Arya}
between in November and December 1920. Revised during the late 1940s.
Revised translation published in {\it Eight Upanishads} in 1953 and
subsequently.
\par
\PF{\ftextb Katha Upanishad.} Translation published in the {\it Karmayogin}
in July and August 1909. Incompletely revised some years later in
Pondicherry. The revised version published posthumously in 1952 and
subsequently.
\par
\PF{\ftextb Readings in the Taittiriya Upanishad.} First part published in the
{\it Arya} in November 1918. Second part apparently written immediately
afterwards but never published during Sri Aurobindo's lifetime. First part
republished in {\it The Upanishads} in 1972; second part first published in the
1981 edition.

\ht The Present Text
\par The present text of all the pieces in this publication is that of the second
edition of {\it The Upanishads} (1981). A new edition of Sri Aurobindo's
work is under preparation and will appear in two volumes of {\fsc The
Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo}: {\it Isha Upanishad} and {\it Kena and
Other Upanishads.}
