        <title>Publisher's Note</title>
        <para>The writing of 
            <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> extended over much of the later part of Sri Aurobindo's life. The earliest known manuscript is dated 1916. The original narrative poem was recast several times in the first phase of composition. By around 1930, Sri Aurobindo had begun to turn it into an epic with a larger scope and deeper significance.</para>
        <para>
            Transformed into "A Legend and a Symbol", 
            <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> became his major literary work which he continued to expand and perfect until his last days. In the late 1940s, when his eyesight was failing, he took the help of a scribe and dictated the extensive final stages of revision.

        <para>
            Separate cantos started to appear in print in 1946. Part One of the first edition was published in 1950. The next year, after Sri Aurobindo's passing, the rest of the poem was brought out in a second volume.
        </para>
        <para>
            In the second edition (1954), Sri Aurobindo's letters on 
            <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> were added. They are omitted from the present edition and included in 
            <emphasis>Letters on Poetry and Art</emphasis>.
        </para>
        <para>
            In 1970 
            <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> was published as volumes 28 and 29 of the Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library. This edition was reprinted, as a single volume, a number of times between 1973 and 1990.
        </para>
        <para>
            The fourth ("revised") edition appeared in 1993. This edition was the outcome of a systematic comparison of the printed text of 
            <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> with the manuscripts. The 1993 edition has been reprinted several times. In 1997 it was published as volumes 33 and 34 of the CWSA.
        </para>
        <para>
            The text of the present, electronic, edition (1999) is identical to the text of the CWSA edition. As the page breaks in the CWSA edition are almost everywhere identical to the page breaks in the SABCL edition, the SABCL page numbers have not been given separately for this book.

        <title>Author's Note</title>
        <para>The tale of Satyavan and Savitri is recited in the Mahabharata as a story of conjugal love conquering death. But this legend is, as shown by many features of the human tale, one of the many symbolic myths of the Vedic cycle. Satyavan is the soul carrying the divine truth of being within itself but descended into the grip of death and ignorance; Savitri is the Divine Word, daughter of the Sun, goddess of the supreme Truth who comes down and is born to save; Aswapati, the Lord of the Horse, her human father, is the Lord of Tapasya, the concentrated energy of spiritual endeavour that helps us to rise from the mortal to the immortal planes; Dyumatsena, Lord of the Shining Hosts, father of Satyavan, is the Divine Mind here fallen blind, losing its celestial kingdom of vision, and through that loss its kingdom of glory. Still this is not a mere allegory, the characters are not personified qualities, but incarnations or emanations of living and conscious Forces with whom we can enter into concrete touch and they take human bodies in order to help man and show him the way from his mortal state to a divine consciousness and immortal life.</para>

                       <member>The impassive skies were neutral, empty, still.</member>

                       <member>A throe that came and left a quivering trace,</member>
                       <member>Gave room for an old tired want unfilled,</member>
                       <member>At peace in its subconscient moonless cave</member>
                       <member>To raise its head and look for absent light,</member>
                       <member>Straining closed eyes of vanished memory,</member>
                       <member>Like one who searches for a bygone self</member>
                       <member>And only meets the corpse of his desire.</member>
                       <member>It was as though even in this Nought's profound,</member>
                       <member>Even in this ultimate dissolution's core,</member>
                       <member>There lurked an unremembering entity,</member>

                       <member>Condemned to resume the effort and the pang,</member>
                       <member>Reviving in another frustrate world.</member>
                       <member>An unshaped consciousness desired light</member>
                       <member>And a blank prescience yearned towards distant change.</member>
                       <member>As if a childlike finger laid on a cheek</member>

                       <member>The heedless Mother of the universe,</member>
                       <member>An infant longing clutched the sombre Vast.</member>
                       <member>Insensibly somewhere a breach began:</member>
                       <member>A long lone line of hesitating hue</member>
                       <member>Like a vague smile tempting a desert heart</member>
                       <member>Troubled the far rim of life's obscure sleep.</member>
                       <member>Arrived from the other side of boundlessness</member>
                       <member>An eye of deity peered through the dumb deeps;</member>
                       <member>A scout in a reconnaissance from the sun,</member>
                       <member>It seemed amid a heavy cosmic rest,</member>
                       <member>The torpor of a sick and weary world,</member>
                       <member>To seek for a spirit sole and desolate</member>
                       <member>Too fallen to recollect forgotten bliss.</member>
                       <member>Intervening in a mindless universe,</member>
                       <member>Its message crept through the reluctant hush</member>
                       <member>Calling the adventure of consciousness and joy</member>
                       <member>And, conquering Nature's disillusioned breast,</member>
                       <member>Compelled renewed consent to see and feel.</member>
                       <member>A thought was sown in the unsounded Void,</member>
                       <member>A sense was born within the darkness' depths,</member>
                       <member>A memory quivered in the heart of Time</member>
                       <member>As if a soul long dead were moved to live:</member>
                       <member>But the oblivion that succeeds the fall,</member>
                       <member>Had blotted the crowded tablets of the past,</member>
                       <member>And all that was destroyed must be rebuilt</member>
                       <member>And old experience laboured out once more.</member>
                       <member>All can be done if the god-touch is there.</member>
                       <member>A hope stole in that hardly dared to be</member>
                       <member>Amid the Night's forlorn indifference.</member>
                       <member>As if solicited in an alien world</member>
                       <member>With timid and hazardous instinctive grace,</member>
                       <member>Orphaned and driven out to seek a home,</member>
                       <member>An errant marvel with no place to live,</member>
                       <member>Into a far-off nook of heaven there came</member>
                       <member>A slow miraculous gesture's dim appeal.</member>
                       <member>The persistent thrill of a transfiguring touch</member>
                       <member>Persuaded the inert black quietude</member>
                       <member>And beauty and wonder disturbed the fields of God.</member>
                       <member>A wandering hand of pale enchanted light</member>
                       <member>That glowed along a fading moment's brink,</member>
                       <member>Fixed with gold panel and opalescent hinge</member>
                       <member>A gate of dreams ajar on mystery's verge.</member>
                       <member>One lucent corner windowing hidden things</member>
                       <member>Forced the world's blind immensity to sight.</member>
                       <member>The darkness failed and slipped like a falling cloak</member>
                       <member>From the reclining body of a god.</member>
                       <member>Then through the pallid rift that seemed at first</member>
                       <member>Hardly enough for a trickle from the suns,</member>
                       <member>Outpoured the revelation and the flame.</member>
                       <member>The brief perpetual sign recurred above.</member>
                       <member>A glamour from unreached transcendences</member>
                       <member>Iridescent with the glory of the Unseen,</member>
                       <member>A message from the unknown immortal Light</member>
                       <member>Ablaze upon creation's quivering edge,</member>
                       <member>Dawn built her aura of magnificent hues</member>
                       <member>And buried its seed of grandeur in the hours.</member>
                       <member>An instant's visitor the godhead shone.</member>
                       <member>On life's thin border awhile the Vision stood</member>
                       <member>And bent over earth's pondering forehead curve.</member>
                       <member>Interpreting a recondite beauty and bliss</member>
                       <member>In colour's hieroglyphs of mystic sense,</member>
                       <member>It wrote the lines of a significant myth</member>
                       <member>Telling of a greatness of spiritual dawns,</member>
                       <member>A brilliant code penned with the sky for page.</member>
                       <member>Almost that day the epiphany was disclosed</member>
                       <member>Of which our thoughts and hopes are signal flares;</member>
                       <member>A lonely splendour from the invisible goal</member>
                       <member>Almost was flung on the opaque Inane.</member>
                       <member>Once more a tread perturbed the vacant Vasts;</member>

                       <member>The omniscient Goddess leaned across the breadths</member>
                       <member>That wrap the fated journeyings of the stars</member>
                       <member>And saw the spaces ready for her feet.</member>
                       <member>Once she half looked behind for her veiled sun,</member>

                       <member>Earth felt the Imperishable's passage close:</member>
                       <member>The waking ear of Nature heard her steps</member>

                       <member>Kindled to fire the silence of the worlds.</member>
                       <member>All grew a consecration and a rite.</member>
                       <member>Air was a vibrant link between earth and heaven;</member>

                       <member>A search for something or someone never found,</member>
                       <member>Cult of an ideal never made real here,</member>

                       <member>Annulled the soul's treaty with Nature's nescience.</member>
                       <member>All the grey inhibitions were torn off</member>

                       <member>A low muttering rose from the subconscient caves,</member>
                       <member>The stammer of the primal ignorance;</member>
                       <member>Answer to that inarticulate questioning,</member>

                       <member>A radiant hymn to the Inexpressible</member>

                       <member>Vision and dream were fables spoken by truth</member>

                       <member>Or were truths enforced by supernatural seals.</member>
                       <member>Immortal eyes approached and looked in his,</member>

                       <member>Could leave their glory beyond death and birth</member>
                       <member>To utter the wisdom which exceeds all phrase:</member>
                       <member>The kings of evil and the kings of good,</member>

                       <member>Proclaimed the gospel of their opposites,</member>
                       <member>And all believed themselves spokesmen of God:</member>

                       <member>Battled for his soul as for a costly prize.</member>
                       <member>In every hour loosed from the quiver of Time</member>
                       <member>There rose a song of new discovery,</member>
                       <member>A bow-twang's hum of young experiment.</member>
                       <member>Each day was a spiritual romance,</member>

                       <member>Adventure leaped an unexpected friend,</member>

                       <member>Each happening was a deep experience.</member>
                       <member>There were high encounters, epic colloquies,</member>
                       <member>And counsels came couched in celestial speech,</member>
                       <member>And honeyed pleadings breathed from occult lips</member>
                       <member>To help the heart to yield to rapture's call,</member>

                       <member>The touch replied to subtle infinities,</member>

                       <member>Sight's lightnings leaped into the invisible.</member>
                       <member>Ever his consciousness and vision grew;</member>

                       <member>And passed the zone where thought replaces life.</member>
                       <member>Out of this world of signs suddenly he came</member>
                       <member>Into a silent self where world was not</member>
                       <member>And looked beyond into a nameless vast.</member>
                       <member>These symbol figures lost their right to live,</member>
                       <member>All tokens dropped our sense can recognise;</member>
                       <member>There the heart beat no more at body's touch,</member>
                       <member>There the eyes gazed no more on beauty's shape.</member>
                       <member>In rare and lucent intervals of hush</member>
                       <member>Into a signless region he could soar</member>
                       <member>Packed with the deep contents of formlessness</member>
                       <member>Where world was into a single being rapt</member>
                       <member>And all was known by the light of identity</member>
                       <member>And Spirit was its own self-evidence.</member>
                       <member>The Supreme's gaze looked out through human eyes</member>
                       <member>And saw all things and creatures as itself</member>

                       <member>There unity is too close for search and clasp</member>
                       <member>And love is a yearning of the One for the One,</member>
                       <member>And beauty is a sweet difference of the Same</member>
                       <member>And oneness is the soul of multitude.</member>

                       <member>Wisdom supernal, wordless, absolute</member>
                       <member>Sat uncompanioned in the eternal Calm,</member>
                       <member>All-seeing, motionless, sovereign and alone.</member>
                       <member>There knowledge needs not words to embody Idea;</member>
                       <member>Idea, seeking a house in boundlessness,</member>
                       <member>Weary of its homeless immortality,</member>
                       <member>Asks not in thought's carved brilliant cell to rest</member>

                       <member>Sees only a little arc of God's vast sky.</member>
                       <member>The boundless with the boundless there consorts;</member>
                       <member>While there, one can be wider than the world;</member>

                       <member>His centre was no more in earthly mind;</member>
                       <member>A power of seeing silence filled his limbs:</member>
                       <member>Caught by a voiceless white epiphany</member>
                       <member>Into a vision that surpasses forms,</member>
                       <member>Into a living that surpasses life,</member>
                       <member>He neared the still consciousness sustaining all.</member>
                       <member>The voice that only by speech can move the mind</member>
                       <member>Became a silent knowledge in the soul;</member>
                       <member>The strength that only in action feels its truth</member>
                       <member>Was lodged now in a mute omnipotent peace.</member>
                       <member>A leisure in the labour of the worlds,</member>

                       <member>In the tremendous shock that lights a star</member>
                       <member>As in the building of a grain of dust,</member>
                       <member>The grooves that turn their dumb ellipse in space</member>
                       <member>Ploughed by the seeking of the world's desire,</member>
                       <member>The long regurgitations of Time's flood,</member>
                       <member>The torment edging the dire force of lust</member>

                       <member>And carves a personality out of mud,</member>

                       <member>The oestrus which creates with fire of pain,</member>
                       <member>The fate that punishes virtue with defeat,</member>
                       <member>The tragedy that destroys long happiness,</member>

                       <member>His soul stood free, a witness and a king.</member>
                       <member>Absorbed no more in the moment-ridden flux</member>
                       <member>Where mind incessantly drifts as on a raft</member>
                       <member>Hurried from phenomenon to phenomenon,</member>
                       <member>He abode at rest in indivisible Time.</member>

                       <member>And saw the hours like dots upon a page.</member>
                       <member>An aspect of the unknown Reality</member>

                       <member>Across a void retreating sky he glimpsed</member>

                       <member>For the slow footsteps of far Destiny</member>

                       <member>To be seemed only a long experiment,</member>
                       <member>The hazard of a seeking ignorant Force</member>

                       <member>Amid a tedious crawl of drab desires</member>

                       <member>Amid her swift untold variety</member>
                       <member>Something remained dissatisfied, ever the same</member>

                       <member>For every hour repeated all the rest</member>

                       <member>A perverse savour haunts her thirsting lips:</member>

                       <member>Insensible foundation of a world</member>

                       <member>A dim and dreadful muteness fell on her:</member>

                       <member>Thought was withheld and nothing now she knew,</member>

                       <member>Inflicting on the body desire and hope,</member>
                       <member>Imposing on inconscience consciousness,</member>
                       <member>She brought into Matter's dull tenacity</member>
                       <member>Her anguished claim to her lost sovereign right,</member>
                       <member>Her tireless search, her vexed uneasy heart,</member>
                       <member>Her wandering unsure steps, her cry for change.</member>
                       <member>Adorer of a joy without a name,</member>
                       <member>In her obscure cathedral of delight</member>
                       <member>To dim dwarf gods she offers secret rites.</member>
                       <member>But vain unending is the sacrifice,</member>
                       <member>The priest an ignorant mage who only makes</member>
                       <member>Futile mutations in the altar's plan</member>
                       <member>And casts blind hopes into a powerless flame.</member>
                       <member>A burden of transient gains weighs down her steps</member>
                       <member>And hardly under that load can she advance;</member>

                       <member>Her greatest progress is a deepened need.</member>
                       <member>Matter dissatisfies, she turns to Mind;</member>
                       <member>She conquers earth, her field, then claims the heavens.</member>
                       <member>Insensible, breaking the work she has done</member>
                       <member>The stumbling ages over her labour pass,</member>
                       <member>But still no great transforming light came down</member>
                       <member>And no revealing rapture touched her fall.</member>
                       <member>Only a glimmer sometimes splits mind's sky</member>
                       <member>Justifying the ambiguous providence</member>
                       <member>That makes of night a path to unknown dawns</member>
                       <member>Or a dark clue to some diviner state.</member>

                       <member>There was a voice of busy interchange,</member>

                       <member>And the opportunities of cosmic Space.</member>
                       <member>This creature passionate only to survive,</member>

                       <member>Only it hoped for greatness in its den</member>
                       <member>And pleasure and victory in small fields of power</member>
                       <member>And conquest of life-room for self and kin,</member>
                       <member>An animal limited by its feeding-space.</member>

                       <member>In the same circle of interest and desire,</member>
                       <member>But thought itself the master of its jail.</member>

                       <member>Mind grew to a clarity cut out, precise,</member>
                       <member>A gleam enclosed in a stone ignorance.</member>

                       <member>Yet conscious of some light prompting his soul.</member>

                       <member>He sought his way amid life's laughter and call</member>
                       <member>And the index chaos of her myriad steps</member>
                       <member>Towards some total deep infinitude.</member>
                       <member>Around crowded the forest of her signs:</member>
                       <member>At hazard he read by arrow-leaps of Thought</member>
                       <member>That hit the mark by guess or luminous chance,</member>
                       <member>Her changing coloured road-lights of idea</member>
                       <member>And her signals of uncertain swift event,</member>
                       <member>The hieroglyphs of her symbol pageantries</member>
                       <member>And her landmarks in the tangled paths of Time.</member>
                       <member>In her mazes of approach and of retreat</member>
                       <member>To every side she draws him and repels,</member>

                       <member>All ways she leads him but no way is sure.</member>
                       <member>Allured by the many-toned marvel of her chant,</member>

                       <member>And moved by her casual touch to joy and grief,</member>

                       <member>A fugitive paradise smiles at him from her eyes:</member>

                       <member>But miss the luminous answer of the soul.</member>
                       <member>A blind heart-throb that reaches joy through tears,</member>

                       <member>Piled always half-attempts on lost attempts</member>
                       <member>And saw a fragment as the eternal Whole.</member>
                       <member>In the aimless mounting total of things done</member>
                       <member>Existence seemed a vain necessity's act,</member>
                       <member>A wrestle of eternal opposites</member>
                       <member>In a clasped antagonism's close-locked embrace,</member>
                       <member>A play without denouement or idea,</member>
                       <member>A hunger march of lives without a goal,</member>
                       <member>Or, written on a bare blackboard of Space,</member>
                       <member>A futile and recurring sum of souls,</member>
                       <member>A hope that failed, a light that never shone,</member>
                       <member>The labour of an unaccomplished Force</member>
                       <member>Tied to its acts in a dim eternity.</member>
                       <member>There is no end or none can yet be seen:</member>
                       <member>Although defeated, life must struggle on;</member>
                       <member>Always she sees a crown she cannot grasp;</member>
                       <member>Her eyes are fixed beyond her fallen state.</member>
                       <member>There quivers still within her breast and ours</member>
                       <member>A glory that was once and is no more,</member>
                       <member>Or there calls to us from some unfulfilled beyond</member>
                       <member>A greatness yet unreached by the halting world.</member>
                       <member>In a memory behind our mortal sense</member>
                       <member>A dream persists of larger happier air</member>
                       <member>Breathing around free hearts of joy and love,</member>
                       <member>Forgotten by us, immortal in lost Time.</member>
                       <member>A ghost of bliss pursues her haunted depths;</member>
                       <member>For she remembers still, though now so far,</member>
                       <member>Her realm of golden ease and glad desire</member>
                       <member>And the beauty and strength and happiness that were hers</member>
                       <member>In the sweetness of her glowing paradise,</member>
                       <member>In her kingdom of immortal ecstasy</member>
                       <member>Half-way between God's silence and the Abyss.</member>
                       <member>This knowledge in our hidden parts we keep;</member>
                       <member>Awake to a vague mystery's appeal,</member>
                       <member>We meet a deep unseen Reality</member>
                       <member>Far truer than the world's face of present truth:</member>
                       <member>We are chased by a self we cannot now recall</member>
                       <member>And moved by a Spirit we must still become.</member>
                       <member>As one who has lost the kingdom of his soul,</member>
                       <member>We look back to some god-phase of our birth</member>
                       <member>Other than this imperfect creature here</member>
                       <member>And hope in this or a diviner world</member>
                       <member>To recover yet from Heaven's patient guard</member>
                       <member>What by our mind's forgetfulness we miss,</member>
                       <member>Our being's natural felicity,</member>
                       <member>Our heart's delight we have exchanged for grief,</member>
                       <member>The body's thrill we bartered for mere pain,</member>
                       <member>The bliss for which our mortal nature yearns</member>
                       <member>As yearns an obscure moth to blazing Light.</member>
                       <member>Our life is a march to a victory never won.</member>
                       <member>This wave of being longing for delight,</member>
                       <member>This eager turmoil of unsatisfied strengths,</member>
                       <member>These long far files of forward-striving hopes</member>
                       <member>Lift worshipping eyes to the blue Void called heaven</member>
                       <member>Looking for the golden Hand that never came,</member>
                       <member>The advent for which all creation waits,</member>
                       <member>The beautiful visage of Eternity</member>
                       <member>That shall appear upon the roads of Time.</member>
                       <member>Yet still to ourselves we say rekindling faith,</member>
                       <member>"Oh, surely one day he shall come to our cry,</member>
                       <member>One day he shall create our life anew</member>
                       <member>And utter the magic formula of peace</member>
                       <member>And bring perfection to the scheme of things.</member>
                       <member>One day he shall descend to life and earth,</member>
                       <member>Leaving the secrecy of the eternal doors,</member>
                       <member>Into a world that cries to him for help,</member>
                       <member>And bring the truth that sets the spirit free,</member>
                       <member>The joy that is the baptism of the soul,</member>
                       <member>The strength that is the outstretched arm of Love.</member>
                       <member>One day he shall lift his beauty's dreadful veil,</member>
                       <member>Impose delight on the world's beating heart</member>
                       <member>And bare his secret body of light and bliss."</member>
                       <member>But now we strain to reach an unknown goal:</member>
                       <member>There is no end of seeking and of birth,</member>
                       <member>There is no end of dying and return;</member>
                       <member>The life that wins its aim asks greater aims,</member>
                       <member>The life that fails and dies must live again;</member>
                       <member>Till it has found itself it cannot cease.</member>
                       <member>All must be done for which life and death were made.</member>
                       <member>But who shall say that even then is rest?</member>
                       <member>Or there repose and action are the same</member>
                       <member>In the deep breast of God's supreme delight.</member>
                       <member>In a high state where ignorance is no more,</member>
                       <member>Each movement is a wave of peace and bliss,</member>
                       <member>Repose God's motionless creative force,</member>
                       <member>Action a ripple in the Infinite</member>
                       <member>And birth a gesture of Eternity.</member>
                       <member>A sun of transfiguration still can shine</member>
                       <member>And Night can bare its core of mystic light;</member>
                       <member>The self-cancelling, self-afflicting paradox</member>
                       <member>Into a self-luminous mystery might change,</member>
                       <member>The imbroglio into a joyful miracle.</member>
                       <member>Then God could be visible here, here take a shape;</member>
                       <member>Disclosed would be the spirit's identity;</member>
                       <member>Life would reveal her true immortal face.</member>
                       <member>But now a termless labour is her fate:</member>
                       <member>In its recurrent decimal of events</member>
                       <member>Birth, death are a ceaseless iteration's points;</member>
                       <member>The old question-mark margins each finished page,</member>
                       <member>Each volume of her effort's history.</member>
                       <member>A limping Yes through the aeons journeys still</member>

                       <member>Impassive turns the ever-circling Wheel,</member>
                       <member>Life has no issue, death brings no release.</member>
                       <member>A prisoner of itself the being lives</member>
                       <member>And keeps its futile immortality;</member>
                       <member>Extinction is denied, its sole escape.</member>
                       <member>An error of the gods has made the world.</member>

                       <member>From a stark ridge overlooking all that is,</member>

                       <member>Behind appeared a grey carved mask of Night</member>
                       <member>Watching the birth of all created things.</member>
                       <member>A hidden Puissance conscious of its force,</member>

                       <member>No form was seen, yet a dire work was done,</member>
                       <member>An iron decree in crooked uncials written</member>
                       <member>Imposed a law of sin and adverse fate.</member>
                       <member>Life looked at him with changed and sombre eyes:</member>
                       <member>Her beauty he saw and the yearning heart in things</member>
                       <member>That with a little happiness is content,</member>
                       <member>Answering to a small ray of truth or love;</member>
                       <member>He saw her gold sunlight and her far blue sky,</member>
                       <member>Her green of leaves and hue and scent of flowers</member>
                       <member>And the charm of children and the love of friends</member>
                       <member>And the beauty of women and kindly hearts of men,</member>
                       <member>But saw too the dreadful Powers that drive her moods</member>
                       <member>And the anguish she has strewn upon her ways,</member>
                       <member>Fate waiting on the unseen steps of men</member>
                       <member>And her evil and sorrow and last gift of death.</member>
                       <member>A breath of disillusion and decadence</member>
                       <member>Corrupting watched for Life's maturity</member>
                       <member>And made to rot the full grain of the soul:</member>
                       <member>Progress became a purveyor of Death.</member>
                       <member>A world that clung to the law of a slain Light</member>

                       <member>That pleased and helped to enjoy its bitter taste.</member>
                       <member>Of such fierce stuff was made up life's long hell:</member>
                       <member>These were the threads of the dark spider's-web</member>
                       <member>In which the soul was caught, quivering and rapt;</member>
                       <member>This was religion, this was Nature's rule.</member>
                       <member>In a fell chapel of iniquity</member>
                       <member>To worship a black pitiless image of Power</member>
                       <member>Kneeling one must cross hard-hearted stony courts,</member>
                       <member>A pavement like a floor of evil fate.</member>
                       <member>Each stone was a keen edge of ruthless force</member>
                       <member>And glued with the chilled blood from tortured breasts;</member>
                       <member>The dry gnarled trees stood up like dying men</member>
                       <member>Stiffened into a pose of agony,</member>
                       <member>And from each window peered an ominous priest</member>
                       <member>Chanting Te Deums for slaughter's crowning grace,</member>
                       <member>Uprooted cities, blasted human homes,</member>
                       <member>Burned writhen bodies, the bombshell's massacre.</member>
                       <member>"Our enemies are fallen, are fallen," they sang,</member>
                       <member>"All who once stayed our will are smitten and dead;</member>
                       <member>How great we are, how merciful art Thou."</member>
                       <member>Thus thought they to reach God's impassive throne</member>
                       <member>And Him command whom all their acts opposed,</member>
                       <member>Magnifying their deeds to touch his skies,</member>
                       <member>And make him an accomplice of their crimes.</member>
                       <member>There no relenting pity could have place,</member>
                       <member>But ruthless strength and iron moods had sway,</member>
                       <member>A dateless sovereignty of terror and gloom:</member>
                       <member>This took the figure of a darkened God</member>
                       <member>Revered by the racked wretchedness he had made,</member>
                       <member>Who held in thrall a miserable world,</member>
                       <member>And helpless hearts nailed to unceasing woe</member>
                       <member>Adored the feet that trampled them into mire.</member>
                       <member>It was a world of sorrow and of hate,</member>
                       <member>Sorrow with hatred for its lonely joy,</member>
                       <member>Hatred with others' sorrow as its feast;</member>
                       <member>A bitter rictus curled the suffering mouth;</member>
                       <member>A tragic cruelty saw its ominous chance.</member>
                       <member>Hate was the black archangel of that realm;</member>
                       <member>It glowed, a sombre jewel in the heart</member>
                       <member>Burning the soul with its malignant rays,</member>
                       <member>And wallowed in its fell abysm of might.</member>
                       <member>These passions even objects seemed to exude,—</member>
                       <member>For mind overflowed into the inanimate</member>
                       <member>That answered with the wickedness it received,—</member>
                       <member>Against their users used malignant powers,</member>
                       <member>Hurt without hands and strangely, suddenly slew,</member>
                       <member>Appointed as instruments of an unseen doom.</member>
                       <member>Or they made themselves a fateful prison wall</member>
                       <member>Where men condemned wake through the creeping hours</member>
                       <member>Counted by the tollings of an ominous bell.</member>
                       <member>An evil environment worsened evil souls:</member>
                       <member>All things were conscious there and all perverse.</member>
                       <member>In this infernal realm he dared to press</member>
                       <member>Even into its deepest pit and darkest core,</member>
                       <member>Perturbed its tenebrous base, dared to contest</member>
                       <member>Its ancient privileged right and absolute force:</member>
                       <member>In Night he plunged to know her dreadful heart,</member>
                       <member>In Hell he sought the root and cause of Hell.</member>
                       <member>Its anguished gulfs opened in his own breast;</member>
                       <member>He listened to clamours of its crowded pain,</member>
                       <member>The heart-beats of its fatal loneliness.</member>
                       <member>Above was a chill deaf eternity.</member>
                       <member>In vague tremendous passages of Doom</member>
                       <member>He heard the goblin Voice that guides to slay,</member>
                       <member>And faced the enchantments of the demon Sign,</member>
                       <member>And traversed the ambush of the opponent Snake.</member>
                       <member>In menacing tracts, in tortured solitudes</member>
                       <member>Companionless he roamed through desolate ways</member>
                       <member>Where the red Wolf waits by the fordless stream</member>
                       <member>And Death's black eagles scream to the precipice,</member>
                       <member>And met the hounds of bale who hunt men's hearts</member>
                       <member>Baying across the veldts of Destiny,</member>
                       <member>In footless battlefields of the Abyss</member>
                       <member>Fought shadowy combats in mute eyeless depths,</member>
                       <member>Assaults of Hell endured and Titan strokes</member>
                       <member>And bore the fierce inner wounds that are slow to heal.</member>
                       <member>A prisoner of a hooded magic Force,</member>
                       <member>Captured and trailed in Falsehood's lethal net</member>
                       <member>And often strangled in the noose of grief,</member>
                       <member>Or cast in the grim morass of swallowing doubt,</member>
                       <member>Or shut into pits of error and despair,</member>
                       <member>He drank her poison draughts till none was left.</member>
                       <member>In a world where neither hope nor joy could come</member>
                       <member>The ordeal he suffered of evil's absolute reign,</member>
                       <member>Yet kept intact his spirit's radiant truth.</member>
                       <member>Incapable of motion or of force,</member>
                       <member>In Matter's blank denial gaoled and blind,</member>
                       <member>Pinned to the black inertia of our base</member>
                       <member>He treasured between his hands his flickering soul.</member>
                       <member>His being ventured into mindless Void,</member>
                       <member>Intolerant gulfs that knew not thought nor sense;</member>
                       <member>Thought ceased, sense failed, his soul still saw and knew.</member>
                       <member>In atomic parcellings of the Infinite</member>
                       <member>Near to the dumb beginnings of lost Self,</member>
                       <member>He felt the curious small futility</member>
                       <member>Of the creation of material things.</member>
                       <member>Or, stifled in the Inconscient's hollow dusk,</member>
                       <member>He sounded the mystery dark and bottomless</member>
                       <member>Of the enormous and unmeaning deeps</member>
                       <member>Whence struggling life in a dead universe rose.</member>
                       <member>There in the stark identity lost by mind</member>
                       <member>He felt the sealed sense of the insensible world</member>
                       <member>And a mute wisdom in the unknowing Night.</member>
                       <member>Into the abysmal secrecy he came</member>
                       <member>Where darkness peers from her mattress, grey and nude,</member>
                       <member>And stood on the last locked subconscient's floor</member>
                       <member>Where Being slept unconscious of its thoughts</member>
                       <member>And built the world not knowing what it built.</member>
                       <member>There waiting its hour the future lay unknown,</member>
                       <member>There is the record of the vanished stars.</member>
                       <member>There in the slumber of the cosmic Will</member>
                       <member>He saw the secret key of Nature's change.</member>
                       <member>A light was with him, an invisible hand</member>
                       <member>Was laid upon the error and the pain</member>
                       <member>Till it became a quivering ecstasy,</member>
                       <member>The shock of sweetness of an arm's embrace.</member>
                       <member>He saw in Night the Eternal's shadowy veil,</member>
                       <member>Knew death for a cellar of the house of life,</member>
                       <member>In destruction felt creation's hasty pace,</member>
                       <member>Knew loss as the price of a celestial gain</member>
                       <member>And hell as a short cut to heaven's gates.</member>
                       <member>Then in Illusion's occult factory</member>
                       <member>And in the Inconscient's magic printing-house</member>
                       <member>Torn were the formats of the primal Night</member>
                       <member>And shattered the stereotypes of Ignorance.</member>
                       <member>Alive, breathing a deep spiritual breath,</member>
                       <member>Nature expunged her stiff mechanical code</member>
                       <member>And the articles of the bound soul's contract,</member>
                       <member>Falsehood gave back to Truth her tortured shape.</member>
                       <member>Annulled were the tables of the law of Pain,</member>
                       <member>And in their place grew luminous characters.</member>
                       <member>The skilful Penman's unseen finger wrote</member>
                       <member>His swift intuitive calligraphy;</member>
                       <member>Earth's forms were made his divine documents,</member>
                       <member>The wisdom embodied mind could not reveal,</member>
                       <member>Inconscience chased from the world's voiceless breast;</member>
                       <member>Transfigured were the fixed schemes of reasoning Thought.</member>
                       <member>Arousing consciousness in things inert,</member>
                       <member>He imposed upon dark atom and dumb mass</member>
                       <member>The diamond script of the Imperishable,</member>
                       <member>Inscribed on the dim heart of fallen things</member>
                       <member>A paean-song of the free Infinite</member>
                       <member>And the Name, foundation of eternity,</member>
                       <member>And traced on the awake exultant cells</member>
                       <member>In the ideographs of the Ineffable</member>
                       <member>The lyric of the love that waits through Time</member>

                       <member>And the message of the superconscient Fire.</member>
                       <member>Then life beat pure in the corporeal frame;</member>
                       <member>The infernal Gleam died and could slay no more.</member>
                       <member>Hell split across its huge abrupt façade</member>

                       <member>To meet him crowded plains of brilliant calm,</member>
                       <member>Mountains and violet valleys of the Blest,</member>

                       <member>And woods of quivering purple solitude;</member>
                       <member>Below him lay like gleaming jewelled thoughts</member>
                       <member>Rapt dreaming cities of Gandharva kings.</member>
                       <member>Across the vibrant secrecies of Space</member>
                       <member>A dim and happy music sweetly stole,</member>
                       <member>Smitten by unseen hands he heard heart-close</member>
                       <member>The harps' cry of the heavenly minstrels pass,</member>
                       <member>And voices of unearthly melody</member>
                       <member>Chanted the glory of eternal love</member>
                       <member>In the white-blue-moonbeam air of Paradise.</member>
                       <member>A summit and core of all that marvellous world,</member>

                       <member>Burning like sunsets in a trance of eve.</member>
                       <member>As if to some new unsearched profundity,</member>
                       <member>Into a joyful stillness plunged their base;</member>

                       <member>Crossed by a throng of singing rivulets,</member>
                       <member>Adoring blue heaven with their happy hymn,</member>
                       <member>Down into woods of shadowy secrecy:</member>

                       <member>Their peaks climbed towards a greatness beyond life.</member>

                       <member>Desire climbed up, a swift omnipotent flame,</member>

                       <member>In the encircling arms of Energies</member>

                       <member>In scenes forbidden to our pallid sense</member>

                       <member>Recast his being's aura in joy-glow,</member>
                       <member>His body glimmered like a skiey shell;</member>
                       <member>His gates to the world were swept with seas of light.</member>
                       <member>His earth, dowered with celestial competence,</member>
                       <member>Harboured a power that needed now no more</member>
                       <member>To cross the closed customs-line of mind and flesh</member>
                       <member>And smuggle godhead into humanity.</member>
                       <member>It shrank no more from the supreme demand</member>
                       <member>Of an untired capacity for bliss,</member>

                       <member>He mixed in the radiant pastimes of the Unborn,</member>
                       <member>Heard whispers of the Player never seen</member>
                       <member>And listened to his voice that steals the heart</member>

                       <member>She only saw a thin atomic Vast,</member>
                       <member>The rare-point sparse substratum universe</member>
                       <member>On which floats a solid world's phenomenal face.</member>
                       <member>Alone a process of events was there</member>
                       <member>And Nature's plastic and protean change</member>
                       <member>And, strong by death to slay or to create,</member>
                       <member>The riven invisible atom's omnipotent force.</member>
                       <member>One chance remained that here might be a power</member>
                       <member>To liberate man from the old inadequate means</member>
                       <member>And leave him sovereign of the earthly scene.</member>
                       <member>For Reason then might grasp the original Force</member>
                       <member>To drive her car upon the roads of Time.</member>
                       <member>All then might serve the need of the thinking race,</member>

                       <member>Then science and reason careless of the soul</member>

                       <member>The sunlit sweetness of her secrecies.</member>
                       <member>Incarnating her beauty in his clasp</member>
                       <member>She gave for a brief kiss her immortal lips</member>
                       <member>And drew to her bosom one glorified mortal head:</member>
                       <member>She made earth her home, for whom heaven was too small.</member>
                       <member>In a human breast her occult presence lived;</member>
                       <member>He carved from his own self his figure of her:</member>
                       <member>She shaped her body to a mind's embrace.</member>
                       <member>Into thought's narrow limits she has come;</member>
                       <member>Her greatness she has suffered to be pressed</member>
                       <member>Into the little cabin of the Idea,</member>
                       <member>The closed room of a lonely thinker's grasp:</member>
                       <member>She has lowered her heights to the stature of our souls</member>
                       <member>And dazzled our lids with her celestial gaze.</member>
                       <member>Thus each is satisfied with his high gain</member>
                       <member>And thinks himself beyond mortality blest,</member>
                       <member>A king of truth upon his separate throne.</member>
                       <member>To her possessor in the field of Time</member>
                       <member>A single splendour caught from her glory seems</member>
                       <member>The one true light, her beauty's glowing whole.</member>
                       <member>But thought nor word can seize eternal Truth:</member>

                       <member>But only we play with our own brilliant bonds;</member>
                       <member>Tying her down, it is ourselves we tie.</member>
                       <member>In our hypnosis by one luminous point</member>
                       <member>We see not what small figure of her we hold;</member>

                       <member>We share not her immortal liberty.</member>
                       <member>Thus is it even with the seer and sage;</member>
                       <member>For still the human limits the divine:</member>
                       <member>Out of our thoughts we must leap up to sight,</member>
                       <member>Breathe her divine illimitable air,</member>
                       <member>Her simple vast supremacy confess,</member>
                       <member>Dare to surrender to her absolute.</member>
                       <member>Then the Unmanifest reflects his form</member>
                       <member>In the still mind as in a living glass;</member>
                       <member>The timeless Ray descends into our hearts</member>
                       <member>And we are rapt into eternity.</member>
                       <member>For Truth is wider, greater than her forms.</member>
                       <member>A thousand icons they have made of her</member>
                       <member>And find her in the idols they adore;</member>

                       <member>Insignia of their victory and their faith,</member>
                       <member>They offered to the Traveller at their gates</member>
                       <member>A quenchless flame or an unfading flower,</member>
                       <member>Emblem of a high kingdom's privilege.</member>
                       <member>A glorious shining Angel of the Way</member>

                       <member>Perfection's key, passport to Paradise.</member>
                       <member>Yet were there regions where these absolutes met</member>

                       <member>Light stood embraced by light, fire wedded fire,</member>
                       <member>But none in the other would his body lose</member>

                       <member>A multiplied rapture of infinity.</member>
                       <member>Onward he passed to a diviner sphere:</member>

                      <member>At last there came a bare indifferent sky</member>
                       <member>Where Silence listened to the cosmic Voice,</member>
                       <member>But answered nothing to a million calls;</member>
                       <member>The soul's endless question met with no response.</member>
                       <member>An abrupt conclusion ended eager hopes,</member>
                       <member>A deep cessation in a mighty calm,</member>
                       <member>A finis-line on the last page of thought</member>
                       <member>And a margin and a blank of wordless peace.</member>
                       <member>There paused the climbing hierarchy of worlds.</member>
                       <member>He stood on a wide arc of summit Space</member>
                       <member>Alone with an enormous Self of Mind</member>
                       <member>Which held all life in a corner of its vasts.</member>
                       <member>Omnipotent, immobile and aloof,</member>
                       <member>In the world which sprang from it, it took no part:</member>
                       <member>It gave no heed to the paeans of victory,</member>
                       <member>It was indifferent to its own defeats,</member>
                       <member>It heard the cry of grief and made no sign;</member>
                       <member>Impartial fell its gaze on evil and good,</member>
                       <member>It saw destruction come and did not move.</member>
                       <member>An equal Cause of things, a lonely Seer</member>
                       <member>And Master of its multitude of forms,</member>
                       <member>It acted not but bore all thoughts and deeds,</member>
                       <member>The witness Lord of Nature's myriad acts</member>
                       <member>Consenting to the movements of her Force.</member>
                       <member>His mind reflected this vast quietism.</member>
                       <member>This witness hush is the Thinker's secret base:</member>
                       <member>Hidden in silent depths the word is formed,</member>
                       <member>From hidden silences the act is born</member>
                       <member>Into the voiceful mind, the labouring world;</member>
                       <member>In secrecy wraps the seed the Eternal sows</member>
                       <member>Silence, the mystic birthplace of the soul.</member>
                       <member>In God's supreme withdrawn and timeless hush</member>
                       <member>A seeing Self and potent Energy met;</member>
                       <member>The Silence knew itself and thought took form:</member>
                       <member>Self-made from the dual power creation rose.</member>
                       <member>In the still self he lived and it in him;</member>
                       <member>Its mute immemorable listening depths,</member>
                       <member>Its vastness and its stillness were his own;</member>
                       <member>One being with it he grew wide, powerful, free.</member>
                       <member>Apart, unbound, he looked on all things done.</member>
                       <member>As one who builds his own imagined scenes</member>
                       <member>And loses not himself in what he sees,</member>
                       <member>Spectator of a drama self-conceived,</member>
                       <member>He looked on the world and watched its motive thoughts</member>
                       <member>With the burden of luminous prophecy in their eyes,</member>
                       <member>Its forces with their feet of wind and fire</member>
                       <member>Arisen from the dumbness in his soul.</member>
                       <member>All now he seemed to understand and know;</member>
                       <member>Desire came not nor any gust of will,</member>
                       <member>The great perturbed inquirer lost his task;</member>
                       <member>Nothing was asked nor wanted any more.</member>
                       <member>There he could stay, the Self, the Silence won:</member>
                       <member>His soul had peace, it knew the cosmic Whole.</member>
                       <member>Then suddenly a luminous finger fell</member>
                       <member>On all things seen or touched or heard or felt</member>
                       <member>And showed his mind that nothing could be known;</member>
                       <member>That must be reached from which all knowledge comes.</member>
                       <member>The sceptic Ray disrupted all that seems</member>
                       <member>And smote at the very roots of thought and sense.</member>
                       <member>In a universe of Nescience they have grown,</member>
                       <member>Aspiring towards a superconscient Sun,</member>
                       <member>Playing in shine and rain from heavenlier skies</member>
                       <member>They never can win however high their reach</member>
                       <member>Or overpass however keen their probe.</member>
                       <member>A doubt corroded even the means to think,</member>
                       <member>Distrust was thrown upon Mind's instruments;</member>
                       <member>All that it takes for reality's shining coin,</member>
                       <member>Proved fact, fixed inference, deduction clear,</member>
                       <member>Firm theory, assured significance,</member>
                       <member>Appeared as frauds upon Time's credit bank</member>
                       <member>Or assets valueless in Truth's treasury.</member>
                       <member>An Ignorance on an uneasy throne</member>
                       <member>Travestied with a fortuitous sovereignty</member>
                       <member>A figure of knowledge garbed in dubious words</member>
                       <member>And tinsel thought-forms brightly inadequate.</member>
                       <member>A labourer in the dark dazzled by half-light,</member>
                       <member>What it knew was an image in a broken glass,</member>
                       <member>What it saw was real but its sight untrue.</member>
                       <member>All the ideas in its vast repertory</member>
                       <member>Were like the mutterings of a transient cloud</member>
                       <member>That spent itself in sound and left no trace.</member>
                       <member>A frail house hanging in uncertain air,</member>
                       <member>The thin ingenious web round which it moves,</member>
                       <member>Put out awhile on the tree of the universe,</member>
                       <member>And gathered up into itself again,</member>
                       <member>Was only a trap to catch life's insect food,</member>
                       <member>Winged thoughts that flutter fragile in brief light</member>
                       <member>But dead, once captured in fixed forms of mind,</member>
                       <member>Aims puny but looming large in man's small scale,</member>
                       <member>Flickers of imagination's brilliant gauze</member>
                       <member>And cobweb-wrapped beliefs alive no more.</member>
                       <member>The magic hut of built-up certitudes</member>
                       <member>Made out of glittering dust and bright moonshine</member>
                       <member>In which it shrines its image of the Real,</member>
                       <member>Collapsed into the Nescience whence it rose.</member>
                       <member>Only a gleam was there of symbol facts</member>
                       <member>That shroud the mystery lurking in their glow,</member>
                       <member>And falsehoods based on hidden realities</member>
                       <member>By which they live until they fall from Time.</member>
                       <member>Our mind is a house haunted by the slain past,</member>
                       <member>Ideas soon mummified, ghosts of old truths,</member>
                       <member>God's spontaneities tied with formal strings</member>
                       <member>And packed into drawers of reason's trim bureau,</member>
                       <member>A grave of great lost opportunities,</member>
                       <member>Or an office for misuse of soul and life</member>
                       <member>And all the waste man makes of heaven's gifts</member>
                       <member>And all his squanderings of Nature's store,</member>
                       <member>A stage for the comedy of Ignorance.</member>
                       <member>The world seemed a long aeonic failure's scene:</member>
                       <member>All sterile grew, no base was left secure.</member>
                       <member>Assailed by the edge of the convicting beam</member>
                       <member>The builder Reason lost her confidence</member>
                       <member>In the successful sleight and turn of thought</member>
                       <member>That makes the soul the prisoner of a phrase.</member>
                       <member>Its highest wisdom was a brilliant guess,</member>
                       <member>Its mighty structured science of the worlds</member>
                       <member>A passing light on being's surfaces.</member>
                       <member>There was nothing there but a schema drawn by sense,</member>
                       <member>A substitute for eternal mysteries,</member>
                       <member>A scrawl figure of reality, a plan</member>
                       <member>And elevation by the architect Word</member>
                       <member>Imposed upon the semblances of Time.</member>
                       <member>Existence' self was shadowed by a doubt;</member>
                       <member>Almost it seemed a lotus-leaf afloat</member>
                       <member>On a nude pool of cosmic Nothingness.</member>
                       <member>This great spectator and creator Mind</member>
                       <member>Was only some half-seeing's delegate,</member>
                       <member>A veil that hung between the soul and Light,</member>
                       <member>An idol, not the living body of God.</member>
                       <member>Even the still spirit that looks upon its works</member>
                       <member>Was some pale front of the Unknowable;</member>
                       <member>A shadow seemed the wide and witness Self,</member>
                       <member>Its liberation and immobile calm</member>
                       <member>A void recoil of being from Time-made things,</member>
                       <member>Not the self-vision of Eternity.</member>
                       <member>Deep peace was there, but not the nameless Force:</member>
                       <member>Our sweet and mighty Mother was not there</member>
                       <member>Who gathers to her bosom her children's lives,</member>
                       <member>Her clasp that takes the world into her arms</member>
                       <member>In the fathomless rapture of the Infinite,</member>
                       <member>The Bliss that is creation's splendid grain</member>
                       <member>Or the white passion of God-ecstasy</member>
                       <member>That laughs in the blaze of the boundless heart of Love.</member>
                       <member>A greater Spirit than the Self of Mind</member>
                       <member>Must answer to the questioning of his soul.</member>
                       <member>For here was no firm clue and no sure road;</member>
                       <member>High-climbing pathways ceased in the unknown;</member>
                       <member>An artist Sight constructed the Beyond</member>
                       <member>In contrary patterns and conflicting hues;</member>
                       <member>A part-experience fragmented the Whole.</member>
                       <member>He looked above, but all was blank and still:</member>
                       <member>A sapphire firmament of abstract Thought</member>
                       <member>Escaped into a formless Vacancy.</member>
                       <member>He looked below, but all was dark and mute.</member>
                       <member>A noise was heard, between, of thought and prayer,</member>
                       <member>A strife, a labour without end or pause;</member>
                       <member>A vain and ignorant seeking raised its voice.</member>
                       <member>A rumour and a movement and a call,</member>
                       <member>A foaming mass, a cry innumerable</member>
                       <member>Rolled ever upon the ocean surge of Life</member>
                       <member>Along the coasts of mortal Ignorance.</member>
                       <member>On its unstable and enormous breast</member>
                       <member>Beings and forces, forms, ideas like waves</member>
                       <member>Jostled for figure and supremacy,</member>
                       <member>And rose and sank and rose again in Time;</member>
                       <member>And at the bottom of the sleepless stir,</member>
                       <member>A Nothingness parent of the struggling worlds,</member>
                       <member>A huge creator Death, a mystic Void,</member>
                       <member>For ever sustaining the irrational cry,</member>
                       <member>For ever excluding the supernal Word,</member>

                      <member>A covert answer to his seeking came.</member>
                       <member>In a far shimmering background of Mind-Space</member>
                       <member>A glowing mouth was seen, a luminous shaft;</member>
                       <member>A recluse gate it seemed, musing on joy,</member>
                       <member>A veiled retreat and escape to mystery.</member>
                       <member>Away from the unsatisfied surface world</member>
                       <member>It fled into the bosom of the unknown,</member>
                       <member>A well, a tunnel of the depths of God.</member>
                       <member>It plunged as if a mystic groove of hope</member>
                       <member>Through many layers of formless voiceless self</member>
                       <member>To reach the last profound of the world's heart,</member>
                       <member>And from that heart there surged a wordless call</member>
                       <member>Pleading with some still impenetrable Mind,</member>
                       <member>Voicing some passionate unseen desire.</member>
                       <member>As if a beckoning finger of secrecy</member>
                       <member>Outstretched into a crystal mood of air,</member>
                       <member>Pointing at him from some near hidden depth,</member>
                       <member>As if a message from the world's deep soul,</member>
                       <member>An intimation of a lurking joy</member>
                       <member>That flowed out from a cup of brooding bliss,</member>
                       <member>There shimmered stealing out into the Mind</member>
                       <member>A mute and quivering ecstasy of light,</member>
                       <member>A passion and delicacy of roseate fire.</member>
                       <member>As one drawn to his lost spiritual home</member>
                       <member>Feels now the closeness of a waiting love,</member>
                       <member>Into a passage dim and tremulous</member>
                       <member>That clasped him in from day and night's pursuit,</member>
                       <member>He travelled led by a mysterious sound.</member>
                       <member>A murmur multitudinous and lone,</member>
                       <member>All sounds it was in turn, yet still the same.</member>
                       <member>A hidden call to unforeseen delight</member>
                       <member>In the summoning voice of one long-known, well-loved,</member>
                       <member>But nameless to the unremembering mind,</member>
                       <member>It led to rapture back the truant heart.</member>
                       <member>The immortal cry ravished the captive ear.</member>
                       <member>Then, lowering its imperious mystery,</member>
                       <member>It sank to a whisper circling round the soul.</member>
                       <member>It seemed the yearning of a lonely flute</member>
                       <member>That roamed along the shores of memory</member>
                       <member>And filled the eyes with tears of longing joy.</member>
                       <member>A cricket's rash and fiery single note,</member>
                       <member>It marked with shrill melody night's moonless hush</member>
                       <member>And beat upon a nerve of mystic sleep</member>
                       <member>Its high insistent magical reveille.</member>
                       <member>A jingling silver laugh of anklet bells</member>
                       <member>Travelled the roads of a solitary heart;</member>
                       <member>Its dance solaced an eternal loneliness:</member>
                       <member>An old forgotten sweetness sobbing came.</member>
                       <member>Or from a far harmonious distance heard</member>
                       <member>The tinkling pace of a long caravan</member>
                       <member>It seemed at times, or a vast forest's hymn,</member>
                       <member>The solemn reminder of a temple gong,</member>
                       <member>A bee-croon honey-drunk in summer isles</member>
                       <member>Ardent with ecstasy in a slumbrous noon,</member>
                       <member>Or the far anthem of a pilgrim sea.</member>
                       <member>An incense floated in the quivering air,</member>
                       <member>A mystic happiness trembled in the breast</member>
                       <member>As if the invisible Beloved had come</member>
                       <member>Assuming the sudden loveliness of a face</member>
                       <member>And close glad hands could seize his fugitive feet</member>
                       <member>And the world change with the beauty of a smile.</member>
                       <member>Into a wonderful bodiless realm he came,</member>
                       <member>The home of a passion without name or voice,</member>
                       <member>A depth he felt answering to every height,</member>
                       <member>A nook was found that could embrace all worlds,</member>
                       <member>A point that was the conscious knot of Space,</member>
                       <member>An hour eternal in the heart of Time.</member>
                       <member>The silent Soul of all the world was there:</member>
                       <member>A Being lived, a Presence and a Power,</member>
                       <member>A single Person who was himself and all</member>
                       <member>And cherished Nature's sweet and dangerous throbs</member>
                       <member>Transfigured into beats divine and pure.</member>
                       <member>One who could love without return for love,</member>
                       <member>Meeting and turning to the best the worst,</member>
                       <member>It healed the bitter cruelties of earth,</member>
                       <member>Transforming all experience to delight;</member>
                       <member>Intervening in the sorrowful paths of birth</member>
                       <member>It rocked the cradle of the cosmic Child</member>
                       <member>And stilled all weeping with its hand of joy;</member>
                       <member>It led things evil towards their secret good,</member>
                       <member>It turned racked falsehood into happy truth;</member>
                       <member>Its power was to reveal divinity.</member>
                       <member>Infinite, coeval with the mind of God,</member>
                       <member>It bore within itself a seed, a flame,</member>
                       <member>A seed from which the Eternal is new-born,</member>
                       <member>A flame that cancels death in mortal things.</member>
                       <member>All grew to all kindred and self and near;</member>
                       <member>The intimacy of God was everywhere,</member>
                       <member>No veil was felt, no brute barrier inert,</member>

                       <member>A fire of passion burned in spirit-depths,</member>
                       <member>A constant touch of sweetness linked all hearts,</member>
                       <member>The throb of one adoration's single bliss</member>
                       <member>In a rapt ether of undying love.</member>
                       <member>An inner happiness abode in all,</member>

                       <member>Existence lost its aim in the Inane.</member>
                       <member>The order of the immemorial planes,</member>

                       <member>Or was a subtle kernel in the soul:</member>
                       <member>A distant greatness left it huge and dim,</member>
                       <member>A mystic closeness shut it sweetly in:</member>
                       <member>It seemed sometimes a figment or a robe</member>
                       <member>And seemed sometimes his own colossal shade.</member>
                       <member>A giant doubt overshadowed his advance.</member>
                       <member>Across a neutral all-supporting Void</member>
                       <member>Whose blankness nursed his lone immortal spirit,</member>
                       <member>Allured towards some recondite Supreme,</member>
                       <member>Aided, coerced by enigmatic Powers,</member>
                       <member>Aspiring and half-sinking and upborne,</member>
                       <member>Invincibly he ascended without pause.</member>
                       <member>Always a signless vague Immensity</member>
                       <member>Brooded, without approach, beyond response,</member>
                       <member>Condemning finite things to nothingness,</member>

                       <member>A height was reached where nothing made could live,</member>
                       <member>A line where every hope and search must cease</member>
                       <member>Neared some intolerant bare Reality,</member>
                       <member>A zero formed pregnant with boundless change.</member>
                       <member>On a dizzy verge where all disguises fail</member>
                       <member>And human mind must abdicate in Light</member>
                       <member>Or die like a moth in the naked blaze of Truth,</member>
                       <member>He stood compelled to a tremendous choice.</member>

                       <member>Must now be left behind or else transform</member>

                       <member>Alone and fronting an intangible Force</member>
                       <member>Which offered nothing to the grasp of Thought,</member>
                       <member>His spirit faced the adventure of the Inane.</member>
                       <member>Abandoned by the worlds of Form he strove.</member>
                       <member>A fruitful world-wide Ignorance foundered here;</member>

                       <member>And ineffective paused the actor Will.</member>

                       <member>Fainted in luminous insufficiency.</member>
                       <member>In an abysmal lapse of all things built</member>
                       <member>Transcending every perishable support</member>
                       <member>And joining at last its mighty origin,</member>
                       <member>The separate self must melt or be reborn</member>
                       <member>Into a Truth beyond the mind's appeal.</member>
                       <member>All glory of outline, sweetness of harmony,</member>

                       <member>A hue and imposition on the Void,</member>
                       <member>Space was the fluttering of a dream that sank</member>

                       <member>The spirit that dies not and the Godhead's self</member>

                       <member>A stark companionless Reality</member>
                       <member>Answered at last to his soul's passionate search:</member>

                      <member>A stillness absolute, incommunicable,</member>
                       <member>Meets the sheer self-discovery of the soul;</member>
                       <member>A wall of stillness shuts it from the world,</member>
                       <member>A gulf of stillness swallows up the sense</member>
                       <member>And makes unreal all that mind has known,</member>

                       <member>Self's vast spiritual silence occupies Space;</member>
                       <member>Only the Inconceivable is left,</member>
                       <member>Only the Nameless without space and time:</member>
                       <member>Abolished is the burdening need of life:</member>
                       <member>Thought falls from us, we cease from joy and grief;</member>
                       <member>The ego is dead; we are freed from being and care,</member>
                       <member>We have done with birth and death and work and fate.</member>
                       <member>O soul, it is too early to rejoice!</member>
                       <member>Thou hast reached the boundless silence of the Self,</member>
                       <member>Thou hast leaped into a glad divine abyss;</member>
                       <member>But where hast thou thrown Self's mission and Self's power?</member>
                       <member>On what dead bank on the Eternal's road?</member>
                       <member>One was within thee who was self and world,</member>

                       <member>Only the everlasting No has neared</member>
                       <member>And stared into thy eyes and killed thy heart:</member>

                       <member>And immortality in the secret heart,</member>
                       <member>The voice that chants to the creator Fire,</member>

                       <member>The bridge between the rapture and the calm,</member>

                       <member>This too is Truth at the mystic fount of Life.</member>
                       <member>A black veil has been lifted; we have seen</member>
                       <member>The mighty shadow of the omniscient Lord;</member>

                       <member>Behind the human glory of a Form,</member>
                       <member>Behind the gold eidolon of a Name.</member>

                       <member>A last bare step into eternity.</member>
                       <member>An eye has opened upon timelessness,</member>
                       <member>Infinity takes back the forms it gave,</member>

                       <member>His million rays return into the Sun.</member>

                       <member>But in her grandiose nothingness all is there:</member>
                       <member>When her strong garbs are torn away from us,</member>
                       <member>The soul's ignorance is slain but not the soul:</member>

                       <member>Life's ultimate sense, the close of being's course,</member>
                       <member>The meaning of this great mysterious world.</member>
                       <member>In absolute silence sleeps an absolute Power.</member>
                       <member>Awaking, it can wake the trance-bound soul</member>
                       <member>And in the ray reveal the parent sun:</member>
                       <member>It can make the world a vessel of Spirit's force,</member>

                       <member>All he had done was to prepare a field;</member>
                       <member>His small beginnings asked for a mighty end:</member>
                       <member>For all that he had been must now new-shape</member>
                       <member>In him her joy to embody, to enshrine</member>
                       <member>Her beauty and greatness in his house of life.</member>
                       <member>But now his being was too wide for self;</member>
                       <member>His heart's demand had grown immeasurable:</member>
                       <member>His single freedom could not satisfy,</member>
                       <member>Her light, her bliss he asked for earth and men.</member>
                       <member>But vain are human power and human love</member>
                       <member>To break earth's seal of ignorance and death;</member>
                       <member>His nature's might seemed now an infant's grasp;</member>
                       <member>Heaven is too high for outstretched hands to seize.</member>
                       <member>This Light comes not by struggle or by thought;</member>
                       <member>In the mind's silence the Transcendent acts</member>
                       <member>And the hushed heart hears the unuttered Word.</member>
                       <member>A vast surrender was his only strength.</member>
                       <member>A Power that lives upon the heights must act,</member>
                       <member>Bring into life's closed room the Immortal's air</member>
                       <member>And fill the finite with the Infinite.</member>
                       <member>All that denies must be torn out and slain</member>

                       <member>We lose the One for whom our lives were made.</member>
                       <member>Now other claims had hushed in him their cry:</member>
                       <member>Only he longed to draw her presence and power</member>
                       <member>Into his heart and mind and breathing frame;</member>
                       <member>Only he yearned to call for ever down</member>

                       <member>Into the darkness of the suffering world.</member>
                       <member>His soul was freed and given to her alone.</member>

                       <member>The stubborn mute rejection in life's depths,</member>

                       <member>A shadowy unity with a vanished past</member>
                       <member>Treasured in an old-world frame was lurking there,</member>

                       <member>And in subconscious whispers and in dream</member>

                       <member>Its treacherous elements spread like slippery grains</member>
                       <member>Hoping the incoming Truth might stumble and fall,</member>
                       <member>And old ideal voices wandering moaned</member>

                       <member>All Nature's recondite spaces were stripped bare,</member>
                       <member>All her dim crypts and corners searched with fire</member>
                       <member>Where refugee instincts and unshaped revolts</member>
                       <member>Could shelter find in darkness' sanctuary</member>
                       <member>Against the white purity of heaven's cleansing flame.</member>
                       <member>All seemed to have perished that was undivine:</member>
                       <member>Yet some minutest dissident might escape</member>

                       <member>And offered to the gods the vacant place.</member>
                       <member>Thus could he bear the touch immaculate.</member>
                       <member>A last and mightiest transformation came.</member>

                       <member>There was no more division's endless scroll;</member>
                       <member>One grew the Spirit's secret unity,</member>
                       <member>All Nature felt again the single bliss.</member>

                       <member>The covering mind was seized and torn apart;</member>
                       <member>It was dissolved and now no more could be,</member>
                       <member>The one Consciousness that made the world was seen;</member>
                       <member>All now was luminosity and force.</member>
                       <member>Abolished in its last thin fainting trace</member>
                       <member>The circle of the little self was gone;</member>
                       <member>The separate being could no more be felt;</member>

                       <member>Lost in the spirit's wide identity.</member>
                       <member>His nature grew a movement of the All,</member>
                       <member>Exploring itself to find that all was He,</member>
                       <member>His soul was a delegation of the All</member>
                       <member>That turned from itself to join the one Supreme.</member>
                       <member>Transcended was the human formula;</member>

                       <member>An Influence had approached the mortal range,</member>
                       <member>A boundless Heart was near his longing heart,</member>
                       <member>A mystic Form enveloped his earthly shape.</member>
                       <member>All at her contact broke from silence' seal;</member>
                       <member>Spirit and body thrilled identified,</member>
                       <member>Linked in the grasp of an unspoken joy;</member>
                       <member>Mind, members, life were merged in ecstasy.</member>
                       <member>Intoxicated as with nectarous rain</member>

                       <member>His body's cells awoke to spirit sense,</member>
                       <member>Each nerve became a burning thread of joy:</member>
                       <member>Tissue and flesh partook beatitude.</member>
                       <member>Alight, the dun unplumbed subconscient caves</member>
                       <member>Thrilled with the prescience of her longed-for tread</member>
                       <member>And filled with flickering crests and praying tongues.</member>
                       <member>Even lost in slumber, mute, inanimate</member>
                       <member>His very body answered to her power.</member>
                       <member>The One he worshipped was within him now:</member>
                       <member>Flame-pure, ethereal-tressed, a mighty Face</member>
                       <member>Appeared and lips moved by immortal words;</member>
                       <member>Lids, Wisdom's leaves, drooped over rapture's orbs.</member>
                       <member>A marble monument of ponderings, shone</member>
                       <member>A forehead, sight's crypt, and large like ocean's gaze</member>
                       <member>Towards Heaven, two tranquil eyes of boundless thought</member>
                       <member>Looked into man's and saw the god to come.</member>
                       <member>A Shape was seen on threshold Mind, a Voice</member>

                       <member>"O Son of Strength who climbst creation's peaks,</member>
                       <member>No soul is thy companion in the light;</member>
                       <member>Alone thou standest at the eternal doors.</member>
                       <member>What thou hast won is thine, but ask no more.</member>
                       <member>O Spirit aspiring in an ignorant frame,</member>
                       <member>O Voice arisen from the Inconscient's world,</member>
                       <member>How shalt thou speak for men whose hearts are dumb,</member>
                       <member>Make purblind earth the soul's seer-vision's home</member>
                       <member>Or lighten the burden of the senseless globe?</member>
                       <member>I am the Mystery beyond reach of mind,</member>
                       <member>I am the goal of the travail of the suns;</member>
                       <member>My fire and sweetness are the cause of life.</member>
                       <member>But too immense my danger and my joy.</member>
                       <member>Awake not the immeasurable descent,</member>
                       <member>Speak not my secret name to hostile Time;</member>
                       <member>Man is too weak to bear the Infinite's weight.</member>
                       <member>Truth born too soon might break the imperfect earth.</member>

                       <member>The Enigma's knot is tied in humankind.</member>
                       <member>A lightning from the heights that think and plan,</member>

                       <member>Man, sole awake in an unconscious world,</member>

                       <member>Arrived from some half-luminous Beyond</member>

                       <member>A traveller in his oft-shifting home</member>
                       <member>Amid the tread of many infinities,</member>
                       <member>He has pitched a tent of life in desert Space.</member>

                       <member>In the house of Nature a perturbing guest,</member>
                       <member>A voyager twixt Thought's inconstant shores,</member>
                       <member>A hunter of unknown and beautiful Powers,</member>
                       <member>A nomad of the far mysterious Light,</member>
                       <member>In the wide ways a little spark of God.</member>
                       <member>Against his spirit all is in dire league,</member>
                       <member>A Titan influence stops his Godward gaze.</member>
                       <member>Around him hungers the unpitying Void,</member>

                       <member>Inscrutable Energies drive him and deceive,</member>
                       <member>Immense implacable deities oppose.</member>
                       <member>An inert Soul and a somnambulist Force</member>
                       <member>Have made a world estranged from life and thought;</member>
                       <member>The Dragon of the dark foundations keeps</member>

                       <member>On his long way through Time and Circumstance</member>
                       <member>The grey-hued riddling nether shadow-Sphinx,</member>
                       <member>Her dreadful paws upon the swallowing sands,</member>
                       <member>Awaits him armed with the soul-slaying word:</member>
                       <member>Across his path sits the dim camp of Night.</member>
                       <member>His day is a moment in perpetual Time;</member>
                       <member>He is the prey of the minutes and the hours.</member>
                       <member>Assailed on earth and unassured of heaven,</member>
                       <member>Descended here unhappy and sublime,</member>
                       <member>A link between the demigod and the beast,</member>
                       <member>He knows not his own greatness nor his aim;</member>
                       <member>He has forgotten why he has come and whence.</member>
                       <member>His spirit and his members are at war;</member>
                       <member>His heights break off too low to reach the skies,</member>
                       <member>His mass is buried in the animal mire.</member>
                       <member>A strange antinomy is his nature's rule.</member>
                       <member>A riddle of opposites is made his field:</member>
                       <member>Freedom he asks but needs to live in bonds,</member>
                       <member>He has need of darkness to perceive some light</member>
                       <member>And need of grief to feel a little bliss;</member>
                       <member>He has need of death to find a greater life.</member>
                       <member>All sides he sees and turns to every call;</member>
                       <member>He has no certain light by which to walk;</member>
                       <member>His life is a blind-man's-buff, a hide-and-seek;</member>
                       <member>He seeks himself and from himself he runs;</member>
                       <member>Meeting himself, he thinks it other than he.</member>
                       <member>Always he builds, but finds no constant ground,</member>
                       <member>Always he journeys, but nowhere arrives;</member>
                       <member>He would guide the world, himself he cannot guide;</member>
                       <member>He would save his soul, his life he cannot save.</member>
                       <member>The light his soul had brought his mind has lost;</member>
                       <member>All he has learned is soon again in doubt;</member>
                       <member>A sun to him seems the shadow of his thoughts,</member>
                       <member>Then all is shadow again and nothing true:</member>
                       <member>Unknowing what he does or whither he tends</member>
                       <member>He fabricates signs of the Real in Ignorance.</member>
                       <member>He has hitched his mortal error to Truth's star.</member>
                       <member>Wisdom attracts him with her luminous masks,</member>
                       <member>But never has he seen the face behind:</member>
                       <member>A giant Ignorance surrounds his lore.</member>
                       <member>Assigned to meet the cosmic mystery</member>
                       <member>In the dumb figure of a material world,</member>
                       <member>His passport of entry false and his personage,</member>
                       <member>He is compelled to be what he is not;</member>
                       <member>He obeys the Inconscience he had come to rule</member>
                       <member>And sinks in Matter to fulfil his soul.</member>
                       <member>Awakened from her lower driven forms</member>
                       <member>The Earth-Mother gave her forces to his hands</member>
                       <member>And painfully he guards the heavy trust;</member>
                       <member>His mind is a lost torch-bearer on her roads.</member>
                       <member>Illumining breath to think and plasm to feel,</member>
                       <member>He labours with his slow and sceptic brain</member>
                       <member>Helped by the reason's vacillating fires,</member>
                       <member>To make his thought and will a magic door</member>
                       <member>For knowledge to enter the darkness of the world</member>
                       <member>And love to rule a realm of strife and hate.</member>
                       <member>A mind impotent to reconcile heaven and earth</member>
                       <member>And tied to Matter with a thousand bonds,</member>
                       <member>He lifts himself to be a conscious god.</member>
                       <member>Even when a glory of wisdom crowns his brow,</member>
                       <member>When mind and spirit shed a grandiose ray</member>
                       <member>To exalt this product of the sperm and gene,</member>
                       <member>This alchemist's miracle from plasm and gas,</member>
                       <member>And he who shared the animal's run and crawl</member>
                       <member>Lifts his thought-stature to the Immortal's heights,</member>
                       <member>His life still keeps the human middle way;</member>
                       <member>His body he resigns to death and pain,</member>
                       <member>Abandoning Matter, his too heavy charge.</member>
                       <member>A thaumaturge sceptic of miracles,</member>
                       <member>A spirit left sterile of its occult power</member>
                       <member>By an unbelieving brain and credulous heart,</member>
                       <member>He leaves the world to end where it began:</member>
                       <member>His work unfinished he claims a heavenly prize.</member>
                       <member>Thus has he missed creation's absolute.</member>
                       <member>Half-way he stops his star of destiny:</member>
                       <member>A vast and vain long-tried experiment,</member>
                       <member>An ill-served high conception doubtfully done,</member>
                       <member>The world's life falters on not seeing its goal,—</member>
                       <member>A zigzag towards unknown dangerous ground</member>
                       <member>Ever repeating its habitual walk,</member>
                       <member>Ever retreating after marches long</member>
                       <member>And hardiest victories without sure result,</member>
                       <member>Drawn endlessly an inconclusive game.</member>
                       <member>In an ill-fitting and voluminous robe</member>
                       <member>A radiant purpose still conceals its face,</member>
                       <member>A mighty blindness stumbles hoping on,</member>
                       <member>Feeding its strength on gifts of luminous Chance.</member>
                       <member>Because the human instrument has failed,</member>
                       <member>The Godhead frustrate sleeps within its seed,</member>
                       <member>A spirit entangled in the forms it made.</member>

                       <member>Through all the slow mysterious march goes on:</member>
                       <member>An immutable Power has made this mutable world;</member>
                       <member>A self-fulfilling transcendence treads man's road;</member>
                       <member>The driver of the soul upon its path,</member>
                       <member>It knows its steps, its way is inevitable,</member>
                       <member>And how shall the end be vain when God is guide?</member>
                       <member>However man's mind may tire or fail his flesh,</member>
                       <member>A will prevails cancelling his conscious choice:</member>

                       <member>Retreating into an immense Unknown;</member>
                       <member>There is no end to the world's stupendous march,</member>
                       <member>There is no rest for the embodied soul.</member>
                       <member>It must live on, describe all Time's huge curve.</member>
                       <member>An Influx presses from the closed Beyond</member>
                       <member>Forbidding to him rest and earthly ease,</member>
                       <member>Till he has found himself he cannot pause.</member>
                       <member>A Light there is that leads, a Power that aids;</member>
                       <member>Unmarked, unfelt it sees in him and acts:</member>

                       <member>A borrower of Supernature's gold,</member>
                       <member>He paves his road to Immortality.</member>
                       <member>The high gods look on man and watch and choose</member>
                       <member>Today's impossibles for the future's base.</member>
                       <member>His transience trembles with the Eternal's touch,</member>

                       <member>And the inner sight adored an unseen sun.</member>
                       <member>Three thoughtful seasons passed with shining tread</member>

                       <member>Autumn led in the glory of her moons</member>
                       <member>And dreamed in the splendour of her lotus pools</member>

                       <member>The tranquil beauty of the waning year.</member>

                       <member>To her they seemed the great and early steps</member>
                       <member>Hazardous of a young discovering spirit</member>

                       <member>The close outlying portions of her being</member>

                       <member>Overcoming invisible hedge and masked defence</member>
                       <member>And the loneliness that separates soul from soul,</member>
                       <member>She wished to make all one immense embrace</member>

                       <member>Raised into a splendid point of seeing light</member>

                       <member>Only a few responded to her call:</member>

                       <member>Approaching with some kinship to her heights.</member>
                       <member>Uplifted towards luminous secrecies</member>
                       <member>Or conscious of some splendour hidden above</member>
                       <member>They leaped to find her in a moment's flash,</member>
                       <member>Glimpsing a light in a celestial vast,</member>
                       <member>But could not keep the vision and the power</member>
                       <member>And fell back to life's dull ordinary tone.</member>
                       <member>A mind daring heavenly experiment,</member>
                       <member>Growing towards some largeness they felt near,</member>
                       <member>Testing the unknown's bound with eager touch</member>
                       <member>They still were prisoned by their human grain:</member>
                       <member>They could not keep up with her tireless step;</member>
                       <member>Too small and eager for her large-paced will,</member>
                       <member>Too narrow to look with the unborn Infinite's gaze</member>
                       <member>Their nature weary grew of things too great.</member>
                       <member>For even the close partners of her thoughts</member>
                       <member>Who could have walked the nearest to her ray,</member>

                       <member>She walked in their front towards a greater light,</member>
                       <member>Their leader and queen over their hearts and souls,</member>
                       <member>One close to their bosoms, yet divine and far.</member>
                       <member>Admiring and amazed they saw her stride</member>
                       <member>Attempting with a godlike rush and leap</member>
                       <member>Heights for their human stature too remote</member>
                       <member>Or with a slow great many-sided toil</member>
                       <member>Pushing towards aims they hardly could conceive;</member>
                       <member>Yet forced to be the satellites of her sun</member>
                       <member>They moved unable to forego her light,</member>
                       <member>Desiring they clutched at her with outstretched hands</member>
                       <member>Or followed stumbling in the paths she made.</member>
                       <member>Or longing with their self of life and flesh</member>
                       <member>They clung to her for heart's nourishment and support:</member>
                       <member>The rest they could not see in visible light;</member>
                       <member>Vaguely they bore her inner mightiness.</member>
                       <member>Or bound by the senses and the longing heart,</member>
                       <member>Adoring with a turbid human love,</member>
                       <member>They could not grasp the mighty spirit she was</member>
                       <member>Or change by closeness to be even as she.</member>
                       <member>Some felt her with their souls and thrilled with her,</member>
                       <member>A greatness felt near yet beyond mind's grasp;</member>
                       <member>To see her was a summons to adore,</member>

                       <member>Night lit the watch-fires of eternity.</member>

                       <member>At first a strangeness of new brilliant scenes</member>
                       <member>Peopled her mind and kept her body's gaze.</member>
                       <member>But as she moved across the changing earth</member>
                       <member>A deeper consciousness welled up in her:</member>
                       <member>A citizen of many scenes and climes,</member>
                       <member>Each soil and country it had made its home;</member>
                       <member>It took all clans and peoples for her own,</member>
                       <member>Till the whole destiny of mankind was hers.</member>
                       <member>These unfamiliar spaces on her way</member>
                       <member>Were known and neighbours to a sense within,</member>
                       <member>Landscapes recurred like lost forgotten fields,</member>
                       <member>Cities and rivers and plains her vision claimed</member>
                       <member>Like slow-recurring memories in front,</member>
                       <member>The stars at night were her past's brilliant friends,</member>
                       <member>The winds murmured to her of ancient things</member>
                       <member>And she met nameless comrades loved by her once.</member>
                       <member>All was a part of old forgotten selves:</member>
                       <member>Vaguely or with a flash of sudden hints</member>
                       <member>Her acts recalled a line of bygone power,</member>
                       <member>Even her motion's purpose was not new:</member>
                       <member>Traveller to a prefigured high event,</member>
                       <member>She seemed to her remembering witness soul</member>
                       <member>To trace again a journey often made.</member>
                       <member>A guidance turned the dumb revolving wheels</member>
                       <member>And in the eager body of their speed</member>

                       <member>Receivers of the inner and outer law,</member>
                       <member>At once the agents of his spirit's will</member>
                       <member>And witnesses and executors of his fate.</member>
                       <member>Inexorably faithful to their task,</member>

                       <member>Each is an energy loosed and holds its course.</member>
                       <member>The shadowy keepers of our deathless past</member>
                       <member>Have made our fate the child of our own acts,</member>
                       <member>And from the furrows laboured by our will</member>
                       <member>We reap the fruit of our forgotten deeds.</member>

                       <member>And we live in a present born from an unknown past,</member>
                       <member>They seem but parts of a mechanic Force</member>
                       <member>To a mechanic mind tied by earth's laws;</member>
                       <member>Yet are they instruments of a Will supreme,</member>
                       <member>Watched by a still all-seeing Eye above.</member>
                       <member>A prescient architect of Fate and Chance</member>

                       <member>And watches the inferior stumbling powers.</member>
                       <member>Upon her silent heights she was aware</member>
                       <member>Of a calm Presence throned above her brows</member>
                       <member>Who saw the goal and chose each fateful curve;</member>
                       <member>It used the body for its pedestal;</member>
                       <member>The eyes that wandered were its searchlight fires,</member>
                       <member>The hands that held the reins its living tools;</member>
                       <member>All was the working of an ancient plan,</member>
                       <member>A way proposed by an unerring Guide.</member>
                       <member>Across wide noons and glowing afternoons,</member>
                       <member>She met with Nature and with human forms</member>
                       <member>And listened to the voices of the world;</member>
                       <member>Driven from within she followed her long road,</member>
                       <member>Mute in the luminous cavern of her heart,</member>
                       <member>Like a bright cloud through the resplendent day.</member>
                       <member>At first her path ran far through peopled tracts:</member>
                       <member>Admitted to the lion eye of States</member>
                       <member>And theatres of the loud act of man,</member>
                       <member>Her carven chariot with its fretted wheels</member>
                       <member>Threaded through clamorous marts and sentinel towers</member>
                       <member>Past figured gates and high dream-sculptured fronts</member>
                       <member>And gardens hung in the sapphire of the skies,</member>
                       <member>Pillared assembly halls with armoured guards,</member>
                       <member>Small fanes where one calm Image watched man's life</member>
                       <member>And temples hewn as if by exiled gods</member>
                       <member>To imitate their lost eternity.</member>
                       <member>Often from gilded dusk to argent dawn,</member>
                       <member>Where jewel-lamps flickered on frescoed walls</member>
                       <member>And the stone lattice stared at moonlit boughs,</member>
                       <member>Half-conscious of the tardy listening night</member>
                       <member>Dimly she glided between banks of sleep</member>
                       <member>At rest in the slumbering palaces of kings.</member>
                       <member>Hamlet and village saw the fate-wain pass,</member>
                       <member>Homes of a life bent to the soil it ploughs</member>
                       <member>For sustenance of its short and passing days</member>
                       <member>That, transient, keep their old repeated course,</member>
                       <member>Unchanging in the circle of a sky</member>
                       <member>Which alters not above our mortal toil.</member>
                       <member>Away from this thinking creature's burdened hours</member>
                       <member>To free and griefless spaces now she turned</member>
                       <member>Not yet perturbed by human joys and fears.</member>
                       <member>Here was the childhood of primaeval earth,</member>
                       <member>Here timeless musings large and glad and still,</member>
                       <member>Men had forborne as yet to fill with cares,</member>
                       <member>Imperial acres of the eternal sower</member>
                       <member>And wind-stirred grass-lands winking in the sun:</member>
                       <member>Or mid green musing of woods and rough-browed hills,</member>
                       <member>In the grove's murmurous bee-air humming wild</member>
                       <member>Or past the long lapsing voice of silver floods</member>
                       <member>Like a swift hope journeying among its dreams</member>
                       <member>Hastened the chariot of the golden bride.</member>
                       <member>Out of the world's immense unhuman past</member>
                       <member>Tract-memories and ageless remnants came,</member>
                       <member>Domains of light enfeoffed to antique calm</member>
                       <member>Listened to the unaccustomed sound of hooves</member>
                       <member>And large immune entangled silences</member>
                       <member>Absorbed her into emerald secrecy</member>
                       <member>And slow hushed wizard nets of fiery bloom</member>
                       <member>Environed with their coloured snare her wheels.</member>
                       <member>The strong importunate feet of Time fell soft</member>
                       <member>Along these lonely ways, his titan pace</member>
                       <member>Forgotten and his stark and ruinous rounds.</member>
                       <member>The inner ear that listens to solitude,</member>
                       <member>Leaning self-rapt unboundedly could hear</member>
                       <member>The rhythm of the intenser wordless Thought</member>
                       <member>That gathers in the silence behind life,</member>
                       <member>And the low sweet inarticulate voice of earth</member>
                       <member>In the great passion of her sun-kissed trance</member>
                       <member>Ascended with its yearning undertone.</member>
                       <member>Afar from the brute noise of clamorous needs</member>
                       <member>The quieted all-seeking mind could feel,</member>
                       <member>At rest from its blind outwardness of will,</member>
                       <member>The unwearied clasp of her mute patient love</member>
                       <member>And know for a soul the mother of our forms.</member>
                       <member>This spirit stumbling in the fields of sense,</member>
                       <member>This creature bruised in the mortar of the days</member>
                       <member>Could find in her broad spaces of release.</member>
                       <member>Not yet was a world all occupied by care.</member>
                       <member>The bosom of our mother kept for us still</member>

                       <member>Her impersonal reaches lonely and inspired</member>
                       <member>And the mightinesses of her rapture haunts.</member>
                       <member>Muse-lipped she nursed her symbol mysteries</member>
                       <member>And guarded for her pure-eyed sacraments</member>
                       <member>The valley clefts between her breasts of joy,</member>
                       <member>Her mountain altars for the fires of dawn</member>
                       <member>And nuptial beaches where the ocean couched</member>
                       <member>And the huge chanting of her prophet woods.</member>
                       <member>Fields had she of her solitary mirth,</member>
                       <member>Plains hushed and happy in the embrace of light,</member>
                       <member>Alone with the cry of birds and hue of flowers,</member>
                       <member>And wildernesses of wonder lit by her moons</member>
                       <member>And grey seer-evenings kindling with the stars</member>
                       <member>And dim movement in the night's infinitude.</member>
                       <member>August, exulting in her Maker's eye,</member>
                       <member>She felt her nearness to him in earth's breast,</member>
                       <member>Conversed still with a Light behind the veil,</member>
                       <member>Still communed with Eternity beyond.</member>
                       <member>A few and fit inhabitants she called</member>
                       <member>To share the glad communion of her peace;</member>
                       <member>The breadth, the summit were their natural home.</member>
                       <member>The strong king-sages from their labour done,</member>

                       <member>Came to her serene sessions in these wilds;</member>
                       <member>The strife was over, the respite lay in front.</member>
                       <member>Happy they lived with birds and beasts and flowers</member>
                       <member>And sunlight and the rustle of the leaves,</member>
                       <member>And heard the wild winds wandering in the night,</member>
                       <member>Mused with the stars in their mute constant ranks,</member>
                       <member>And lodged in the mornings as in azure tents,</member>
                       <member>And with the glory of the noons were one.</member>
                       <member>Some deeper plunged; from life's external clasp</member>
                       <member>Beckoned into a fiery privacy</member>
                       <member>In the soul's unprofaned star-white recess</member>
                       <member>They sojourned with an everliving Bliss;</member>
                       <member>A Voice profound in the ecstasy and the hush</member>
                       <member>They heard, beheld an all-revealing Light.</member>
                       <member>All time-made difference they overcame;</member>
                       <member>The world was fibred with their own heart-strings;</member>
                       <member>Close drawn to the heart that beats in every breast,</member>
                       <member>They reached the one self in all through boundless love.</member>
                       <member>Attuned to Silence and to the world-rhyme,</member>
                       <member>They loosened the knot of the imprisoning mind;</member>
                       <member>Achieved was the wide untroubled witness gaze,</member>
                       <member>Unsealed was Nature's great spiritual eye;</member>
                       <member>To the height of heights rose now their daily climb:</member>

                       <member>Above them blazed eternity's mystic suns.</member>
                       <member>Nameless the austere ascetics without home</member>
                       <member>Abandoning speech and motion and desire</member>
                       <member>Aloof from creatures sat absorbed, alone,</member>
                       <member>Immaculate in tranquil heights of self</member>

                       <member>Pierced its enormous dream of solitude.</member>

                       <member>A brother of the sunshine and the sky,</member>
                       <member>A wanderer communing with depth and marge.</member>

                       <member>Taught by sublimities of stream and wood</member>
                       <member>And voices of the sun and star and flame</member>
                       <member>And chant of the magic singers on the boughs</member>
                       <member>And the dumb teaching of four-footed things.</member>
                       <member>Helping with confident steps her slow great hands</member>

                       <member>Widened with the touches of her shaping hours.</member>
                       <member>The mastery free natures have was his</member>

                       <member>One with the single Spirit inhabiting all,</member>

                       <member>His mind was open to her infinite mind,</member>
                       <member>His acts were rhythmic with her primal force;</member>
                       <member>He had subdued his mortal thought to hers.</member>
                       <member>That day he had turned from his accustomed paths;</member>
                       <member>For One who, knowing every moment's load,</member>

                       <member>Had laid the spell of destiny on his feet</member>
                       <member>And drawn him to the forest's flowering verge.</member>

                       <member>Marvelling he came across the golden sward:</member>
                       <member>Gaze met close gaze and clung in sight's embrace.</member>
                       <member>A visage was there, noble and great and calm,</member>
                       <member>As if encircled by a halo of thought,</member>
                       <member>A span, an arch of meditating light,</member>
                       <member>As though some secret nimbus half was seen;</member>
                       <member>Her inner vision still remembering knew</member>

                       <member>Two eyes her constant and eternal stars,</member>
                       <member>Comrade and sovereign eyes that claimed her soul,</member>
                       <member>Lids known through many lives, large frames of love.</member>
                       <member>He met in her regard his future's gaze,</member>

                       <member>Made in material shape his very own.</member>
                       <member>This golden figure given to his grasp</member>
                       <member>Hid in its breast the key of all his aims,</member>
                       <member>A spell to bring the Immortal's bliss on earth,</member>
                       <member>To mate with heaven's truth our mortal thought,</member>
                       <member>To lift earth-hearts nearer the Eternal's sun.</member>
                       <member>In these great spirits now incarnate here</member>
                       <member>Love brought down power out of eternity</member>
                       <member>To make of life his new undying base.</member>
                       <member>His passion surged a wave from fathomless deeps;</member>
                       <member>It leaped to earth from far forgotten heights,</member>
                       <member>But kept its nature of infinity.</member>
                       <member>On the dumb bosom of this oblivious globe</member>
                       <member>Although as unknown beings we seem to meet,</member>
                       <member>Our lives are not aliens nor as strangers join,</member>
                       <member>Moved to each other by a causeless force.</member>
                       <member>The soul can recognise its answering soul</member>
                       <member>Across dividing Time and, on life's roads</member>
                       <member>Absorbed wrapped traveller, turning it recovers</member>
                       <member>Familiar splendours in an unknown face</member>
                       <member>And touched by the warning finger of swift love</member>
                       <member>It thrills again to an immortal joy</member>
                       <member>Wearing a mortal body for delight.</member>
                       <member>There is a Power within that knows beyond</member>
                       <member>Our knowings; we are greater than our thoughts,</member>
                       <member>And sometimes earth unveils that vision here.</member>
                       <member>To live, to love are signs of infinite things,</member>
                       <member>Love is a glory from eternity's spheres.</member>
                       <member>Abased, disfigured, mocked by baser mights</member>
                       <member>That steal his name and shape and ecstasy,</member>
                       <member>He is still the godhead by which all can change.</member>
                       <member>A mystery wakes in our inconscient stuff,</member>
                       <member>A bliss is born that can remake our life.</member>
                       <member>Love dwells in us like an unopened flower</member>
                       <member>Awaiting a rapid moment of the soul,</member>
                       <member>Or he roams in his charmed sleep mid thoughts and things;</member>
                       <member>The child-god is at play, he seeks himself</member>
                       <member>In many hearts and minds and living forms:</member>
                       <member>He lingers for a sign that he can know</member>
                       <member>And, when it comes, wakes blindly to a voice,</member>
                       <member>A look, a touch, the meaning of a face.</member>
                       <member>His instrument the dim corporeal mind,</member>
                       <member>Of celestial insight now forgetful grown,</member>
                       <member>He seizes on some sign of outward charm</member>
                       <member>To guide him mid the throng of Nature's hints,</member>
                       <member>Reads heavenly truths into earth's semblances,</member>
                       <member>Desires the image for the godhead's sake,</member>
                       <member>Divines the immortalities of form</member>
                       <member>And takes the body for the sculptured soul.</member>
                       <member>Love's adoration like a mystic seer</member>
                       <member>Through vision looks at the invisible,</member>
                       <member>In earth's alphabet finds a godlike sense;</member>
                       <member>But the mind only thinks, "Behold the one</member>
                       <member>For whom my life has waited long unfilled,</member>
                       <member>Behold the sudden sovereign of my days."</member>
                       <member>Heart feels for heart, limb cries for answering limb;</member>
                       <member>All strives to enforce the unity all is.</member>
                       <member>Too far from the Divine, Love seeks his truth</member>
                       <member>And Life is blind and the instruments deceive</member>
                       <member>And Powers are there that labour to debase.</member>
                       <member>Still can the vision come, the joy arrive.</member>
                       <member>Rare is the cup fit for love's nectar wine,</member>
                       <member>As rare the vessel that can hold God's birth;</member>
                       <member>A soul made ready through a thousand years</member>
                       <member>Is the living mould of a supreme Descent.</member>
                       <member>These knew each other though in forms thus strange.</member>
                       <member>Although to sight unknown, though life and mind</member>
                       <member>Had altered to hold a new significance,</member>
                       <member>These bodies summed the drift of numberless births,</member>
                       <member>And the spirit to the spirit was the same.</member>
                       <member>Amazed by a joy for which they had waited long,</member>
                       <member>The lovers met upon their different paths,</member>
                       <member>Travellers across the limitless plains of Time</member>
                       <member>Together drawn from fate-led journeyings</member>
                       <member>In the self-closed solitude of their human past,</member>
                       <member>To a swift rapturous dream of future joy</member>
                       <member>And the unexpected present of these eyes.</member>
                       <member>By the revealing greatness of a look,</member>
                       <member>Form-smitten the spirit's memory woke in sense.</member>
                       <member>The mist was torn that lay between two lives;</member>
                       <member>Her heart unveiled and his to find her turned;</member>
                       <member>Attracted as in heaven star by star,</member>
                       <member>They wondered at each other and rejoiced</member>
                       <member>And wove affinity in a silent gaze.</member>
                       <member>A moment passed that was eternity's ray,</member>
                       <member>An hour began, the matrix of new Time.</member>

                       <member>At once aware grew of each other warned</member>
                       <member>By the first call of a delightful voice</member>
                       <member>And a first vision of the destined face.</member>
                       <member>As when being cries to being from its depths</member>
                       <member>Behind the screen of the external sense</member>
                       <member>And strives to find the heart-disclosing word,</member>
                       <member>The passionate speech revealing the soul's need,</member>
                       <member>But the mind's ignorance veils the inner sight,</member>
                       <member>Only a little breaks through our earth-made bounds,</member>
                       <member>So now they met in that momentous hour,</member>
                       <member>So utter the recognition in the deeps,</member>
                       <member>The remembrance lost, the oneness felt and missed.</member>
                       <member>Thus Satyavan spoke first to Savitri:</member>
                       <member>"O thou who com'st to me out of Time's silences,</member>
                       <member>Yet thy voice has wakened my heart to an unknown bliss,</member>
                       <member>Immortal or mortal only in thy frame,</member>
                       <member>For more than earth speaks to me from thy soul</member>
                       <member>And more than earth surrounds me in thy gaze,</member>
                       <member>How art thou named among the sons of men?</member>
                       <member>Whence hast thou dawned filling my spirit's days,</member>
                       <member>Brighter than summer, brighter than my flowers,</member>
                       <member>Into the lonely borders of my life,</member>
                       <member>O sunlight moulded like a golden maid?</member>
                       <member>I know that mighty gods are friends of earth.</member>
                       <member>Amid the pageantries of day and dusk,</member>
                       <member>Long have I travelled with my pilgrim soul</member>
                       <member>Moved by the marvel of familiar things.</member>
                       <member>Earth could not hide from me the powers she veils:</member>
                       <member>Even though moving mid an earthly scene</member>
                       <member>And the common surfaces of terrestrial things,</member>
                       <member>My vision saw unblinded by her forms;</member>
                       <member>The Godhead looked at me from familiar scenes.</member>
                       <member>I witnessed the virgin bridals of the dawn</member>
                       <member>Behind the glowing curtains of the sky</member>
                       <member>Or vying in joy with the bright morning's steps</member>
                       <member>I paced along the slumbrous coasts of noon,</member>
                       <member>Or the gold desert of the sunlight crossed</member>
                       <member>Traversing great wastes of splendour and of fire,</member>
                       <member>Or met the moon gliding amazed through heaven</member>
                       <member>In the uncertain wideness of the night,</member>
                       <member>Or the stars marched on their long sentinel routes</member>
                       <member>Pointing their spears through the infinitudes:</member>
                       <member>The day and dusk revealed to me hidden shapes;</member>
                       <member>Figures have come to me from secret shores</member>
                       <member>And happy faces looked from ray and flame.</member>
                       <member>I have heard strange voices cross the ether's waves,</member>
                       <member>The Centaur's wizard song has thrilled my ear;</member>
                       <member>I have glimpsed the Apsaras bathing in the pools,</member>
                       <member>I have seen the wood-nymphs peering through the leaves;</member>
                       <member>The winds have shown to me their trampling lords,</member>
                       <member>I have beheld the princes of the Sun</member>
                       <member>Burning in thousand-pillared homes of light.</member>
                       <member>So now my mind could dream and my heart fear</member>
                       <member>That from some wonder-couch beyond our air</member>
                       <member>Risen in a wide morning of the gods</member>
                       <member>Thou drov'st thy horses from the Thunderer's worlds.</member>
                       <member>Although to heaven thy beauty seems allied,</member>
                       <member>Much rather would my thoughts rejoice to know</member>
                       <member>That mortal sweetness smiles between thy lids</member>
                       <member>And thy heart can beat beneath a human gaze</member>
                       <member>And thy aureate bosom quiver with a look</member>
                       <member>And its tumult answer to an earth-born voice.</member>
                       <member>If our time-vexed affections thou canst feel,</member>
                       <member>Earth's ease of simple things can satisfy,</member>
                       <member>If thy glance can dwell content on earthly soil,</member>
                       <member>And this celestial summary of delight,</member>
                       <member>Thy golden body, dally with fatigue</member>
                       <member>Oppressing with its grace our terrain, while</member>
                       <member>The frail sweet passing taste of earthly food</member>
                       <member>Delays thee and the torrent's leaping wine,</member>
                       <member>Descend. Let thy journey cease, come down to us.</member>
                       <member>Close is my father's creepered hermitage</member>
                       <member>Screened by the tall ranks of these silent kings,</member>
                       <member>Sung to by voices of the hue-robed choirs</member>
                       <member>Whose chants repeat transcribed in music's notes</member>
                       <member>The passionate coloured lettering of the boughs</member>
                       <member>And fill the hours with their melodious cry.</member>
                       <member>Amid the welcome-hum of many bees</member>
                       <member>Invade our honied kingdom of the woods;</member>
                       <member>There let me lead thee into an opulent life.</member>
                       <member>Bare, simple is the sylvan hermit-life;</member>
                       <member>Yet is it clad with the jewelry of earth.</member>
                       <member>Wild winds run—visitors midst the swaying tops,</member>
                       <member>Through the calm days heaven's sentinels of peace</member>
                       <member>Couched on a purple robe of sky above</member>
                       <member>Look down on a rich secrecy and hush</member>
                       <member>And the chambered nuptial waters chant within.</member>
                       <member>Enormous, whispering, many-formed around</member>
                       <member>High forest gods have taken in their arms</member>
                       <member>The human hour, a guest of their centuried pomps.</member>
                       <member>Apparelled are the morns in gold and green,</member>
                       <member>Sunlight and shadow tapestry the walls</member>
                       <member>To make a resting chamber fit for thee."</member>
                       <member>Awhile she paused as if hearing still his voice,</member>
                       <member>Unwilling to break the charm, then slowly spoke.</member>
                       <member>Musing she answered, "I am Savitri,</member>
                       <member>Princess of Madra. Who art thou? What name</member>
                       <member>Musical on earth expresses thee to men?</member>
                       <member>What trunk of kings watered by fortunate streams</member>
                       <member>Has flowered at last upon one happy branch?</member>
                       <member>Why is thy dwelling in the pathless wood</member>
                       <member>Far from the deeds thy glorious youth demands,</member>
                       <member>Haunt of the anchorites and earth's wilder broods,</member>
                       <member>Where only with thy witness self thou roamst</member>
                       <member>In Nature's green unhuman loneliness</member>
                       <member>Surrounded by enormous silences</member>
                       <member>And the blind murmur of primaeval calms?"</member>
                       <member>And Satyavan replied to Savitri:</member>
                       <member>"In days when yet his sight looked clear on life,</member>
                       <member>King Dyumatsena once, the Shalwa, reigned</member>
                       <member>Through all the tract which from behind these tops</member>
                       <member>Passing its days of emerald delight</member>

                       <member>Turns, looking back towards the southern heavens,</member>
                       <member>And leans its flank upon the musing hills.</member>
                       <member>But equal Fate removed her covering hand.</member>
                       <member>A living night enclosed the strong man's paths,</member>
                       <member>Heaven's brilliant gods recalled their careless gifts,</member>
                       <member>Took from blank eyes their glad and helping ray</member>
                       <member>And led the uncertain goddess from his side.</member>
                       <member>Outcast from empire of the outer light,</member>
                       <member>Lost to the comradeship of seeing men,</member>
                       <member>He sojourns in two solitudes, within</member>
                       <member>And in the solemn rustle of the woods.</member>
                       <member>Son of that king, I, Satyavan, have lived</member>
                       <member>Contented, for not yet of thee aware,</member>
                       <member>In my high-peopled loneliness of spirit</member>
                       <member>And this huge vital murmur kin to me,</member>
                       <member>Nursed by the vastness, pupil of solitude.</member>
                       <member>Great Nature came to her recovered child;</member>
                       <member>I reigned in a kingdom of a nobler kind</member>
                       <member>Than men can build upon dull Matter's soil;</member>
                       <member>I met the frankness of the primal earth,</member>
                       <member>I enjoyed the intimacy of infant God.</member>
                       <member>In the great tapestried chambers of her state,</member>
                       <member>Free in her boundless palace I have dwelt</member>
                       <member>Indulged by the warm mother of us all,</member>
                       <member>Reared with my natural brothers in her house.</member>
                       <member>I lay in the wide bare embrace of heaven,</member>
                       <member>The sunlight's radiant blessing clasped my brow,</member>
                       <member>The moonbeams' silver ecstasy at night</member>
                       <member>Kissed my dim lids to sleep. Earth's morns were mine;</member>
                       <member>Lured by faint murmurings with the green-robed hours</member>
                       <member>I wandered lost in woods, prone to the voice</member>
                       <member>Of winds and waters, partner of the sun's joy,</member>
                       <member>A listener to the universal speech:</member>
                       <member>My spirit satisfied within me knew</member>
                       <member>Godlike our birthright, luxuried our life</member>
                       <member>Whose close belongings are the earth and skies.</member>
                       <member>Before Fate led me into this emerald world,</member>
                       <member>Aroused by some foreshadowing touch within,</member>
                       <member>An early prescience in my mind approached</member>
                       <member>The great dumb animal consciousness of earth</member>
                       <member>Now grown so close to me who have left old pomps</member>
                       <member>To live in this grandiose murmur dim and vast.</member>
                       <member>Already I met her in my spirit's dream.</member>
                       <member>As if to a deeper country of the soul</member>
                       <member>Transposing the vivid imagery of earth,</member>
                       <member>Through an inner seeing and sense a wakening came.</member>
                       <member>A visioned spell pursued my boyhood's hours,</member>
                       <member>All things the eye had caught in coloured lines</member>
                       <member>Were seen anew through the interpreting mind</member>
                       <member>And in the shape it sought to seize the soul.</member>
                       <member>An early child-god took my hand that held,</member>
                       <member>Moved, guided by the seeking of his touch,</member>
                       <member>Bright forms and hues which fled across his sight;</member>
                       <member>Limned upon page and stone they spoke to men.</member>
                       <member>High beauty's visitants my intimates were.</member>
                       <member>The neighing pride of rapid life that roams</member>
                       <member>Wind-maned through our pastures, on my seeing mood</member>
                       <member>Cast shapes of swiftness; trooping spotted deer</member>
                       <member>Against the vesper sky became a song</member>
                       <member>Of evening to the silence of my soul.</member>
                       <member>I caught for some eternal eye the sudden</member>
                       <member>King-fisher flashing to a darkling pool;</member>
                       <member>A slow swan silvering the azure lake,</member>
                       <member>A shape of magic whiteness, sailed through dream;</member>
                       <member>Leaves trembling with the passion of the wind,</member>
                       <member>Pranked butterflies, the conscious flowers of air,</member>
                       <member>And wandering wings in blue infinity</member>
                       <member>Lived on the tablets of my inner sight;</member>
                       <member>Mountains and trees stood there like thoughts from God.</member>
                       <member>The brilliant long-bills in their vivid dress,</member>
                       <member>The peacock scattering on the breeze his moons</member>
                       <member>Painted my memory like a frescoed wall.</member>
                       <member>I carved my vision out of wood and stone;</member>
                       <member>I caught the echoes of a word supreme</member>
                       <member>And metred the rhythm-beats of infinity</member>
                       <member>And listened through music for the eternal Voice.</member>
                       <member>I felt a covert touch, I heard a call,</member>
                       <member>But could not clasp the body of my God</member>
                       <member>Or hold between my hands the World-Mother's feet.</member>
                       <member>In men I met strange portions of a Self</member>
                       <member>That sought for fragments and in fragments lived:</member>
                       <member>Each lived in himself and for himself alone</member>
                       <member>And with the rest joined only fleeting ties;</member>
                       <member>Each passioned over his surface joy and grief,</member>
                       <member>Nor saw the Eternal in his secret house.</member>
                       <member>I conversed with Nature, mused with the changeless stars,</member>
                       <member>God's watch-fires burning in the ignorant Night,</member>
                       <member>And saw upon her mighty visage fall</member>
                       <member>A ray prophetic of the Eternal's sun.</member>
                       <member>I sat with the forest sages in their trance:</member>
                       <member>There poured awakening streams of diamond light,</member>
                       <member>I glimpsed the presence of the One in all.</member>
                       <member>But still there lacked the last transcendent power</member>
                       <member>And Matter still slept empty of its Lord.</member>
                       <member>The Spirit was saved, the body lost and mute</member>
                       <member>Lived still with Death and ancient Ignorance;</member>
                       <member>The Inconscient was its base, the Void its fate.</member>
                       <member>But thou hast come and all will surely change:</member>
                       <member>I shall feel the World-Mother in thy golden limbs</member>
                       <member>And hear her wisdom in thy sacred voice.</member>
                       <member>The child of the Void shall be reborn in God,</member>
                       <member>My Matter shall evade the Inconscient's trance.</member>
                       <member>My body like my spirit shall be free.</member>
                       <member>It shall escape from Death and Ignorance."</member>
                       <member>And Savitri, musing still, replied to him:</member>
                       <member>"Speak more to me, speak more, O Satyavan,</member>
                       <member>Speak of thyself and all thou art within;</member>
                       <member>I would know thee as if we had ever lived</member>
                       <member>Together in the chamber of our souls.</member>
                       <member>Speak till a light shall come into my heart</member>
                       <member>And my moved mortal mind shall understand</member>
                       <member>What all the deathless being in me feels.</member>
                       <member>It knows that thou art he my spirit has sought</member>
                       <member>Amidst earth's thronging visages and forms</member>
                       <member>Across the golden spaces of my life."</member>
                       <member>And Satyavan like a replying harp</member>
                       <member>To the insistent calling of a flute</member>
                       <member>Answered her questioning and let stream to her</member>
                       <member>His heart in many-coloured waves of speech:</member>
                       <member>"O golden princess, perfect Savitri,</member>
                       <member>More I would tell than failing words can speak,</member>
                       <member>Of all that thou hast meant to me, unknown,</member>
                       <member>All that the lightning-flash of love reveals</member>
                       <member>In one great hour of the unveiling gods.</member>
                       <member>Even a brief nearness has reshaped my life.</member>
                       <member>For now I know that all I lived and was</member>
                       <member>Moved towards this moment of my heart's rebirth;</member>
                       <member>I look back on the meaning of myself,</member>
                       <member>A soul made ready on earth's soil for thee.</member>
                       <member>Once were my days like days of other men:</member>
                       <member>To think and act was all, to enjoy and breathe;</member>
                       <member>This was the width and height of mortal hope:</member>
                       <member>Yet there came glimpses of a deeper self</member>
                       <member>That lives behind Life and makes her act its scene.</member>
                       <member>A truth was felt that screened its shape from mind,</member>
                       <member>A Greatness working towards a hidden end,</member>
                       <member>And vaguely through the forms of earth there looked</member>
                       <member>Something that life is not and yet must be.</member>
                       <member>I groped for the Mystery with the lantern, Thought.</member>
                       <member>Its glimmerings lighted with the abstract word</member>
                       <member>A half-visible ground and travelling yard by yard</member>
                       <member>It mapped a system of the Self and God.</member>
                       <member>I could not live the truth it spoke and thought.</member>
                       <member>I turned to seize its form in visible things,</member>
                       <member>Hoping to fix its rule by mortal mind,</member>
                       <member>Imposed a narrow structure of world-law</member>
                       <member>Upon the freedom of the Infinite,</member>
                       <member>A hard firm skeleton of outward Truth,</member>
                       <member>A mental scheme of a mechanic Power.</member>
                       <member>This light showed more the darknesses unsearched;</member>
                       <member>It made the original Secrecy more occult;</member>
                       <member>It could not analyse its cosmic Veil</member>
                       <member>Or glimpse the Wonder-worker's hidden hand</member>
                       <member>And trace the pattern of his magic plans.</member>
                       <member>I plunged into an inner seeing Mind</member>
                       <member>And knew the secret laws and sorceries</member>
                       <member>That make of Matter mind's bewildered slave:</member>
                       <member>The mystery was not solved but deepened more.</member>
                       <member>I strove to find its hints through Beauty and Art,</member>
                       <member>But Form cannot unveil the indwelling Power;</member>
                       <member>Only it throws its symbols at our hearts.</member>
                       <member>It evoked a mood of self, invoked a sign</member>
                       <member>Of all the brooding glory hidden in sense:</member>
                       <member>I lived in the ray but faced not to the sun.</member>
                       <member>I looked upon the world and missed the Self,</member>
                       <member>And when I found the Self, I lost the world,</member>
                       <member>My other selves I lost and the body of God,</member>
                       <member>The link of the finite with the Infinite,</member>
                       <member>The bridge between the appearance and the Truth,</member>
                       <member>The mystic aim for which the world was made,</member>
                       <member>The human sense of Immortality.</member>
                       <member>But now the gold link comes to me with thy feet</member>
                       <member>And His gold sun has shone on me from thy face.</member>
                       <member>For now another realm draws near with thee</member>
                       <member>And now diviner voices fill my ear,</member>
                       <member>A strange new world swims to me in thy gaze</member>
                       <member>Approaching like a star from unknown heavens;</member>
                       <member>A cry of spheres comes with thee and a song</member>
                       <member>Of flaming gods. I draw a wealthier breath</member>
                       <member>And in a fierier march of moments move.</member>
                       <member>My mind transfigures to a rapturous seer.</member>
                       <member>A foam-leap travelling from the waves of bliss</member>
                       <member>Has changed my heart and changed the earth around:</member>
                       <member>All with thy coming fills. Air, soil and stream</member>
                       <member>Wear bridal raiment to be fit for thee</member>
                       <member>And sunlight grows a shadow of thy hue</member>
                       <member>Because of change within me by thy look.</member>
                       <member>Come nearer to me from thy car of light</member>
                       <member>On this green sward disdaining not our soil.</member>
                       <member>For here are secret spaces made for thee</member>
                       <member>Whose caves of emerald long to screen thy form.</member>
                       <member>Wilt thou not make this mortal bliss thy sphere?</member>
                       <member>Descend, O happiness, with thy moon-gold feet</member>
                       <member>Enrich earth's floors upon whose sleep we lie.</member>
                       <member>O my bright beauty's princess Savitri,</member>
                       <member>By my delight and thy own joy compelled</member>
                       <member>Enter my life, thy chamber and thy shrine.</member>
                       <member>In the great quietness where spirits meet,</member>
                       <member>Led by my hushed desire into my woods</member>
                       <member>Let the dim rustling arches over thee lean;</member>
                       <member>One with the breath of things eternal live,</member>
                       <member>Thy heart-beats near to mine, till there shall leap</member>
                       <member>Enchanted from the fragrance of the flowers</member>
                       <member>A moment which all murmurs shall recall</member>
                       <member>And every bird remember in its cry."</member>

                       <member>Her fathomless soul looked out at him from her eyes;</member>
                       <member>Passing her lips in liquid sounds it spoke.</member>
                       <member>This word alone she uttered and said all:</member>
                       <member>"O Satyavan, I have heard thee and I know;</member>
                       <member>I know that thou and only thou art he."</member>
                       <member>Then down she came from her high carven car</member>
                       <member>Descending with a soft and faltering haste;</member>
                       <member>Her many-hued raiment glistening in the light</member>
                       <member>Hovered a moment over the wind-stirred grass,</member>
                       <member>Mixed with a glimmer of her body's ray</member>
                       <member>Like lovely plumage of a settling bird.</member>
                       <member>Her gleaming feet upon the green-gold sward</member>
                       <member>Scattered a memory of wandering beams</member>
                       <member>And lightly pressed the unspoken desire of earth</member>
                       <member>Cherished in her too brief passing by the soil.</member>
                       <member>Then flitting like pale-brilliant moths her hands</member>
                       <member>Took from the sylvan verge's sunlit arms</member>
                       <member>A load of their jewel-faces' clustering swarms,</member>
                       <member>Companions of the spring-time and the breeze.</member>
                       <member>A candid garland set with simple forms</member>
                       <member>Her rapid fingers taught a flower song,</member>
                       <member>The stanzaed movement of a marriage hymn.</member>
                       <member>Profound in perfume and immersed in hue</member>
                       <member>They mixed their yearning's coloured signs and made</member>
                       <member>The bloom of their purity and passion one.</member>
                       <member>A sacrament of joy in treasuring palms</member>
                       <member>She brought, flower-symbol of her offered life,</member>
                       <member>Then with raised hands that trembled a little now</member>
                       <member>At the very closeness that her soul desired,</member>
                       <member>This bond of sweetness, their bright union's sign,</member>
                       <member>She laid on the bosom coveted by her love.</member>
                       <member>As if inclined before some gracious god</member>
                       <member>Who has out of his mist of greatness shone</member>
                       <member>To fill with beauty his adorer's hours,</member>
                       <member>She bowed and touched his feet with worshipping hands;</member>

                       <member>Her beating heart a remembrancer of bliss.</member>
                       <member>He bent to her and took into his own</member>
                       <member>Their married yearning joined like folded hopes;</member>
                       <member>As if a whole rich world suddenly possessed,</member>
                       <member>Wedded to all he had been, became himself,</member>
                       <member>An inexhaustible joy made his alone,</member>
                       <member>He gathered all Savitri into his clasp.</member>
                       <member>Around her his embrace became the sign</member>
                       <member>Of a locked closeness through slow intimate years,</member>
                       <member>A first sweet summary of delight to come,</member>
                       <member>One brevity intense of all long life.</member>
                       <member>In a wide moment of two souls that meet</member>
                       <member>She felt her being flow into him as in waves</member>
                       <member>A river pours into a mighty sea.</member>
                       <member>As when a soul is merging into God</member>
                       <member>To live in Him for ever and know His joy,</member>
                       <member>Her consciousness grew aware of him alone</member>
                       <member>And all her separate self was lost in his.</member>
                       <member>As a starry heaven encircles happy earth,</member>
                       <member>He shut her into himself in a circle of bliss</member>
                       <member>And shut the world into himself and her.</member>
                       <member>A boundless isolation made them one;</member>
                       <member>He was aware of her enveloping him</member>
                       <member>And let her penetrate his very soul</member>
                       <member>As is a world by the world's spirit filled,</member>

                       <member>Love's twain had joined together and grew one.</member>

                       <member>As grows the great and golden bounteous tree</member>
                       <member>Flowering by Alacananda's murmuring waves,</member>
                       <member>Where with enamoured speed the waters run</member>
                       <member>Lisping and babbling to the splendour of morn</member>
                       <member>And cling with lyric laughter round the knees</member>
                       <member>Of heaven's daughters dripping magic rain</member>
                       <member>Pearl-bright from moon-gold limbs and cloudy hair,</member>
                       <member>So are her dawns like jewelled leaves of light,</member>
                       <member>So casts she her felicity on men.</member>
                       <member>A flame of radiant happiness she was born</member>
                       <member>And surely will that flame set earth alight:</member>
                       <member>Doom surely will see her pass and say no word!</member>
                       <member>But too often here the careless Mother leaves</member>
                       <member>Her chosen in the envious hands of Fate:</member>
                       <member>The harp of God falls mute, its call to bliss</member>
                       <member>Discouraged fails mid earth's unhappy sounds;</member>
                       <member>The strings of the siren Ecstasy cry not here</member>
                       <member>Or soon are silenced in the human heart.</member>
                       <member>Of sorrow's songs we have enough: bid once</member>
                       <member>Her glad and griefless days bring heaven here.</member>
                       <member>Or must fire always test the great of soul?</member>
                       <member>Along the dreadful causeway of the Gods,</member>
                       <member>Armoured with love and faith and sacred joy,</member>
                       <member>A traveller to the Eternal's house,</member>
                       <member>Once let unwounded pass a mortal life."</member>
                       <member>But Narad answered not; silent he sat,</member>
                       <member>Knowing that words are vain and Fate is lord.</member>
                       <member>He looked into the unseen with seeing eyes,</member>
                       <member>Then, dallying with the mortal's ignorance</member>
                       <member>Like one who knows not, questioning, he cried:</member>
                       <member>"On what high mission went her hastening wheels?</member>
                       <member>Whence came she with this glory in her heart</member>
                       <member>And Paradise made visible in her eyes?</member>
                       <member>What sudden God has met, what face supreme?"</member>
                       <member>To whom the king, "The red asoca watched</member>
                       <member>Her going forth which now sees her return.</member>
                       <member>Arisen into an air of flaming dawn</member>
                       <member>Like a bright bird tired of her lonely branch,</member>
                       <member>To find her own lord, since to her on earth</member>
                       <member>He came not yet, this sweetness wandered forth</member>
                       <member>Cleaving her way with the beat of her rapid wings.</member>
                       <member>Led by a distant call her vague swift flight</member>
                       <member>Threaded the summer morns and sunlit lands.</member>
                       <member>The happy rest her burdened lashes keep</member>
                       <member>And these charmed guardian lips hold treasured still.</member>
                       <member>Virgin who comest perfected by joy,</member>
                       <member>Reveal the name thy sudden heart-beats learned.</member>
                       <member>Whom hast thou chosen, kingliest among men?"</member>
                       <member>And Savitri answered with her still calm voice</member>
                       <member>As one who speaks beneath the eyes of Fate:</member>
                       <member>"Father and king, I have carried out thy will.</member>
                       <member>One whom I sought I found in distant lands;</member>
                       <member>I have obeyed my heart, I have heard its call.</member>
                       <member>On the borders of a dreaming wilderness</member>
                       <member>Mid Shalwa's giant hills and brooding woods</member>
                       <member>In his thatched hermitage Dyumatsena dwells,</member>
                       <member>Blind, exiled, outcast, once a mighty king.</member>
                       <member>The son of Dyumatsena, Satyavan,</member>
                       <member>I have met on the wild forest's lonely verge.</member>
                       <member>My father, I have chosen. This is done."</member>
                       <member>Astonished, all sat silent for a space.</member>
                       <member>Then Aswapati looked within and saw</member>
                       <member>A heavy shadow float above the name</member>
                       <member>Chased by a sudden and stupendous light;</member>
                       <member>He looked into his daughter's eyes and spoke:</member>
                       <member>"Well hast thou done and I approve thy choice.</member>
                       <member>If this is all, then all is surely well;</member>
                       <member>If there is more, then all can still be well.</member>
                       <member>Whether it seem good or evil to men's eyes,</member>
                       <member>Only for good the secret Will can work.</member>
                       <member>Our destiny is written in double terms:</member>
                       <member>Through Nature's contraries we draw nearer God;</member>
                       <member>Out of the darkness we still grow to light.</member>
                       <member>Death is our road to immortality.</member>
                       <member>'Cry woe, cry woe,' the world's lost voices wail,</member>
                       <member>Yet conquers the eternal Good at last."</member>
                       <member>Then might the sage have spoken, but the king</member>
                       <member>In haste broke out and stayed the dangerous word:</member>
                       <member>"O singer of the ultimate ecstasy,</member>
                       <member>Lend not a dangerous vision to the blind</member>
                       <member>Because by native right thou hast seen clear.</member>
                       <member>Impose not on the mortal's tremulous breast</member>
                       <member>The dire ordeal that foreknowledge brings;</member>
                       <member>Demand not now the Godhead in our acts.</member>
                       <member>Here are not happy peaks the heaven-nymphs roam</member>
                       <member>Or Coilas or Vaicountha's starry stair:</member>
                       <member>Abrupt, jagged hills only the mighty climb</member>
                       <member>Are here where few dare even think to rise;</member>
                       <member>Far voices call down from the dizzy rocks,</member>
                       <member>Chill, slippery, precipitous are the paths.</member>
                       <member>Too hard the gods are with man's fragile race;</member>
                       <member>In their large heavens they dwell exempt from Fate</member>
                       <member>And they forget the wounded feet of man,</member>
                       <member>His limbs that faint beneath the whips of grief,</member>
                       <member>His heart that hears the tread of time and death.</member>
                       <member>The future's road is hid from mortal sight:</member>
                       <member>He moves towards a veiled and secret face.</member>
                       <member>To light one step in front is all his hope</member>
                       <member>And only for a little strength he asks</member>
                       <member>To meet the riddle of his shrouded fate.</member>
                       <member>Awaited by a vague and half-seen force,</member>
                       <member>Aware of danger to his uncertain hours</member>
                       <member>He guards his flickering yearnings from her breath;</member>
                       <member>He feels not when the dreadful fingers close</member>
                       <member>Around him with the grasp none can elude.</member>
                       <member>If thou canst loose her grip, then only speak.</member>
                       <member>Perhaps from the iron snare there is escape:</member>
                       <member>Our mind perhaps deceives us with its words</member>
                       <member>And gives the name of doom to our own choice;</member>
                       <member>Perhaps the blindness of our will is Fate."</member>
                       <member>He said and Narad answered not the king.</member>
                       <member>But now the queen alarmed lifted her voice:</member>
                       <member>"O seer, thy bright arrival has been timed</member>
                       <member>To this high moment of a happy life;</member>
                       <member>Then let the speech benign of griefless spheres</member>
                       <member>Confirm this blithe conjunction of two stars</member>
                       <member>And sanction joy with thy celestial voice.</member>
                       <member>Here drag not in the peril of our thoughts,</member>
                       <member>Let not our words create the doom they fear.</member>
                       <member>Here is no cause for dread, no chance for grief</member>
                       <member>To raise her ominous head and stare at love.</member>
                       <member>A single spirit in a multitude,</member>
                       <member>Happy is Satyavan mid earthly men</member>
                       <member>Whom Savitri has chosen for her mate,</member>
                       <member>And fortunate the forest hermitage</member>
                       <member>Where leaving her palace and riches and a throne</member>
                       <member>My Savitri will dwell and bring in heaven.</member>
                       <member>Then let thy blessing put the immortals' seal</member>
                       <member>On these bright lives' unstained felicity</member>
                       <member>Pushing the ominous Shadow from their days.</member>
                       <member>Too heavy falls a Shadow on man's heart;</member>
                       <member>It dares not be too happy upon earth.</member>
                       <member>It dreads the blow dogging too vivid joys,</member>
                       <member>A lash unseen in Fate's extended hand,</member>
                       <member>The danger lurking in fortune's proud extremes,</member>
                       <member>An irony in life's indulgent smile,</member>
                       <member>And trembles at the laughter of the gods.</member>
                       <member>Or if crouches unseen a panther doom,</member>
                       <member>If wings of Evil brood above that house,</member>
                       <member>Then also speak, that we may turn aside</member>
                       <member>And rescue our lives from hazard of wayside doom</member>
                       <member>And chance entanglement of an alien fate."</member>
                       <member>And Narad slowly answered to the queen:</member>
                       <member>"What help is in prevision to the driven?</member>
                       <member>Safe doors cry opening near, the doomed pass on.</member>
                       <member>A future knowledge is an added pain,</member>
                       <member>A torturing burden and a fruitless light</member>
                       <member>On the enormous scene that Fate has built.</member>
                       <member>The eternal poet, universal Mind,</member>
                       <member>Has paged each line of his imperial act;</member>
                       <member>Invisible the giant actors tread</member>
                       <member>And man lives like some secret player's mask.</member>
                       <member>He knows not even what his lips shall speak.</member>
                       <member>For a mysterious Power compels his steps</member>
                       <member>And life is stronger than his trembling soul.</member>
                       <member>None can refuse what the stark Force demands:</member>
                       <member>Her eyes are fixed upon her mighty aim;</member>
                       <member>No cry or prayer can turn her from her path.</member>
                       <member>She has leaped an arrow from the bow of God."</member>
                       <member>His words were theirs who live unforced to grieve</member>
                       <member>And help by calm the swaying wheels of life</member>
                       <member>And the long restlessness of transient things</member>
                       <member>And the trouble and passion of the unquiet world.</member>
                       <member>As though her own bosom were pierced the mother saw</member>
                       <member>The ancient human sentence strike her child,</member>
                       <member>Her sweetness that deserved another fate</member>
                       <member>Only a larger measure given of tears.</member>
                       <member>Aspiring to the nature of the gods,</member>
                       <member>A mind proof-armoured mailed in mighty thoughts,</member>
                       <member>A will entire couchant behind wisdom's shield,</member>
                       <member>Though to still heavens of knowledge she had risen,</member>
                       <member>Though calm and wise and Aswapati's queen,</member>
                       <member>Human was she still and opened her doors to grief;</member>
                       <member>The stony-eyed injustice she accused</member>
                       <member>Of the marble godhead of inflexible Law,</member>
                       <member>Nor sought the strength extreme adversity brings</member>
                       <member>To lives that stand erect and front the World-Power:</member>
                       <member>Her heart appealed against the impartial judge,</member>
                       <member>Taxed with perversity the impersonal One.</member>
                       <member>Her tranquil spirit she called not to her aid,</member>
                       <member>But as a common man beneath his load</member>
                       <member>Grows faint and breathes his pain in ignorant words,</member>
                       <member>So now she arraigned the world's impassive will:</member>
                       <member>"What stealthy doom has crept across her path</member>
                       <member>Emerging from the dark forest's sullen heart,</member>
                       <member>What evil thing stood smiling by the way</member>
                       <member>And wore the beauty of the Shalwa boy?</member>
                       <member>Perhaps he came an enemy from her past</member>
                       <member>Armed with a hidden force of ancient wrongs,</member>
                       <member>Himself unknowing, and seized her unknown.</member>
                       <member>Here dreadfully entangled love and hate</member>
                       <member>Meet us blind wanderers mid the perils of Time.</member>
                       <member>Our days are links of a disastrous chain,</member>
                       <member>Necessity avenges casual steps;</member>
                       <member>Old cruelties come back unrecognised,</member>
                       <member>The gods make use of our forgotten deeds.</member>
                       <member>Yet all in vain the bitter law was made.</member>
                       <member>Our own minds are the justicers of doom.</member>
                       <member>For nothing have we learned, but still repeat</member>
                       <member>Our stark misuse of self and others' souls.</member>
                       <member>There are dire alchemies of the human heart</member>
                       <member>And fallen from his ethereal element</member>
                       <member>Love darkens to the spirit of nether gods.</member>
                       <member>The dreadful angel, angry with his joys</member>
                       <member>Woundingly sweet he cannot yet forego,</member>
                       <member>Is pitiless to the soul his gaze disarmed,</member>
                       <member>He visits with his own pangs his quivering prey</member>

                       <member>As if in love with our own agony.</member>
                       <member>This is one poignant misery in the world,</member>
                       <member>And grief has other lassoes for our life.</member>
                       <member>Our sympathies become our torturers.</member>
                       <member>Strength have I my own punishment to bear,</member>
                       <member>Knowing it just, but on this earth perplexed,</member>
                       <member>Smitten in the sorrow of scourged and helpless things,</member>
                       <member>Often it faints to meet other suffering eyes.</member>
                       <member>We are not as the gods who know not grief</member>
                       <member>And look impassive on a suffering world,</member>
                       <member>Calm they gaze down on the little human scene</member>
                       <member>And the short-lived passion crossing mortal hearts.</member>
                       <member>An ancient tale of woe can move us still,</member>
                       <member>We keep the ache of breasts that breathe no more,</member>
                       <member>We are shaken by the sight of human pain,</member>
                       <member>And share the miseries that others feel.</member>
                       <member>Ours not the passionless lids that cannot age.</member>
                       <member>Too hard for us is heaven's indifference:</member>
                       <member>Our own tragedies are not enough for us,</member>
                       <member>All pathos and all sufferings we make ours;</member>
                       <member>We have sorrow for a greatness passed away</member>
                       <member>And feel the touch of tears in mortal things.</member>
                       <member>Even a stranger's anguish rends my heart,</member>
                       <member>And this, O Narad, is my well-loved child.</member>
                       <member>Hide not from us our doom, if doom is ours.</member>
                       <member>This is the worst, an unknown face of Fate,</member>
                       <member>A terror ominous, mute, felt more than seen</member>
                       <member>Behind our seat by day, our couch by night,</member>
                       <member>A Fate lurking in the shadow of our hearts,</member>
                       <member>The anguish of the unseen that waits to strike.</member>
                       <member>To know is best, however hard to bear."</member>
                       <member>Then cried the sage piercing the mother's heart,</member>
                       <member>Forcing to steel the will of Savitri,</member>
                       <member>His words set free the spring of cosmic Fate.</member>
                       <member>The great Gods use the pain of human hearts</member>
                       <member>As a sharp axe to hew their cosmic road:</member>
                       <member>They squander lavishly men's blood and tears</member>
                       <member>For a moment's purpose in their fateful work.</member>
                       <member>This cosmic Nature's balance is not ours</member>
                       <member>Nor the mystic measure of her need and use.</member>
                       <member>A single word lets loose vast agencies;</member>
                       <member>A casual act determines the world's fate.</member>
                       <member>So now he set free destiny in that hour.</member>
                       <member>"The truth thou hast claimed; I give to thee the truth.</member>
                       <member>A marvel of the meeting earth and heavens</member>
                       <member>Is he whom Savitri has chosen mid men,</member>
                       <member>His figure is the front of Nature's march,</member>
                       <member>His single being excels the works of Time.</member>
                       <member>A sapphire cutting from the sleep of heaven,</member>
                       <member>Delightful is the soul of Satyavan,</member>
                       <member>A ray out of the rapturous Infinite,</member>
                       <member>A silence waking to a hymn of joy.</member>
                       <member>A divinity and kingliness gird his brow;</member>
                       <member>His eyes keep a memory from a world of bliss.</member>
                       <member>As brilliant as a lonely moon in heaven,</member>
                       <member>Gentle like the sweet bud that spring desires,</member>
                       <member>Pure like a stream that kisses silent banks,</member>
                       <member>He takes with bright surprise spirit and sense.</member>
                       <member>A living knot of golden Paradise,</member>
                       <member>A blue Immense he leans to the longing world,</member>
                       <member>Time's joy borrowed out of eternity,</member>
                       <member>A star of splendour or a rose of bliss.</member>
                       <member>In him soul and Nature, equal Presences,</member>
                       <member>Balance and fuse in a wide harmony.</member>
                       <member>The Happy in their bright ether have not hearts</member>
                       <member>More sweet and true than this of mortal make</member>
                       <member>That takes all joy as the world's native gift</member>
                       <member>And to all gives joy as the world's natural right.</member>
                       <member>His speech carries a light of inner truth,</member>
                       <member>And a large-eyed communion with the Power</member>
                       <member>In common things has made veilless his mind,</member>
                       <member>A seer in earth-shapes of garbless deity.</member>
                       <member>A tranquil breadth of sky windless and still</member>
                       <member>Watching the world like a mind of unplumbed thought,</member>
                       <member>A silent space musing and luminous</member>
                       <member>Uncovered by the morning to delight,</member>
                       <member>A green tangle of trees upon a happy hill</member>
                       <member>Made into a murmuring nest by southern winds,</member>
                       <member>These are his images and parallels,</member>
                       <member>His kin in beauty and in depth his peers.</member>
                       <member>A will to climb lifts a delight to live,</member>
                       <member>Heaven's height companion of earth-beauty's charm,</member>
                       <member>An aspiration to the immortals' air</member>
                       <member>Lain on the lap of mortal ecstasy.</member>
                       <member>His sweetness and his joy attract all hearts</member>
                       <member>To live with his own in a glad tenancy,</member>
                       <member>His strength is like a tower built to reach heaven,</member>
                       <member>A godhead quarried from the stones of life.</member>
                       <member>O loss, if death into its elements</member>
                       <member>Of which his gracious envelope was built,</member>
                       <member>Shatter this vase before it breathes its sweets,</member>
                       <member>As if earth could not keep too long from heaven</member>
                       <member>A treasure thus unique loaned by the gods,</member>
                       <member>A being so rare, of so divine a make!</member>
                       <member>In one brief year when this bright hour flies back</member>
                       <member>And perches careless on a branch of Time,</member>
                       <member>This sovereign glory ends heaven lent to earth,</member>
                       <member>This splendour vanishes from the mortal's sky:</member>
                       <member>Heaven's greatness came, but was too great to stay.</member>
                       <member>Twelve swift-winged months are given to him and her;</member>
                       <member>This day returning Satyavan must die."</member>
                       <member>A lightning bright and nude the sentence fell.</member>
                       <member>But the queen cried: "Vain then can be heaven's grace!</member>
                       <member>Heaven mocks us with the brilliance of its gifts,</member>
                       <member>For Death is a cupbearer of the wine</member>
                       <member>Of too brief joy held up to mortal lips</member>
                       <member>For a passionate moment by the careless gods.</member>
                       <member>But I reject the grace and the mockery.</member>
                       <member>Mounting thy car go forth, O Savitri,</member>
                       <member>And travel once more through the peopled lands.</member>
                       <member>Alas, in the green gladness of the woods</member>
                       <member>Thy heart has stooped to a misleading call.</member>
                       <member>Choose once again and leave this fated head,</member>
                       <member>Death is the gardener of this wonder-tree;</member>
                       <member>Love's sweetness sleeps in his pale marble hand.</member>
                       <member>Advancing in a honeyed line but closed,</member>
                       <member>A little joy would buy too bitter an end.</member>
                       <member>Plead not thy choice, for death has made it vain.</member>
                       <member>Thy youth and radiance were not born to lie</member>
                       <member>A casket void dropped on a careless soil;</member>
                       <member>A choice less rare may call a happier fate."</member>
                       <member>But Savitri answered from her violent heart,—</member>
                       <member>Her voice was calm, her face was fixed like steel:</member>
                       <member>"Once my heart chose and chooses not again.</member>
                       <member>The word I have spoken can never be erased,</member>
                       <member>It is written in the record book of God.</member>
                       <member>The truth once uttered, from the earth's air effaced,</member>
                       <member>By mind forgotten, sounds immortally</member>
                       <member>For ever in the memory of Time.</member>
                       <member>Once the dice fall thrown by the hand of Fate</member>
                       <member>In an eternal moment of the gods.</member>
                       <member>My heart has sealed its troth to Satyavan:</member>
                       <member>Its signature adverse Fate cannot efface,</member>
                       <member>Its seal not Fate nor Death nor Time dissolve.</member>
                       <member>Those who shall part who have grown one being within?</member>
                       <member>Death's grip can break our bodies, not our souls;</member>
                       <member>If death take him, I too know how to die.</member>
                       <member>Let Fate do with me what she will or can;</member>
                       <member>I am stronger than death and greater than my fate;</member>
                       <member>My love shall outlast the world, doom falls from me</member>
                       <member>Helpless against my immortality.</member>
                       <member>Fate's law may change, but not my spirit's will."</member>
                       <member>An adamant will, she cast her speech like bronze.</member>
                       <member>But in the queen's mind listening her words</member>
                       <member>Rang like the voice of a self-chosen Doom</member>
                       <member>Denying every issue of escape.</member>
                       <member>To her own despair answer the mother made;</member>
                       <member>As one she cried who in her heavy heart</member>
                       <member>Labours amid the sobbing of her hopes</member>
                       <member>To wake a note of help from sadder strings:</member>

                       <member>And laughs and weeps mid faces new, unknown.</member>
                       <member>The body thou hast loved is cast away</member>
                       <member>Amidst the brute unchanging stuff of worlds</member>

                       <member>And love divine replace the human tie.</member>
                       <member>There is a shrouded law, an austere force:</member>

                       <member>Of work and thought and measured grave delight</member>
                       <member>As steps to climb to God's far secret heights.</member>
                       <member>Then is our life a tranquil pilgrimage,</member>

                       <member>But Savitri replied with steadfast eyes:</member>

                       <member>My strength is not the Titan's; it is God's.</member>
                       <member>I have discovered my glad reality</member>
                       <member>Beyond my body in another's being:</member>
                       <member>I have found the deep unchanging soul of love.</member>
                       <member>Then how shall I desire a lonely good,</member>
                       <member>Or slay, aspiring to white vacant peace,</member>
                       <member>The endless hope that made my soul spring forth</member>
                       <member>Out of its infinite solitude and sleep?</member>
                       <member>My spirit has glimpsed the glory for which it came,</member>

                       <member>My eternity clasped by his eternity</member>
                       <member>And, tireless of the sweet abysms of Time,</member>
                       <member>Deep possibility always to love.</member>
                       <member>This, this is first, last joy and to its throb</member>
                       <member>The riches of a thousand fortunate years</member>

                       <member>And what to me are common souls of men</member>
                       <member>Or eyes and lips that are not Satyavan's?</member>
                       <member>I have no need to draw back from his arms</member>
                       <member>And the discovered paradise of his love</member>
                       <member>And journey into a still infinity.</member>
                       <member>Only now for my soul in Satyavan</member>

                       <member>Only to live and love awhile and die.</member>
                       <member>For I know now why my spirit came on earth</member>

                       <member>Some timeless beauty and reality,</member>

                       <member>Forgotten soon or a pale memory</member>
                       <member>The fountain's plash in the white stone-bound pool,</member>
                       <member>The thoughtful noontide's brooding solemn trance,</member>
                       <member>The colonnade's dream grey in the quiet eve,</member>

                       <member>Left far behind were now the faces known,</member>

                       <member>And the close-clinging clasp of intimate hands</member>
                       <member>And adoration's light in cherished eyes</member>
                       <member>Offered to the one sovereign of their life.</member>
                       <member>Nature's primaeval loneliness was here:</member>

                       <member>The ascetic's exile in the dim-souled huge</member>
                       <member>Inhuman forest far from cheerful sound</member>
                       <member>Of man's blithe converse and his crowded days.</member>
                       <member>In a broad eve with one red eye of cloud,</member>
                       <member>Through a narrow opening, a green flowered cleft,</member>
                       <member>Out of the stare of sky and soil they came</member>
                       <member>Into a mighty home of emerald dusk.</member>
                       <member>There onward led by a faint brooding path</member>
                       <member>Which toiled through the shadow of enormous trunks</member>
                       <member>And under arches misers of sunshine,</member>
                       <member>They saw low thatched roofs of a hermitage</member>
                       <member>Huddled beneath a patch of azure hue</member>
                       <member>In a sunlit clearing that seemed the outbreak</member>
                       <member>Of a glad smile in the forest's monstrous heart,</member>
                       <member>A rude refuge of the thought and will of man</member>
                       <member>Watched by the crowding giants of the wood.</member>
                       <member>Arrived in that rough-hewn homestead they gave,</member>

                       <member>Their pride and loved one to the great blind king,</member>
                       <member>A regal pillar of fallen mightiness</member>
                       <member>And the stately care-worn woman once a queen</member>
                       <member>Who now hoped nothing for herself from life,</member>
                       <member>But all things only hoped for her one child,</member>

                       <member>And knew not of the evil drawing near.</member>
                       <member>Lingering some days upon the forest verge</member>

                       <member>From one whom we shall never see again;</member>
                       <member>Driven by the singularity of her fate,</member>

                       <member>An absolutism of sweet imperious will,</member>

                       <member>Of love while yet thou canst, to her thou lov'st.</member>
                       <member>Imprint thyself for every nerve to keep</member>
                       <member>That thrills to thee the message of my heart.</member>
                       <member>For soon we part and who shall know how long</member>
                       <member>Before the great wheel in its monstrous round</member>
                       <member>Restore us to each other and our love?"</member>
                       <member>Too well she loved to speak a fateful word</member>
                       <member>And lay her burden on his happy head;</member>
                       <member>She pressed the outsurging grief back into her breast</member>
                       <member>To dwell within silent, unhelped, alone.</member>
                       <member>But Satyavan sometimes half understood,</member>
                       <member>Or felt at least with the uncertain answer</member>
                       <member>Of our thought-blinded hearts the unuttered need,</member>
                       <member>The unplumbed abyss of her deep passionate want.</member>
                       <member>All of his speeding days that he could spare</member>
                       <member>From labour in the forest hewing wood</member>
                       <member>And hunting food in the wild sylvan glades</member>
                       <member>And service to his father's sightless life</member>
                       <member>He gave to her and helped to increase the hours</member>
                       <member>By the nearness of his presence and his clasp,</member>
                       <member>And lavish softness of heart-seeking words</member>
                       <member>And the close beating felt of heart on heart.</member>
                       <member>All was too little for her bottomless need.</member>
                       <member>If in his presence she forgot awhile,</member>
                       <member>Grief filled his absence with its aching touch;</member>
                       <member>She saw the desert of her coming days</member>
                       <member>Imaged in every solitary hour.</member>
                       <member>Although with a vain imaginary bliss</member>
                       <member>Of fiery union through death's door of escape</member>
                       <member>She dreamed of her body robed in funeral flame,</member>
                       <member>She knew she must not clutch that happiness</member>
                       <member>To die with him and follow, seizing his robe</member>
                       <member>Across our other countries, travellers glad</member>
                       <member>Into the sweet or terrible Beyond.</member>
                       <member>For those sad parents still would need her here</member>
                       <member>To help the empty remnant of their day.</member>
                       <member>Often it seemed to her the ages' pain</member>
                       <member>Had pressed their quintessence into her single woe,</member>
                       <member>Concentrating in her a tortured world.</member>
                       <member>Thus in the silent chamber of her soul</member>
                       <member>Cloistering her love to live with secret grief</member>
                       <member>She dwelt like a dumb priest with hidden gods</member>

                       <member>Lifting to them her sorrow like frankincense,</member>
                       <member>Her life the altar, herself the sacrifice.</member>
                       <member>Yet ever they grew into each other more</member>
                       <member>Until it seemed no power could rend apart,</member>
                       <member>Since even the body's walls could not divide.</member>
                       <member>For when he wandered in the forest, oft</member>
                       <member>Her conscious spirit walked with him and knew</member>
                       <member>His actions as if in herself he moved;</member>
                       <member>He, less aware, thrilled with her from afar.</member>
                       <member>Always the stature of her passion grew;</member>
                       <member>Grief, fear became the food of mighty love.</member>

                       <member>It was all her life, became her whole earth and heaven.</member>
                       <member>Although life-born, an infant of the hours,</member>
                       <member>Immortal it walked unslayable as the gods:</member>
                       <member>Her spirit stretched measureless in strength divine,</member>
                       <member>An anvil for the blows of Fate and Time:</member>
                       <member>Or tired of sorrow's passionate luxury,</member>
                       <member>Grief's self became calm, dull-eyed, resolute,</member>
                       <member>Awaiting some issue of its fiery struggle,</member>
                       <member>Some deed in which it might for ever cease,</member>

                       <member>A summons from her being's summit came,</member>

                       <member>A mighty Voice invaded mortal space.</member>

                       <member>And yet was intimate with all the world</member>

                       <member>And rigid golden statue of motionless trance,</member>
                       <member>A stone of God lit by an amethyst soul.</member>
                       <member>Around her body's stillness all grew still:</member>
                       <member>Her heart listened to its slow measured beats,</member>
                       <member>Her mind renouncing thought heard and was mute:</member>

                       <member>Tied like a sacrifice on the altar of Time,</member>

                       <member>Or struggle with mute inevitable Fate</member>
                       <member>Or hope in vain to uplift an ignorant race</member>

                       <member>He sits in peace and leaves the mortal's strength</member>
                       <member>Impotent against his calm omnipotent Law</member>
                       <member>And Inconscience and the almighty hands of Death.</member>
                       <member>What need have I, what need has Satyavan</member>
                       <member>To avoid the black-meshed net, the dismal door,</member>
                       <member>Or call a mightier Light into life's closed room,</member>
                       <member>A greater Law into man's little world?</member>
                       <member>Why should I strive with earth's unyielding laws</member>
                       <member>Or stave off death's inevitable hour?</member>
                       <member>This surely is best to pactise with my fate</member>
                       <member>And follow close behind my lover's steps</member>

                       <member>Across the tenebrous river that divides</member>
                       <member>The adjoining parishes of earth and heaven.</member>
                       <member>Then could we lie inarmed breast upon breast,</member>

                       <member>Delivering her from her unconsciousness,</member>

                       <member>And lead man to Truth's wide and golden road</member>
                       <member>That runs through finite things to eternity?</member>
                       <member>Is this then the report that I must make,</member>
                       <member>My head bowed with shame before the Eternal's seat,—</member>
                       <member>His power he kindled in thy body has failed,</member>
                       <member>His labourer returns, her task undone?"</member>
                       <member>Then Savitri's heart fell mute, it spoke no word.</member>
                       <member>But holding back her troubled rebel heart,</member>
                       <member>Abrupt, erect and strong, calm like a hill,</member>
                       <member>Surmounting the seas of mortal ignorance,</member>
                       <member>Its peak immutable above mind's air,</member>
                       <member>A Power within her answered the still Voice:</member>

                       <member>As thou myself seated for ever above,</member>
                       <member>Speak to my depths, O great and deathless Voice,</member>
                       <member>Command, for I am here to do thy will."</member>
                       <member>The Voice replied: "Remember why thou cam'st:</member>

                       <member>Cast from thee sense that veils thy spirit's sight:</member>
                       <member>In the enormous emptiness of thy mind</member>
                       <member>Thou shalt see the Eternal's body in the world,</member>

                       <member>The opponent Powers withdrew their dreadful guard;</member>
                       <member>Her being entered into the inner worlds.</member>
                       <member>In a narrow passage, the subconscient's gate,</member>
                       <member>She breathed with difficulty and pain and strove</member>
                       <member>To find the inner self concealed in sense.</member>
                       <member>Into a dense of subtle Matter packed,</member>
                       <member>A cavity filled with a blind mass of power,</member>
                       <member>An opposition of misleading gleams,</member>
                       <member>A heavy barrier of unseeing sight,</member>
                       <member>She forced her way through body to the soul.</member>
                       <member>Across a perilous border line she passed</member>
                       <member>Where Life dips into the subconscient dusk</member>
                       <member>Or struggles from Matter into chaos of mind,</member>
                       <member>Aswarm with elemental entities</member>
                       <member>And fluttering shapes of vague half-bodied thought</member>
                       <member>And crude beginnings of incontinent force.</member>
                       <member>At first a difficult narrowness was there,</member>
                       <member>A press of uncertain powers and drifting wills;</member>
                       <member>For all was there but nothing in its place.</member>
                       <member>At times an opening came, a door was forced;</member>
                       <member>She crossed through spaces of a secret self</member>
                       <member>And trod in passages of inner Time.</member>
                       <member>At last she broke into a form of things,</member>
                       <member>A start of finiteness, a world of sense:</member>
                       <member>But all was still confused, nothing self-found.</member>
                       <member>Soul was not there but only cries of life.</member>
                       <member>A thronged and clamorous air environed her.</member>
                       <member>A horde of sounds defied significance,</member>
                       <member>A dissonant clash of cries and contrary calls;</member>
                       <member>A mob of visions broke across the sight,</member>
                       <member>A jostled sequence lacking sense and suite,</member>
                       <member>Feelings pushed through a packed and burdened heart,</member>
                       <member>Each forced its separate inconsequent way</member>
                       <member>But cared for nothing but its ego's drive.</member>
                       <member>A rally without key of common will,</member>
                       <member>Thought stared at thought and pulled at the taut brain</member>
                       <member>As if to pluck the reason from its seat</member>
                       <member>And cast its corpse into life's wayside drain;</member>
                       <member>So might forgotten lie in Nature's mud</member>
                       <member>Abandoned the slain sentinel of the soul.</member>
                       <member>So could life's power shake from it mind's rule,</member>
                       <member>Nature renounce the spirit's government</member>
                       <member>And the bare elemental energies</member>
                       <member>Make of the sense a glory of boundless joy,</member>
                       <member>A splendour of ecstatic anarchy,</member>
                       <member>A revel mighty and mad of utter bliss.</member>
                       <member>This was the sense's instinct void of soul</member>
                       <member>Or when the soul sleeps hidden void of power,</member>
                       <member>But now the vital godhead wakes within</member>
                       <member>And lifts the life with the Supernal's touch.</member>
                       <member>But how shall come the glory and the flame</member>
                       <member>If mind is cast away into the abyss?</member>
                       <member>For body without mind has not the light,</member>
                       <member>The rapture of spirit sense, the joy of life;</member>
                       <member>All then becomes subconscient, tenebrous,</member>
                       <member>Inconscience puts its seal on Nature's page</member>
                       <member>Or else a mad disorder whirls the brain</member>
                       <member>Posting along a ravaged nature's roads,</member>
                       <member>A chaos of disordered impulses</member>
                       <member>In which no light can come, no joy, no peace.</member>
                       <member>This state now threatened, this she pushed from her.</member>
                       <member>As if in a long endless tossing street</member>
                       <member>One driven mid a trampling hurrying crowd</member>
                       <member>Hour after hour she trod without release</member>
                       <member>Holding by her will the senseless meute at bay;</member>
                       <member>Out of the dreadful press she dragged her will</member>
                       <member>And fixed her thought upon the saviour Name;</member>
                       <member>Then all grew still and empty; she was free.</member>
                       <member>A large deliverance came, a vast calm space.</member>
                       <member>Awhile she moved through a blank tranquillity</member>
                       <member>Of naked Light from an invisible sun,</member>
                       <member>A void that was a bodiless happiness,</member>
                       <member>A blissful vacuum of nameless peace.</member>
                       <member>But now a mightier danger's front drew near:</member>
                       <member>The press of bodily mind, the Inconscient's brood</member>
                       <member>Of aimless thought and will had fallen from her.</member>
                       <member>Approaching loomed a giant head of Life</member>
                       <member>Ungoverned by mind or soul, subconscient, vast.</member>
                       <member>It tossed all power into a single drive,</member>
                       <member>It made its power a might of dangerous seas.</member>
                       <member>Into the stillness of her silent self,</member>
                       <member>Into the whiteness of its muse of Space</member>
                       <member>A spate, a torrent of the speed of Life</member>
                       <member>Broke like a wind-lashed driven mob of waves</member>
                       <member>Racing on a pale floor of summer sand;</member>
                       <member>It drowned its banks, a mountain of climbing waves.</member>
                       <member>Enormous was its vast and passionate voice.</member>
                       <member>It cried to her listening spirit as it ran,</member>
                       <member>Demanding God's submission to chainless Force.</member>
                       <member>A deaf force calling to a status dumb,</member>
                       <member>A thousand voices in a muted Vast,</member>
                       <member>It claimed the heart's support for its clutch at joy,</member>
                       <member>For its need to act the witness Soul's consent,</member>
                       <member>For its lust of power her neutral being's seal.</member>
                       <member>Into the wideness of her watching self</member>
                       <member>It brought a grandiose gust of the Breath of Life;</member>
                       <member>Its torrent carried the world's hopes and fears,</member>
                       <member>All life's, all Nature's dissatisfied hungry cry,</member>
                       <member>And the longing all eternity cannot fill.</member>
                       <member>It called to the mountain secrecies of the soul</member>
                       <member>And the miracle of the never-dying fire,</member>
                       <member>It spoke to some first inexpressible ecstasy</member>
                       <member>Hidden in the creative beat of Life;</member>
                       <member>Out of the nether unseen deeps it tore</member>
                       <member>Its lure and magic of disordered bliss,</member>
                       <member>Into earth-light poured its maze of tangled charm</member>
                       <member>And heady draught of Nature's primitive joy</member>
                       <member>And the fire and mystery of forbidden delight</member>
                       <member>Drunk from the world-libido's bottomless well,</member>
                       <member>And the honey-sweet poison-wine of lust and death,</member>
                       <member>But dreamed a vintage of glory of life's gods,</member>
                       <member>And felt as celestial rapture's golden sting.</member>
                       <member>The cycles of the infinity of desire</member>
                       <member>And the mystique that made an unrealised world</member>
                       <member>Wider than the known and closer than the unknown</member>
                       <member>In which hunt for ever the hounds of mind and life,</member>
                       <member>Tempted a deep dissatisfied urge within</member>
                       <member>To long for the unfulfilled and ever far</member>
                       <member>And make this life upon a limiting earth</member>
                       <member>A climb towards summits vanishing in the void,</member>
                       <member>A search for the glory of the impossible.</member>
                       <member>It dreamed of that which never has been known,</member>
                       <member>It grasped at that which never has been won,</member>
                       <member>It chased into an Elysian memory</member>
                       <member>The charms that flee from the heart's soon lost delight;</member>
                       <member>It dared the force that slays, the joys that hurt,</member>
                       <member>The imaged shape of unaccomplished things</member>
                       <member>And the summons to a Circean transmuting dance</member>
                       <member>And passion's tenancy of the courts of love</member>
                       <member>And the wild Beast's ramp and romp with Beauty and Life.</member>
                       <member>It brought its cry and surge of opposite powers,</member>
                       <member>Its moments of the touch of luminous planes,</member>
                       <member>Its flame-ascensions and sky-pitched vast attempts,</member>
                       <member>Its fiery towers of dream built on the winds,</member>
                       <member>Its sinkings towards the darkness and the abyss,</member>
                       <member>Its honey of tenderness, its sharp wine of hate,</member>
                       <member>Its changes of sun and cloud, of laughter and tears,</member>
                       <member>Its bottomless danger-pits and swallowing gulfs,</member>
                       <member>Its fear and joy and ecstasy and despair,</member>
                       <member>Its occult wizardries, its simple lines</member>
                       <member>And great communions and uplifting moves,</member>
                       <member>Its faith in heaven, its intercourse with hell.</member>
                       <member>These powers were not blunt with the dead weight of earth,</member>
                       <member>They gave ambrosia's taste and poison's sting.</member>
                       <member>There was an ardour in the gaze of Life</member>
                       <member>That saw heaven blue in the grey air of Night:</member>
                       <member>The impulses godward soared on passion's wings.</member>
                       <member>Mind's quick-paced thoughts floated from their high necks,</member>
                       <member>A glowing splendour as of an irised mane,</member>
                       <member>A parure of pure intuition's light;</member>
                       <member>Its flame-foot gallop they could imitate:</member>
                       <member>Mind's voices mimicked inspiration's stress,</member>
                       <member>Its ictus of infallibility,</member>
                       <member>Its speed and lightning heaven-leap of the Gods.</member>
                       <member>A trenchant blade that shore the nets of doubt,</member>
                       <member>Its sword of discernment seemed almost divine.</member>
                       <member>Yet all that knowledge was a borrowed sun's;</member>
                       <member>The forms that came were not heaven's native births:</member>
                       <member>An inner voice could speak the unreal's Word;</member>
                       <member>Its puissance dangerous and absolute</member>
                       <member>Could mingle poison with the wine of God.</member>
                       <member>On these high shining backs falsehood could ride;</member>
                       <member>Truth lay with delight in error's passionate arms</member>
                       <member>Gliding downstream in a blithe gilded barge:</member>
                       <member>She edged her ray with a magnificent lie.</member>
                       <member>Here in Life's nether realms all contraries meet;</member>
                       <member>Truth stares and does her works with bandaged eyes</member>
                       <member>And Ignorance is Wisdom's patron here:</member>
                       <member>Those galloping hooves in their enthusiast speed</member>
                       <member>Could bear to a dangerous intermediate zone</member>
                       <member>Where Death walks wearing a robe of deathless Life.</member>
                       <member>Or they enter the valley of the wandering Gleam</member>
                       <member>Whence, captives or victims of the specious Ray,</member>
                       <member>Souls trapped in that region never can escape.</member>
                       <member>Agents, not masters, they serve Life's desires</member>
                       <member>Toiling for ever in the snare of Time.</member>
                       <member>Their bodies born out of some Nihil's womb</member>
                       <member>Ensnare the spirit in the moment's dreams,</member>
                       <member>Then perish vomiting the immortal soul</member>
                       <member>Out of Matter's belly into the sink of Nought.</member>
                       <member>Yet some uncaught, unslain, can warily pass</member>
                       <member>Carrying Truth's image in the sheltered heart,</member>
                       <member>Pluck Knowledge out of error's screening grip,</member>
                       <member>Break paths through the blind walls of little self,</member>
                       <member>Then travel on to reach a greater life.</member>
                       <member>All this streamed past her and seemed to her vision's sight</member>
                       <member>As if around a high and voiceless isle</member>
                       <member>A clamour of waters from far unknown hills</member>
                       <member>Swallowed its narrow banks in crowding waves</member>
                       <member>And made a hungry world of white wild foam:</member>
                       <member>Hastening, a dragon with a million feet,</member>
                       <member>Its foam and cry a drunken giant's din,</member>
                       <member>Tossing a mane of Darkness into God's sky,</member>
                       <member>It ebbed receding into a distant roar.</member>
                       <member>Then smiled again a large and tranquil air:</member>
                       <member>Blue heaven, green earth, partners of Beauty's reign,</member>
                       <member>Lived as of old, companions in happiness;</member>
                       <member>And in the world's heart laughed the joy of life.</member>
                       <member>All now was still, the soil shone dry and pure.</member>
                       <member>Through it all she moved not, plunged not in the vain waves.</member>
                       <member>Out of the vastness of the silent self</member>
                       <member>Life's clamour fled; her spirit was mute and free.</member>

                       <member>Longed once to hasten like them to save God's world;</member>
                       <member>But she reined back the high passion in her heart;</member>
                       <member>She knew that first she must discover her soul.</member>
                       <member>Only who save themselves can others save.</member>
                       <member>In contrary sense she faced life's riddling truth:</member>
                       <member>They carrying the light to suffering men</member>
                       <member>Hurried with eager feet to the outer world;</member>
                       <member>Her eyes were turned towards the eternal source.</member>
                       <member>Outstretching her hands to stay the throng she cried:</member>
                       <member>"O happy company of luminous gods,</member>
                       <member>Reveal, who know, the road that I must tread,—</member>
                       <member>For surely that bright quarter is your home,—</member>
                       <member>To find the birthplace of the occult Fire</member>
                       <member>And the deep mansion of my secret soul."</member>
                       <member>One answered pointing to a silence dim</member>
                       <member>On a remote extremity of sleep</member>
                       <member>In some far background of the inner world.</member>
                       <member>"O Savitri, from thy hidden soul we come.</member>
                       <member>We are the messengers, the occult gods</member>
                       <member>Who help men's drab and heavy ignorant lives</member>
                       <member>To wake to beauty and the wonder of things</member>
                       <member>Touching them with glory and divinity;</member>
                       <member>In evil we light the deathless flame of good</member>
                       <member>And hold the torch of knowledge on ignorant roads;</member>
                       <member>We are thy will and all men's will towards Light.</member>
                       <member>O human copy and disguise of God</member>
                       <member>Who seekst the deity thou keepest hid</member>
                       <member>And livest by the Truth thou hast not known,</member>
                       <member>Follow the world's winding highway to its source.</member>
                       <member>There in the silence few have ever reached,</member>
                       <member>Thou shalt see the Fire burning on the bare stone</member>
                       <member>And the deep cavern of thy secret soul."</member>
                       <member>Then Savitri following the great winding road</member>
                       <member>Came where it dwindled into a narrow path</member>
                       <member>Trod only by rare wounded pilgrim feet.</member>
                       <member>A few bright forms emerged from unknown depths</member>
                       <member>And looked at her with calm immortal eyes.</member>
                       <member>There was no sound to break the brooding hush;</member>
                       <member>One felt the silent nearness of the soul.</member>

                       <member>Her eyes were dim with the ancient stain of tears.</member>
                       <member>Her heart was riven with the world's agony</member>
                       <member>And burdened with the sorrow and struggle in Time,</member>
                       <member>An anguished music trailed in her rapt voice.</member>

                       <member>In soft sweet training words slowly she spoke:</member>
                       <member>"O Savitri, I am thy secret soul.</member>
                       <member>To share the suffering of the world I came,</member>
                       <member>I draw my children's pangs into my breast.</member>
                       <member>I am the nurse of the dolour beneath the stars;</member>

                       <member>Under the ruthless harrow of the Gods.</member>
                       <member>I am woman, nurse and slave and beaten beast;</member>
                       <member>I tend the hands that gave me cruel blows.</member>
                       <member>The hearts that spurned my love and zeal I serve;</member>
                       <member>I am the courted queen, the pampered doll,</member>
                       <member>I am the giver of the bowl of rice,</member>
                       <member>I am the worshipped Angel of the House.</member>
                       <member>I am in all that suffers and that cries.</member>
                       <member>Mine is the prayer that climbs in vain from earth,</member>
                       <member>I am traversed by my creatures' agonies,</member>
                       <member>I am the spirit in a world of pain.</member>
                       <member>The scream of tortured flesh and tortured hearts</member>
                       <member>Fall'n back on heart and flesh unheard by Heaven</member>
                       <member>Has rent with helpless grief and wrath my soul.</member>
                       <member>I have seen the peasant burning in his hut,</member>
                       <member>I have seen the slashed corpse of the slaughtered child,</member>
                       <member>Heard woman's cry ravished and stripped and haled</member>
                       <member>Amid the bayings of the hell-hound mob,</member>
                       <member>I have looked on, I had no power to save.</member>
                       <member>I have brought no arm of strength to aid or slay;</member>
                       <member>God gave me love, he gave me not his force.</member>
                       <member>I have shared the toil of the yoked animal drudge</member>
                       <member>Pushed by the goad, encouraged by the whip;</member>
                       <member>I have shared the fear-filled life of bird and beast,</member>
                       <member>Its long hunt for the day's precarious food,</member>
                       <member>Its covert slink and crouch and hungry prowl,</member>
                       <member>Its pain and terror seized by beak and claw.</member>
                       <member>I have shared the daily life of common men,</member>
                       <member>Its petty pleasures and its petty cares,</member>
                       <member>Its press of troubles and haggard horde of ills,</member>
                       <member>Earth's trail of sorrow hopeless of relief,</member>
                       <member>The unwanted tedious labour without joy,</member>
                       <member>And the burden of misery and the strokes of fate.</member>
                       <member>I have been pity, leaning over pain</member>
                       <member>And the tender smile that heals the wounded heart</member>
                       <member>And sympathy making life less hard to bear.</member>
                       <member>Man has felt near my unseen face and hands;</member>
                       <member>I have become the sufferer and his moan,</member>
                       <member>I have lain down with the mangled and the slain,</member>
                       <member>I have lived with the prisoner in his dungeon cell.</member>
                       <member>Heavy on my shoulders weighs the yoke of Time:</member>
                       <member>Nothing refusing of creation's load,</member>
                       <member>I have borne all and know I still must bear:</member>
                       <member>Perhaps when the world sinks into a last sleep,</member>
                       <member>I too may sleep in dumb eternal peace.</member>
                       <member>I have borne the calm indifference of Heaven,</member>
                       <member>Watched Nature's cruelty to suffering things</member>
                       <member>While God passed silent by nor turned to help.</member>
                       <member>Yet have I cried not out against his will,</member>
                       <member>Yet have I not accused his cosmic Law.</member>
                       <member>Only to change this great hard world of pain</member>
                       <member>A patient prayer has risen from my breast;</member>
                       <member>A pallid resignation lights my brow,</member>
                       <member>Within me a blind faith and mercy dwell;</member>
                       <member>I carry the fire that never can be quenched</member>
                       <member>And the compassion that supports the suns.</member>
                       <member>I am the hope that looks towards my God,</member>
                       <member>My God who never came to me till now;</member>
                       <member>His voice I hear that ever says 'I come':</member>
                       <member>I know that one day he shall come at last."</member>
                       <member>She ceased, and like an echo from below</member>
                       <member>Answering her pathos of divine complaint</member>
                       <member>A voice of wrath took up the dire refrain,</member>
                       <member>A growl of thunder or roar of angry beast,</member>
                       <member>The beast that crouching growls within man's depths,—</member>
                       <member>Voice of a tortured Titan once a God.</member>
                       <member>"I am the Man of Sorrows, I am he</member>
                       <member>Who is nailed on the wide cross of the universe;</member>
                       <member>To enjoy my agony God built the earth,</member>
                       <member>My passion he has made his drama's theme.</member>
                       <member>He has sent me naked into his bitter world</member>
                       <member>And beaten me with his rods of grief and pain</member>
                       <member>That I might cry and grovel at his feet</member>
                       <member>And offer him worship with my blood and tears.</member>
                       <member>I am Prometheus under the vulture's beak,</member>
                       <member>Man the discoverer of the undying fire,</member>
                       <member>In the flame he kindled burning like a moth;</member>
                       <member>I am the seeker who can never find,</member>
                       <member>I am the fighter who can never win,</member>
                       <member>I am the runner who never touched his goal:</member>
                       <member>Hell tortures me with the edges of my thought,</member>
                       <member>Heaven tortures me with the splendour of my dreams.</member>
                       <member>What profit have I of my animal birth;</member>
                       <member>What profit have I of my human soul?</member>
                       <member>I toil like the animal, like the animal die.</member>
                       <member>I am man the rebel, man the helpless serf;</member>
                       <member>Fate and my fellows cheat me of my wage.</member>
                       <member>I loosen with my blood my servitude's seal</member>
                       <member>And shake from my aching neck the oppressor's knees</member>
                       <member>Only to seat new tyrants on my back:</member>
                       <member>My teachers lesson me in slavery,</member>
                       <member>I am shown God's stamp and my own signature</member>
                       <member>Upon the sorry contract of my fate.</member>
                       <member>I have loved, but none has loved me since my birth;</member>
                       <member>My fruit of works is given to other hands.</member>
                       <member>All that is left me is my evil thoughts,</member>
                       <member>My sordid quarrel against God and man,</member>
                       <member>Envy of the riches that I cannot share,</member>
                       <member>Hate of a happiness that is not mine.</member>
                       <member>I know my fate will ever be the same,</member>
                       <member>It is my nature's work that cannot change:</member>
                       <member>I have loved for mine, not for the beloved's sake,</member>
                       <member>I have lived for myself and not for others' lives.</member>
                       <member>Each in himself is sole by Nature's law.</member>
                       <member>So God has made his harsh and dreadful world,</member>
                       <member>So has he built the petty heart of man.</member>
                       <member>Only by force and ruse can man survive:</member>
                       <member>For pity is a weakness in his breast,</member>
                       <member>His goodness is a laxity in the nerves,</member>
                       <member>His kindness an investment for return,</member>
                       <member>His altruism is ego's other face:</member>
                       <member>He serves the world that him the world may serve.</member>
                       <member>If once the Titan's strength could wake in me,</member>
                       <member>If Enceladus from Etna could arise,</member>
                       <member>I then would reign the master of the world</member>
                       <member>And like a god enjoy man's bliss and pain.</member>
                       <member>But God has taken from me the ancient Force.</member>
                       <member>There is a dull consent in my sluggish heart,</member>
                       <member>A fierce satisfaction with my special pangs</member>
                       <member>As if they made me taller than my kind;</member>
                       <member>Only by suffering can I excel.</member>
                       <member>I am the victim of titanic ills,</member>
                       <member>I am the doer of demoniac deeds;</member>
                       <member>I was made for evil, evil is my lot;</member>
                       <member>Evil I must be and by evil live;</member>
                       <member>Nought other can I do but be myself;</member>
                       <member>What Nature made me, that I must remain.</member>
                       <member>I suffer and toil and weep; I moan and hate."</member>
                       <member>And Savitri heard the voice, the echo heard</member>
                       <member>And turning to her being of pity spoke:</member>
                       <member>"Madonna of suffering, Mother of grief divine,</member>

                       <member>I have conquered Space and knitted close all earth.</member>

                       <member>Here, living centre of that vision of peace,</member>

                       <member>A low music heard became her floating voice:</member>

                       <member>I have come down to the wounded desolate earth</member>
                       <member>To heal her pangs and lull her heart to rest</member>
                       <member>And lay her head upon the Mother's lap</member>
                       <member>That she may dream of God and know his peace</member>

                       <member>I reveal to her in the body of their power.</member>
                       <member>I am peace that steals into man's war-worn breast,</member>
                       <member>Amid the reign of Hell his acts create</member>

                       <member>Where his largest knowledge is an ignorance,</member>
                       <member>I am the Power that labours towards the best</member>
                       <member>And works for God and looks up towards the heights.</member>
                       <member>I make even sin and error stepping-stones</member>

                       <member>Out of the Inconscient I build consciousness,</member>
                       <member>And lead through death to reach immortal Life.</member>
                       <member>Many are God's forms by which he grows in man;</member>
                       <member>They stamp his thoughts and deeds with divinity,</member>
                       <member>Uplift the stature of the human clay</member>
                       <member>Or slowly transmute it into heaven's gold.</member>
                       <member>He is the Good for which men fight and die,</member>
                       <member>He is the war of Right with Titan wrong;</member>
                       <member>He is Freedom rising deathless from her pyre;</member>
                       <member>He is Valour guarding still the desperate pass</member>
                       <member>Or lone and erect on the shattered barricade</member>
                       <member>Or a sentinel in the dangerous echoing Night.</member>
                       <member>He is the crown of the martyr burned in flame</member>
                       <member>And the glad resignation of the saint</member>
                       <member>And courage indifferent to the wounds of Time</member>
                       <member>And the hero's might wrestling with death and fate.</member>
                       <member>He is Wisdom incarnate on a glorious throne</member>
                       <member>And the calm autocracy of the sage's rule.</member>
                       <member>He is the high and solitary Thought</member>
                       <member>Aloof above the ignorant multitude:</member>
                       <member>He is the prophet's voice, the sight of the seer.</member>
                       <member>He is Beauty, nectar of the passionate soul,</member>
                       <member>He is the Truth by which the spirit lives.</member>
                       <member>He is the riches of the spiritual Vast</member>
                       <member>Poured out in healing streams on indigent Life;</member>
                       <member>He is Eternity lured from hour to hour,</member>
                       <member>He is infinity in a little space:</member>
                       <member>He is immortality in the arms of death.</member>
                       <member>These powers I am and at my call they come.</member>
                       <member>Thus slowly I lift man's soul nearer the Light.</member>
                       <member>But human mind clings to its ignorance</member>
                       <member>And to its littleness the human heart</member>
                       <member>And to its right to grief the earthly life.</member>
                       <member>Only when Eternity takes Time by the hand,</member>
                       <member>Only when infinity weds the finite's thought,</member>
                       <member>Can man be free from himself and live with God.</member>
                       <member>I bring meanwhile the gods upon the earth;</member>
                       <member>I bring back hope to the despairing heart;</member>
                       <member>I give peace to the humble and the great,</member>
                       <member>And shed my grace on the foolish and the wise.</member>
                       <member>I shall save earth, if earth consents to be saved.</member>
                       <member>Then Love shall at last unwounded tread earth's soil;</member>
                       <member>Man's mind shall admit the sovereignty of Truth</member>
                       <member>And body bear the immense descent of God."</member>
                       <member>She spoke and from the ignorant nether plane</member>
                       <member>A cry, a warped echo naked and shuddering came.</member>
                       <member>A voice of the sense-shackled human mind</member>
                       <member>Carried its proud complaint of godlike power</member>
                       <member>Hedged by the limits of a mortal's thoughts,</member>
                       <member>Bound in the chains of earthly ignorance.</member>
                       <member>Imprisoned in his body and his brain</member>
                       <member>The mortal cannot see God's mighty whole,</member>
                       <member>Or share in his vast and deep identity</member>
                       <member>Who stands unguessed within our ignorant hearts</member>
                       <member>And knows all things because he is one with all.</member>
                       <member>Man only sees the cosmic surfaces.</member>
                       <member>Then wondering what may lie hid from the sense</member>
                       <member>A little way he delves to depths below:</member>
                       <member>But soon he stops, he cannot reach life's core</member>
                       <member>Or commune with the throbbing heart of things.</member>
                       <member>He sees the naked body of the Truth</member>
                       <member>Though often baffled by her endless garbs,</member>
                       <member>But cannot look upon her soul within.</member>
                       <member>Then, furious for a knowledge absolute,</member>
                       <member>He tears all details out and stabs and digs:</member>
                       <member>Only the shape's contents he holds for use;</member>
                       <member>The spirit escapes or dies beneath his knife.</member>
                       <member>He sees as a blank stretch, a giant waste</member>
                       <member>The crowding riches of infinity.</member>
                       <member>The finite he has made his central field,</member>
                       <member>Its plan dissects, masters its processes,</member>
                       <member>That which moves all is hidden from his gaze,</member>
                       <member>His poring eyes miss the unseen behind.</member>
                       <member>He has the blind man's subtle unerring touch</member>
                       <member>Or the slow traveller's sight of distant scenes;</member>
                       <member>The soul's revealing contacts are not his.</member>
                       <member>Yet is he visited by intuitive light</member>
                       <member>And inspiration comes from the Unknown;</member>
                       <member>But only reason and sense he feels as sure,</member>
                       <member>They only are his trusted witnesses.</member>
                       <member>Thus is he baulked, his splendid effort vain;</member>
                       <member>His knowledge scans bright pebbles on the shore</member>
                       <member>Of the huge ocean of his ignorance.</member>
                       <member>Yet grandiose were the accents of that cry,</member>
                       <member>A cosmic pathos trembled in its tone.</member>
                       <member>"I am the mind of God's great ignorant world</member>

                       <member>I have classed the changes of her stony crust</member>
                       <member>And of her biography discovered the dates,</member>
                       <member>Rescued the pages of all Nature's plan.</member>

                       <member>The lofty burning of desire had sunk</member>
                       <member>Ashamed, a vanity of separate self,</member>

                       <member>As might a shadow walk in a shadowy scene,</member>

                       <member>A wave rippled within, the world had stirred;</member>
                       <member>Once more her inner self became her space.</member>
                       <member>There was felt a blissful nearness to the goal;</member>
                       <member>Heaven leaned low to kiss the sacred hill,</member>

                       <member>And knew the dwelling of her secret soul.</member>
                       <member>As if in some Elysian occult depth,</member>
                       <member>Truth's last retreat from thought's profaning touch,</member>

                       <member>A marvellous brooding twilight met the eyes</member>
                       <member>And a holy stillness held that voiceless space.</member>
                       <member>An awful dimness wrapped the great rock-doors</member>
                       <member>Carved in the massive stone of Matter's trance.</member>
                       <member>Two golden serpents round the lintel curled,</member>

                       <member>An eagle covered it with wide conquering wings:</member>

                       <member>Doves crowded the grey musing cornices</member>
                       <member>Like sculptured postures of white-bosomed peace.</member>
                       <member>Across the threshold's sleep she entered in</member>
                       <member>And found herself amid great figures of gods</member>
                       <member>Conscious in stone and living without breath,</member>
                       <member>Watching with fixed regard the soul of man,</member>

                       <member>World-symbols of immutable potency.</member>
                       <member>On the walls covered with significant shapes</member>
                       <member>Looked at her the life-scene of man and beast</member>
                       <member>And the high meaning of the life of gods,</member>
                       <member>The power and necessity of these numberless worlds,</member>

                       <member>His figures and his small and mighty acts</member>
                       <member>And his passion and his birth and life and death</member>
                       <member>And his return to immortality.</member>
                       <member>To the abiding and eternal is their climb,</member>
                       <member>To the pure existence everywhere the same,</member>

                       <member>And yet is no one but himself apart.</member>
                       <member>There was no step of breathing men, no sound,</member>
                       <member>Only the living nearness of the soul.</member>
                       <member>Yet all the worlds and God himself were there,</member>

                       <member>All this she saw and inly felt and knew</member>
                       <member>Not by some thought of mind but by the self.</member>
                       <member>A light not born of sun or moon or fire,</member>

                       <member>Thoughts that enlarged our limited human range,</member>
                       <member>Lifted the ideal's half-quenched or sinking torch</member>
                       <member>Or peered through the finite at the infinite.</member>
                       <member>A sight opened upon the invisible</member>
                       <member>And sensed the shapes that mortal eyes see not,</member>
                       <member>The sounds that mortal listening cannot hear,</member>
                       <member>The blissful sweetness of the intangible's touch;</member>
                       <member>The objects that to us are empty air,</member>
                       <member>Are there the stuff of daily experience</member>
                       <member>And the common pabulum of sense and thought.</member>
                       <member>The beings of the subtle realms appeared</member>
                       <member>And scenes concealed behind our earthly scene;</member>
                       <member>She saw the life of remote continents</member>
                       <member>And distance deafened not to voices far;</member>
                       <member>She felt the movements crossing unknown minds;</member>
                       <member>The past's events occurred before her eyes.</member>
                       <member>The great world's thoughts were part of her own thought,</member>
                       <member>The feelings dumb for ever and unshared,</member>
                       <member>The ideas that never found an utterance.</member>
                       <member>The dim subconscient's incoherent hints</member>
                       <member>Laid bare a meaning twisted, deep and strange,</member>
                       <member>The bizarre secret of their fumbling speech,</member>
                       <member>Their links with underlying reality.</member>
                       <member>The unseen grew visible and audible:</member>
                       <member>Thoughts leaped down from a superconscient field</member>
                       <member>Like eagles swooping from a viewless peak,</member>
                       <member>Thoughts gleamed up from the screened subliminal depths</member>
                       <member>Like golden fishes from a hidden sea.</member>
                       <member>This world is a vast unbroken totality,</member>
                       <member>A deep solidarity joins its contrary powers;</member>
                       <member>God's summits look back on the mute Abyss.</member>
                       <member>So man evolving to divinest heights</member>
                       <member>Colloques still with the animal and the Djinn;</member>
                       <member>The human godhead with star-gazer eyes</member>
                       <member>Lives still in one house with the primal beast.</member>
                       <member>The high meets the low, all is a single plan.</member>
                       <member>So she beheld the many births of thought,</member>
                       <member>If births can be of what eternal is;</member>
                       <member>For the Eternal's powers are like himself,</member>
                       <member>Timeless in the Timeless, in Time ever born.</member>
                       <member>This too she saw that all in outer mind</member>
                       <member>Is made, not born, a product perishable,</member>
                       <member>Forged in the body's factory by earth-force.</member>
                       <member>This mind is a dynamic small machine</member>
                       <member>Producing ceaselessly, till it wears out,</member>
                       <member>With raw material drawn from the outside world,</member>
                       <member>The patterns sketched out by an artist God.</member>
                       <member>Often our thoughts are finished cosmic wares</member>
                       <member>Admitted by a silent office gate</member>
                       <member>And passed through the subconscient's galleries,</member>
                       <member>Then issued in Time's mart as private make.</member>
                       <member>For now they bear the living person's stamp;</member>
                       <member>A trick, a special hue claims them his own.</member>
                       <member>All else is Nature's craft and this too hers.</member>
                       <member>Our tasks are given, we are but instruments;</member>
                       <member>Nothing is all our own that we create:</member>
                       <member>The Power that acts in us is not our force.</member>
                       <member>The genius too receives from some high fount</member>
                       <member>Concealed in a supernal secrecy</member>
                       <member>The work that gives him an immortal name.</member>
                       <member>The word, the form, the charm, the glory and grace</member>
                       <member>Are missioned sparks from a stupendous Fire;</member>
                       <member>A sample from the laboratory of God</member>

                       <member>Comes to him wrapped in golden coverings;</member>
                       <member>He listens for Inspiration's postman knock</member>
                       <member>And takes delivery of the priceless gift</member>
                       <member>A little spoilt by the receiver mind</member>
                       <member>Or mixed with the manufacture of his brain;</member>
                       <member>When least defaced, then is it most divine.</member>

                       <member>Man is a dynamo for the cosmic work;</member>
                       <member>Nature does most in him, God the high rest:</member>

                       <member>This independent, once a power supreme,</member>

                       <member>Till he becomes her freedman—or God's slave.</member>
                       <member>This is the appearance in our mortal front;</member>
                       <member>Our greater truth of being lies behind:</member>
                       <member>Our consciousness is cosmic and immense,</member>
                       <member>But only when we break through Matter's wall</member>
                       <member>In that spiritual vastness can we stand</member>
                       <member>Where we can live the masters of our world</member>
                       <member>And mind is only a means and body a tool.</member>
                       <member>For above the birth of body and of thought</member>
                       <member>Our spirit's truth lives in the naked self</member>
                       <member>And from that height, unbound, surveys the world.</member>
                       <member>Out of the mind she rose to escape its law</member>
                       <member>That it might sleep in some deep shadow of self</member>
                       <member>Or fall silent in the silence of the Unseen.</member>
                       <member>High she attained and stood from Nature free</member>
                       <member>And saw creation's life from far above,</member>
                       <member>Thence upon all she laid her sovereign will</member>
                       <member>To dedicate it to God's timeless calm:</member>
                       <member>Then all grew tranquil in her being's space,</member>
                       <member>Only sometimes small thoughts arose and fell</member>
                       <member>Like quiet waves upon a silent sea</member>
                       <member>Or ripples passing over a lonely pool</member>
                       <member>When a stray stone disturbs its dreaming rest.</member>
                       <member>Yet the mind's factory had ceased to work,</member>
                       <member>There was no sound of the dynamo's throb,</member>
                       <member>There came no call from the still fields of life.</member>
                       <member>Then even those stirrings rose in her no more;</member>
                       <member>Her mind now seemed like a vast empty room</member>
                       <member>Or like a peaceful landscape without sound.</member>
                       <member>This men call quietude and prize as peace.</member>
                       <member>But to her deeper sight all yet was there,</member>
                       <member>Effervescing like a chaos under a lid;</member>
                       <member>Feelings and thoughts cried out for word and act</member>
                       <member>But found no response in the silenced brain:</member>
                       <member>All was suppressed but nothing yet expunged;</member>
                       <member>At every moment might explosion come.</member>
                       <member>Then this too paused; the body seemed a stone.</member>
                       <member>All now was a wide mighty vacancy,</member>
                       <member>But still excluded from eternity's hush;</member>
                       <member>For still was far the repose of the Absolute</member>
                       <member>And the ocean silence of Infinity.</member>
                       <member>Even now some thoughts could cross her solitude;</member>
                       <member>These surged not from the depths or from within</member>
                       <member>Cast up from formlessness to seek a form,</member>
                       <member>Spoke not the body's need nor voiced life's call.</member>
                       <member>These seemed not born nor made in human Time:</member>
                       <member>Children of cosmic Nature from a far world,</member>
                       <member>Idea's shapes in complete armour of words</member>
                       <member>Posted like travellers in an alien space.</member>
                       <member>Out of some far expanse they seemed to come</member>
                       <member>As if carried on vast wings like large white sails,</member>
                       <member>And with easy access reached the inner ear</member>
                       <member>As though they used a natural privileged right</member>
                       <member>To the high royal entries of the soul.</member>
                       <member>As yet their path lay deep-concealed in light.</member>
                       <member>Then looking to know whence the intruders came</member>
                       <member>She saw a spiritual immensity</member>
                       <member>Pervading and encompassing the world-space</member>
                       <member>As ether our transparent tangible air,</member>
                       <member>And through it sailing tranquilly a thought.</member>
                       <member>As smoothly glides a ship nearing its port,</member>
                       <member>Ignorant of embargo and blockade,</member>
                       <member>Confident of entrance and the visa's seal,</member>
                       <member>It came to the silent city of the brain</member>
                       <member>Towards its accustomed and expectant quay,</member>
                       <member>But met a barring will, a blow of Force</member>
                       <member>And sank vanishing in the immensity.</member>
                       <member>After a long vacant pause another appeared</member>
                       <member>And others one by one suddenly emerged,</member>
                       <member>Mind's unexpected visitors from the Unseen</member>
                       <member>Like far-off sails upon a lonely sea.</member>
                       <member>But soon that commerce failed, none reached mind's coast.</member>
                       <member>Then all grew still, nothing moved any more:</member>
                       <member>Immobile, self-rapt, timeless, solitary</member>
                       <member>A silent spirit pervaded silent Space.</member>

                    <simplelist>
                      <member>In that absolute stillness bare and formidable</member>
                       <member>There was glimpsed an all-negating Void Supreme</member>
                       <member>That claimed its mystic Nihil's sovereign right</member>
                       <member>To cancel Nature and deny the soul.</member>
                       <member>Even the nude sense of self grew pale and thin:</member>
                       <member>Impersonal, signless, featureless, void of forms</member>
                       <member>A blank pure consciousness had replaced the mind.</member>
                       <member>Her spirit seemed the substance of a name,</member>
                       <member>The world a pictured symbol drawn on self,</member>
                       <member>A dream of images, a dream of sounds</member>
                       <member>Built up the semblance of a universe</member>
                       <member>Or lent to spirit the appearance of a world.</member>
                       <member>This was self-seeing; in that intolerant hush</member>
                       <member>No notion and no concept could take shape,</member>
                       <member>There was no sense to frame the figure of things,</member>
                       <member>A sheer self-sight was there, no thought arose.</member>
                       <member>Emotion slept deep down in the still heart</member>
                       <member>Or lay buried in a cemetery of peace:</member>
                       <member>All feelings seemed quiescent, calm or dead,</member>
                       <member>As if the heart-strings rent could work no more</member>
                       <member>And joy and grief could never rise again.</member>
                       <member>The heart beat on with an unconscious rhythm</member>
                       <member>But no response came from it and no cry.</member>
                       <member>Vain was the provocation of events;</member>
                       <member>Nothing within answered an outside touch,</member>
                       <member>No nerve was stirred and no reaction rose.</member>
                       <member>Yet still her body saw and moved and spoke;</member>
                       <member>It understood without the aid of thought,</member>
                       <member>It said whatever needed to be said,</member>
                       <member>It did whatever needed to be done.</member>
                       <member>There was no person there behind the act,</member>
                       <member>No mind that chose or passed the fitting word:</member>
                       <member>All wrought like an unerring apt machine.</member>
                       <member>As if continuing old habitual turns,</member>
                       <member>And pushed by an old unexhausted force</member>
                       <member>The engine did the work for which it was made:</member>
                       <member>Her consciousness looked on and took no part;</member>
                       <member>All it upheld, in nothing had a share.</member>
                       <member>There was no strong initiator will;</member>
                       <member>An incoherence crossing a firm void</member>
                       <member>Slipped into an order of related chance.</member>
                       <member>A pure perception was the only power</member>
                       <member>That stood behind her action and her sight.</member>
                       <member>If that retired, all objects would be extinct,</member>
                       <member>Her private universe would cease to be,</member>
                       <member>The house she had built with bricks of thought and sense</member>
                       <member>In the beginning after the birth of Space.</member>
                       <member>This seeing was identical with the seen;</member>
                       <member>It knew without knowledge all that could be known,</member>
                       <member>It saw impartially the world go by,</member>
                       <member>But in the same supine unmoving glance</member>
                       <member>Saw too its abysmal unreality.</member>
                       <member>It watched the figure of the cosmic game,</member>
                       <member>But the thought and inner life in forms seemed dead,</member>
                       <member>Abolished by her own collapse of thought:</member>
                       <member>A hollow physical shell persisted still.</member>
                       <member>All seemed a brilliant shadow of itself,</member>
                       <member>A cosmic film of scenes and images:</member>
                       <member>The enduring mass and outline of the hills</member>
                       <member>Was a design sketched on a silent mind</member>
                       <member>And held to a tremulous false solidity</member>
                       <member>By constant beats of visionary sight.</member>
                       <member>The forest with its emerald multitudes</member>
                       <member>Clothed with its show of hues vague empty Space,</member>
                       <member>A painting's colours hiding a surface void</member>
                       <member>That flickered upon dissolution's edge;</member>
                       <member>The blue heavens, an illusion of the eyes,</member>
                       <member>Roofed in the mind's illusion of a world.</member>
                       <member>The men who walked beneath an unreal sky</member>
                       <member>Seemed mobile puppets out of cardboard cut</member>
                       <member>And pushed by unseen hands across the soil</member>
                       <member>Or moving pictures upon Fancy's film:</member>
                       <member>There was no soul within, no power of life.</member>
                       <member>The brain's vibrations that appear like thought,</member>
                       <member>The nerve's brief answer to each contact's knock,</member>
                       <member>The heart's quiverings felt as joy and grief and love</member>
                       <member>Were twitchings of the body, their seeming self,</member>
                       <member>That body forged from atoms and from gas</member>
                       <member>A manufactured lie of Maya's make,</member>
                       <member>Its life a dream seen by the sleeping Void.</member>
                       <member>The animals lone or trooping through the glades</member>
                       <member>Fled like a passing vision of beauty and grace</member>
                       <member>Imagined by some all-creating Eye.</member>
                       <member>Yet something was there behind the fading scene;</member>
                       <member>Wherever she turned, at whatsoever she looked,</member>
                       <member>It was perceived, yet hid from mind and sight.</member>
                       <member>The One only real shut itself from Space</member>
                       <member>And stood aloof from the idea of Time.</member>
                       <member>Its truth escaped from shape and line and hue.</member>
                       <member>All else grew unsubstantial, self-annulled,</member>
                       <member>This only everlasting seemed and true,</member>
                       <member>Yet nowhere dwelt, it was outside the hours.</member>
                       <member>This only could justify the labour of sight,</member>
                       <member>But sight could not define for it a form;</member>
                       <member>This only could appease the unsatisfied ear</member>
                       <member>But hearing listened in vain for a missing sound;</member>
                       <member>This answered not the sense, called not to Mind.</member>
                       <member>It met her as the uncaught inaudible Voice</member>
                       <member>That speaks for ever from the Unknowable.</member>
                       <member>It met her like an omnipresent point</member>
                       <member>Pure of dimensions, unfixed, invisible,</member>
                       <member>The single oneness of its multiplied beat</member>
                       <member>Accentuating its sole eternity.</member>
                       <member>It faced her as some vast Nought's immensity,</member>
                       <member>An endless No to all that seems to be,</member>
                       <member>An endless Yes to things ever unconceived</member>
                       <member>And all that is unimagined and unthought,</member>
                       <member>An eternal zero or untotalled Aught,</member>
                       <member>A spaceless and a placeless Infinite.</member>
                       <member>Yet eternity and infinity seemed but words</member>
                       <member>Vainly affixed by mind's incompetence</member>
                       <member>To its stupendous lone reality.</member>
                       <member>The world is but a spark-burst from its light,</member>
                       <member>All moments flashes from its Timelessness,</member>
                       <member>All objects glimmerings of the Bodiless</member>
                       <member>That disappear from Mind when That is seen.</member>
                       <member>It held, as if a shield before its face,</member>
                       <member>A consciousness that saw without a seer,</member>
                       <member>The Truth where knowledge is not nor knower nor known,</member>
                       <member>The Love enamoured of its own delight</member>
                       <member>In which the Lover is not nor the Beloved</member>
                       <member>Bringing their personal passion into the Vast,</member>
                       <member>The Force omnipotent in quietude,</member>
                       <member>The Bliss that none can ever hope to taste.</member>
                       <member>It cancelled the convincing cheat of self;</member>
                       <member>A truth in nothingness was its mighty clue.</member>
                       <member>If all existence could renounce to be</member>
                       <member>And Being take refuge in Non-being's arms</member>
                       <member>And Non-being could strike out its ciphered round,</member>
                       <member>Some lustre of that Reality might appear.</member>
                       <member>A formless liberation came on her.</member>
                       <member>Once sepulchred alive in brain and flesh</member>
                       <member>She had risen up from body, mind and life;</member>
                       <member>She was no more a Person in a world,</member>
                       <member>She had escaped into infinity.</member>
                       <member>What once had been herself had disappeared;</member>
                       <member>There was no frame of things, no figure of soul.</member>
                       <member>A refugee from the domain of sense,</member>
                       <member>Evading the necessity of thought,</member>
                       <member>Delivered from Knowledge and from Ignorance</member>
                       <member>And rescued from the true and the untrue,</member>
                       <member>She shared the Superconscient's high retreat</member>
                       <member>Beyond the self-born Word, the nude Idea,</member>
                       <member>The first bare solid ground of consciousness;</member>
                       <member>Beings were not there, existence had no place,</member>
                       <member>There was no temptation of the joy to be.</member>
                       <member>Unutterably effaced, no one and null,</member>
                       <member>A vanishing vestige like a violet trace,</member>

                       <member>Annihilation's vague indefinable step:</member>
                       <member>A memory of being still was there</member>
                       <member>And kept her separate from nothingness:</member>
                       <member>She was in That but still became not That.</member>
                       <member>This shadow of herself so close to nought</member>
                       <member>Could be again self's point d'appui to live,</member>

                       <member>Even as the Unknowable decreed,</member>
                       <member>She might be nought or new-become the All,</member>

                       <member>Even, she might learn what the mystic cipher held,</member>
                       <member>This seeming exit or closed end of all</member>
                       <member>Could be a blind tenebrous passage screened from sight,</member>
                       <member>Her state the eclipsing shell of a darkened sun</member>
                       <member>On its secret way to the Ineffable.</member>
                       <member>Even now her splendid being might flame back</member>
                       <member>Out of the silence and the nullity,</member>
                       <member>A gleaming portion of the All-Wonderful,</member>
                       <member>A power of some all-affirming Absolute,</member>
                       <member>A shining mirror of the eternal Truth</member>
                       <member>To show to the One-in-all its manifest face,</member>
                       <member>To the souls of men their deep identity.</member>
                       <member>Or she might wake into God's quietude</member>
                       <member>Beyond the cosmic day and cosmic night</member>
                       <member>And rest appeased in his white eternity.</member>
                       <member>But this was now unreal or remote</member>
                       <member>Or covered in the mystic fathomless blank.</member>
                       <member>In infinite Nothingness was the ultimate sign</member>
                       <member>Or else the Real was the Unknowable.</member>
                       <member>A lonely Absolute negated all:</member>

                       <member>As if earth ever the same could for ever keep</member>
                       <member>The living spirit and body in her clasp,</member>

                       <member>To all she was the same perfect Savitri:</member>
                       <member>A greatness and a sweetness and a light</member>
                       <member>Poured out from her upon her little world.</member>
                       <member>Life showed to all the same familiar face,</member>
                       <member>Her acts followed the old unaltered round,</member>

                       <member>Around her soul's muteness all moved as of old;</member>
                       <member>A vacant consciousness watched from within,</member>
                       <member>Empty of all but bare Reality.</member>
                       <member>There was no will behind the word and act,</member>
                       <member>No thought formed in her brain to guide the speech:</member>
                       <member>An impersonal emptiness walked and spoke in her,</member>
                       <member>Something perhaps unfelt, unseen, unknown</member>
                       <member>Guarded the body for its future work,</member>
                       <member>Or Nature moved in her old stream of force.</member>
                       <member>Perhaps she bore made conscious in her breast</member>
                       <member>The miraculous Nihil, origin of our souls</member>
                       <member>And source and sum of the vast world's events,</member>
                       <member>The womb and grave of thought, a cipher of God,</member>
                       <member>A zero circle of being's totality.</member>
                       <member>It used her speech and acted in her acts,</member>
                       <member>It was beauty in her limbs, life in her breath;</member>
                       <member>The original Mystery wore her human face.</member>
                       <member>Thus was she lost within to separate self;</member>
                       <member>Her mortal ego perished in God's night.</member>
                       <member>Only a body was left, the ego's shell</member>
                       <member>Afloat mid drift and foam of the world-sea,</member>
                       <member>A sea of dream watched by a motionless sense</member>
                       <member>In a figure of unreal reality.</member>
                       <member>An impersonal foresight could already see,—</member>
                       <member>In the unthinking knowledge of the spirit</member>
                       <member>Even now it seemed nigh done, inevitable,—</member>
                       <member>The individual die, the cosmos pass;</member>
                       <member>These gone, the transcendental grew a myth,</member>
                       <member>The Holy Ghost without the Father and Son,</member>
                       <member>Or, a substratum of what once had been,</member>
                       <member>Being that never willed to bear a world</member>
                       <member>Restored to its original loneliness,</member>
                       <member>Impassive, sole, silent, intangible.</member>
                       <member>Yet all was not extinct in this deep loss;</member>
                       <member>The being travelled not towards nothingness.</member>
                       <member>There was some high surpassing Secrecy,</member>
                       <member>And when she sat alone with Satyavan,</member>
                       <member>Her moveless mind with his that searched and strove,</member>
                       <member>In the hush of the profound and intimate night</member>
                       <member>She turned to the face of a veiled voiceless Truth</member>
                       <member>Hid in the dumb recesses of the heart</member>
                       <member>Or waiting beyond the last peak climbed by Thought,—</member>
                       <member>Unseen itself it sees the struggling world</member>
                       <member>And prompts our quest, but cares not to be found,—</member>
                       <member>Out of that distant Vast came a reply.</member>
                       <member>Something unknown, unreached, inscrutable</member>
                       <member>Sent down the messages of its bodiless Light,</member>
                       <member>Cast lightning flashes of a thought not ours</member>
                       <member>Crossing the immobile silence of her mind:</member>
                       <member>In its might of irresponsible sovereignty</member>
                       <member>It seized on speech to give those flamings shape,</member>
                       <member>Made beat the heart of wisdom in a word</member>
                       <member>And spoke immortal things through mortal lips.</member>
                       <member>Or, listening to the sages of the woods,</member>
                       <member>In question and in answer broke from her</member>
                       <member>High strange revealings impossible to men,</member>
                       <member>Something or someone secret and remote</member>
                       <member>Took hold of her body for his mystic use,</member>
                       <member>Her mouth was seized to channel ineffable truths,</member>
                       <member>Knowledge unthinkable found an utterance.</member>
                       <member>Astonished by a new enlightenment,</member>
                       <member>Invaded by a streak of the Absolute,</member>
                       <member>They marvelled at her, for she seemed to know</member>
                       <member>What they had only glimpsed at times afar.</member>
                       <member>These thoughts were formed not in her listening brain,</member>
                       <member>Her vacant heart was like a stringless harp;</member>
                       <member>Impassive the body claimed not its own voice,</member>
                       <member>But let the luminous greatness through it pass.</member>
                       <member>A dual Power at being's occult poles</member>
                       <member>Still acted, nameless and invisible:</member>
                       <member>Her divine emptiness was their instrument.</member>
                       <member>Inconscient Nature dealt with the world it had made,</member>
                       <member>And using still the body's instruments</member>
                       <member>Slipped through the conscious void she had become;</member>
                       <member>The superconscient Mystery through that Void</member>
                       <member>Missioned its word to touch the thoughts of men.</member>
                       <member>As yet this great impersonal speech was rare.</member>
                       <member>But now the unmoving wide spiritual space</member>
                       <member>In which her mind survived tranquil and bare,</member>
                       <member>Admitted a traveller from the cosmic breadths:</member>
                       <member>A thought came through draped as an outer voice.</member>
                       <member>It called not for the witness of the mind,</member>
                       <member>It spoke not to the hushed receiving heart;</member>
                       <member>It came direct to the pure perception's seat,</member>
                       <member>An only centre now of consciousness,</member>
                       <member>If centre could be where all seemed only space;</member>
                       <member>No more shut in by body's walls and gates</member>
                       <member>Her being, a circle without circumference,</member>
                       <member>Already now surpassed all cosmic bounds</member>
                       <member>And more and more spread into infinity.</member>
                       <member>This being was its own unbounded world,</member>
                       <member>A world without form or feature or circumstance;</member>
                       <member>It had no ground, no wall, no roof of thought,</member>
                       <member>Yet saw itself and looked on all around</member>
                       <member>In a silence motionless and illimitable.</member>
                       <member>There was no person there, no centred mind,</member>
                       <member>No seat of feeling on which beat events</member>
                       <member>Or objects wrought and shaped reaction's stress.</member>
                       <member>There was no motion in this inner world,</member>
                       <member>All was a still and even infinity.</member>
                       <member>In her the Unseen, the Unknown waited his hour.</member>

                <title>Canto Three: Death in the Forest
                    <footnote><para>The Book of Death was taken from Canto Three of an early version of 
                        <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> which had only six cantos and an epilogue. It was slightly revised at a late stage and a number of new lines were added, but it was never fully worked into the final version of the poem. Its original designation, "Canto Three", has been retained as a reminder of this.</para></footnote>

                       <member>Should let pass into the mother's unknowing breast,</member>
                       <member>Slaying all happiness and need to live,</member>

                       <member>In the iron ring of the enormous peaks</member>
                       <member>Under the blue rifts of the forest sky,</member>
                       <member>I have not gone into the silences</member>
                       <member>Of this great woodland that enringed my thoughts</member>
                       <member>With mystery, nor in its green miracles</member>
                       <member>Wandered, but this small clearing was my world.</member>
                       <member>Now has a strong desire seized all my heart</member>
                       <member>To go with Satyavan holding his hand</member>
                       <member>Into the life that he has loved and touch</member>
                       <member>Herbs he has trod and know the forest flowers</member>
                       <member>And hear at ease the birds and the scurrying life</member>
                       <member>That starts and ceases, rich far rustle of boughs</member>
                       <member>And all the mystic whispering of the woods.</member>
                       <member>Release me now and let my heart have rest."</member>
                       <member>She answered: "Do as thy wise mind desires,</member>
                       <member>O calm child-sovereign with the eyes that rule.</member>
                       <member>I hold thee for a strong goddess who has come</member>
                       <member>Pitying our barren days; so dost thou serve</member>
                       <member>Even as a slave might, yet art thou beyond</member>
                       <member>All that thou doest, all our minds conceive,</member>
                       <member>Like the strong sun that serves earth from above."</member>
                       <member>Then the doomed husband and the woman who knew</member>
                       <member>Went with linked hands into that solemn world</member>
                       <member>Where beauty and grandeur and unspoken dream,</member>
                       <member>Where Nature's mystic silence could be felt</member>
                       <member>Communing with the secrecy of God.</member>
                       <member>Beside her Satyavan walked full of joy</member>
                       <member>Because she moved with him through his green haunts:</member>
                       <member>He showed her all the forest's riches, flowers</member>
                       <member>Innumerable of every odour and hue</member>
                       <member>And soft thick clinging creepers red and green</member>
                       <member>And strange rich-plumaged birds, to every cry</member>
                       <member>That haunted sweetly distant boughs replied</member>
                       <member>With the shrill singer's name more sweetly called.</member>
                       <member>He spoke of all the things he loved: they were</member>
                       <member>His boyhood's comrades and his playfellows,</member>
                       <member>Coevals and companions of his life</member>
                       <member>Here in this world whose every mood he knew:</member>
                       <member>Their thoughts which to the common mind are blank,</member>
                       <member>He shared, to every wild emotion felt</member>
                       <member>An answer. Deeply she listened, but to hear</member>
                       <member>The voice that soon would cease from tender words</member>
                       <member>And treasure its sweet cadences beloved</member>
                       <member>For lonely memory when none by her walked</member>
                       <member>And the beloved voice could speak no more.</member>
                       <member>But little dwelt her mind upon their sense;</member>
                       <member>Of death, not life she thought or life's lone end.</member>
                       <member>Love in her bosom hurt with the jagged edges</member>
                       <member>Of anguish moaned at every step with pain</member>
                       <member>Crying, "Now, now perhaps his voice will cease</member>
                       <member>For ever." Even by some vague touch oppressed</member>
                       <member>Sometimes her eyes looked round as if their orbs</member>
                       <member>Might see the dim and dreadful god's approach.</member>
                       <member>But Satyavan had paused. He meant to finish</member>
                       <member>His labour here that happy, linked, uncaring</member>
                       <member>They two might wander free in the green deep</member>
                       <member>Primaeval mystery of the forest's heart.</member>
                       <member>A tree that raised its tranquil head to heaven</member>
                       <member>Luxuriating in verdure, summoning</member>
                       <member>The breeze with amorous wideness of its boughs,</member>
                       <member>He chose and with his steel assailed the arm</member>
                       <member>Brown, rough and strong hidden in its emerald dress.</member>
                       <member>Wordless but near she watched, no turn to lose</member>
                       <member>Of the bright face and body which she loved.</member>
                       <member>Her life was now in seconds, not in hours,</member>
                       <member>And every moment she economised</member>
                       <member>Like a pale merchant leaned above his store,</member>
                       <member>The miser of his poor remaining gold.</member>
                       <member>But Satyavan wielded a joyous axe.</member>
                       <member>He sang high snatches of a sage's chant</member>
                       <member>That pealed of conquered death and demons slain,</member>
                       <member>And sometimes paused to cry to her sweet speech</member>
                       <member>Of love and mockery tenderer than love:</member>
                       <member>She like a pantheress leaped upon his words</member>
                       <member>And carried them into her cavern heart.</member>
                       <member>But as he worked, his doom upon him came.</member>
                       <member>The violent and hungry hounds of pain</member>
                       <member>Travelled through his body biting as they passed</member>
                       <member>Silently, and all his suffering breath besieged</member>
                       <member>Strove to rend life's strong heart-cords and be free.</member>
                       <member>Then helped, as if a beast had left its prey,</member>
                       <member>A moment in a wave of rich relief</member>
                       <member>Reborn to strength and happy ease he stood</member>
                       <member>Rejoicing and resumed his confident toil</member>
                       <member>But with less seeing strokes. Now the great woodsman</member>
                       <member>Hewed at him and his labour ceased: lifting</member>
                       <member>His arm he flung away the poignant axe</member>
                       <member>Far from him like an instrument of pain.</member>
                       <member>She came to him in silent anguish and clasped,</member>
                       <member>And he cried to her, "Savitri, a pang</member>
                       <member>Cleaves through my head and breast as if the axe</member>
                       <member>Were piercing it and not the living branch.</member>
                       <member>Such agony rends me as the tree must feel</member>
                       <member>When it is sundered and must lose its life.</member>
                       <member>Awhile let me lay my head upon thy lap</member>
                       <member>And guard me with thy hands from evil fate:</member>
                       <member>Perhaps because thou touchest, death may pass."</member>
                       <member>Then Savitri sat under branches wide,</member>
                       <member>Cool, green against the sun, not the hurt tree</member>
                       <member>Which his keen axe had cloven,—that she shunned;</member>
                       <member>But leaned beneath a fortunate kingly trunk</member>
                       <member>She guarded him in her bosom and strove to soothe</member>
                       <member>His anguished brow and body with her hands.</member>
                       <member>All grief and fear were dead within her now</member>
                       <member>And a great calm had fallen. The wish to lessen</member>
                       <member>His suffering, the impulse that opposes pain</member>
                       <member>Were the one mortal feeling left. It passed:</member>
                       <member>Griefless and strong she waited like the gods.</member>
                       <member>But now his sweet familiar hue was changed</member>
                       <member>Into a tarnished greyness and his eyes</member>
                       <member>Dimmed over, forsaken of the clear light she loved.</member>
                       <member>Only the dull and physical mind was left,</member>
                       <member>Vacant of the bright spirit's luminous gaze.</member>
                       <member>But once before it faded wholly back,</member>
                       <member>He cried out in a clinging last despair,</member>
                       <member>"Savitri, Savitri, O Savitri,</member>
                       <member>Lean down, my soul, and kiss me while I die."</member>
                       <member>And even as her pallid lips pressed his,</member>
                       <member>His failed, losing last sweetness of response;</member>
                       <member>His cheek pressed down her golden arm. She sought</member>
                       <member>His mouth still with her living mouth, as if</member>
                       <member>She could persuade his soul back with her kiss;</member>
                       <member>Then grew aware they were no more alone.</member>
                       <member>Something had come there conscious, vast and dire.</member>
                       <member>Near her she felt a silent shade immense</member>
                       <member>Chilling the noon with darkness for its back.</member>
                       <member>An awful hush had fallen upon the place:</member>
                       <member>There was no cry of birds, no voice of beasts.</member>
                       <member>A terror and an anguish filled the world,</member>
                       <member>As if annihilation's mystery</member>
                       <member>Had taken a sensible form. A cosmic mind</member>
                       <member>Looked out on all from formidable eyes</member>
                       <member>Contemning all with its unbearable gaze</member>
                       <member>And with immortal lids and a vast brow</member>
                       <member>It saw in its immense destroying thought</member>
                       <member>All things and beings as a pitiful dream,</member>
                       <member>Rejecting with calm disdain Nature's delight,</member>
                       <member>The wordless meaning of its deep regard</member>
                       <member>Voicing the unreality of things</member>
                       <member>And life that would be for ever but never was</member>
                       <member>And its brief and vain recurrence without cease,</member>
                       <member>As if from a Silence without form or name</member>
                       <member>The Shadow of a remote uncaring god</member>
                       <member>Doomed to his Nought the illusory universe,</member>
                       <member>Cancelling its show of idea and act in Time</member>
                       <member>And its imitation of eternity.</member>
                       <member>She knew that visible Death was standing there</member>
                       <member>And Satyavan had passed from her embrace.</member>

                      <member>So was she left alone in the huge wood,</member>
                       <member>Surrounded by a dim unthinking world,</member>
                       <member>Her husband's corpse on her forsaken breast.</member>
                       <member>In her vast silent spirit motionless</member>
                       <member>She measured not her loss with helpless thoughts,</member>
                       <member>Nor rent with tears the marble seals of pain:</member>
                       <member>She rose not yet to face the dreadful god.</member>

                       <member>In a great stillness without stir or voice,</member>
                       <member>As if her mind had died with Satyavan.</member>
                       <member>But still the human heart in her beat on.</member>

                       <member>Which in tremendous moments of our lives</member>
                       <member>Can overtake sometimes the human soul</member>
                       <member>And hold it up towards its luminous source.</member>
                       <member>The veil is torn, the thinker is no more:</member>
                       <member>Only the spirit sees and all is known.</member>
                       <member>Then a calm Power seated above our brows</member>

                       <member>Untouched and tranquil amid error and tears</member>
                       <member>And measureless above our striving wills,</member>

                       <member>To mate with the Glory it sees, the spirit grows:</member>

                       <member>This in a moment's depths was born in her.</member>
                       <member>Now to the limitless gaze disclosed that sees</member>

                       <member>A Presence was there that filled the listening world;</member>
                       <member>A central All assumed her boundless life.</member>
                       <member>A sovereignty, a silence and a swiftness,</member>
                       <member>One brooded over abysses who was she.</member>

                       <member>A halo of Wisdom's lightnings for its crown,</member>

                       <member>The two opposed each other with their eyes,</member>
                       <member>Woman and universal god: around her,</member>
                       <member>Piling their void unbearable loneliness</member>
                       <member>Upon her mighty uncompanioned soul,</member>
                       <member>Many inhuman solitudes came close.</member>
                       <member>Vacant eternities forbidding hope</member>
                       <member>Laid upon her their huge and lifeless look,</member>
                       <member>And to her ears, silencing earthly sounds,</member>
                       <member>A sad and formidable voice arose</member>
                       <member>Which seemed the whole adverse world's. "Unclasp", it cried,</member>
                       <member>"Thy passionate influence and relax, O slave</member>
                       <member>Of Nature, changing tool of changeless Law,</member>
                       <member>Who vainly writh'st rebellion to my yoke,</member>

                       <member>Entomb thy passion in its living grave.</member>
                       <member>Leave now the once-loved spirit's abandoned robe:</member>

                       <member>It ceased, she moved not, and it spoke again,</member>
                       <member>Lowering its mighty key to human chords,—</member>
                       <member>Yet a dread cry behind the uttered sounds,</member>
                       <member>Echoing all sadness and immortal scorn,</member>
                       <member>Moaned like a hunger of far wandering waves.</member>

                       <member>Drew back her heart's force that clasped his body still</member>
                       <member>Where from her lap renounced on the smooth grass</member>
                       <member>Softly it lay, as often before in sleep</member>
                       <member>When from their couch she rose in the white dawn</member>
                       <member>Called by her daily tasks: now too, as if called,</member>
                       <member>She rose and stood gathered in lonely strength,</member>
                       <member>Like one who drops his mantle for a race</member>
                       <member>And waits the signal, motionlessly swift.</member>
                       <member>She knew not to what course: her spirit above</member>
                       <member>On the crypt-summit of her secret form</member>
                       <member>Like one left sentinel on a mountain crest,</member>
                       <member>A fiery-footed splendour puissant-winged,</member>
                       <member>Watched flaming-silent, with her voiceless soul</member>
                       <member>Like a still sail upon a windless sea.</member>
                       <member>White passionless it rode, an anchored might,</member>
                       <member>Waiting what far-ridged impulse should arise</member>
                       <member>Out of the eternal depths and cast its surge.</member>
                       <member>Then Death the king leaned boundless down, as leans</member>
                       <member>Night over tired lands, when evening pales</member>
                       <member>And fading gleams break down the horizon's walls,</member>
                       <member>Nor yet the dusk grows mystic with the moon.</member>
                       <member>The dim and awful godhead rose erect</member>
                       <member>From his brief stooping to his touch on earth,</member>
                       <member>And, like a dream that wakes out of a dream,</member>
                       <member>Forsaking the poor mould of that dead clay,</member>
                       <member>Another luminous Satyavan arose,</member>
                       <member>Starting upright from the recumbent earth</member>
                       <member>As if someone over viewless borders stepped</member>
                       <member>Emerging on the edge of unseen worlds.</member>
                       <member>In the earth's day the silent marvel stood</member>
                       <member>Between the mortal woman and the god.</member>
                       <member>Such seemed he as if one departed came</member>
                       <member>Wearing the light of a celestial shape</member>
                       <member>Splendidly alien to the mortal air.</member>
                       <member>The mind sought things long loved and fell back foiled</member>
                       <member>From unfamiliar hues, beheld yet longed,</member>
                       <member>By the sweet radiant form unsatisfied,</member>
                       <member>Incredulous of its too bright hints of heaven;</member>
                       <member>Too strange the brilliant phantasm to life's clasp</member>
                       <member>Desiring the warm creations of the earth</member>
                       <member>Reared in the ardour of material suns,</member>
                       <member>The senses seized in vain a glorious shade:</member>
                       <member>Only the spirit knew the spirit still,</member>
                       <member>And the heart divined the old loved heart, though changed.</member>
                       <member>Between two realms he stood, not wavering,</member>
                       <member>But fixed in quiet strong expectancy,</member>
                       <member>Like one who, sightless, listens for a command.</member>
                       <member>So were they immobile on that earthly field,</member>
                       <member>Powers not of earth, though one in human clay.</member>
                       <member>On either side of one two spirits strove;</member>
                       <member>Silence battled with silence, vast with vast.</member>
                       <member>But now the impulse of the Path was felt</member>
                       <member>Moving from the Silence that supports the stars</member>
                       <member>To touch the confines of the visible world.</member>
                       <member>Luminous he moved away; behind him Death</member>
                       <member>Went slowly with his noiseless tread, as seen</member>
                       <member>In dream-built fields a shadowy herdsman glides</member>
                       <member>Behind some wanderer from his voiceless herds,</member>
                       <member>And Savitri moved behind eternal Death,</member>
                       <member>Her mortal pace was equalled with the god's.</member>
                       <member>Wordless she travelled in her lover's steps,</member>
                       <member>Planting her human feet where his had trod,</member>
                       <member>Into the perilous silences beyond.</member>

                       <member>Journeying as if upon an unseen road.</member>
                       <member>Around her on the green and imaged earth</member>
                       <member>The flickering screen of forests ringed her steps;</member>
                       <member>Its thick luxurious obstacle of boughs</member>
                       <member>Besieged her body pressing dimly through</member>
                       <member>In a rich realm of whispers palpable,</member>

                       <member>Rippled around her like an emerald robe.</member>
                       <member>But more and more this grew an alien sound,</member>
                       <member>And her old intimate body seemed to her</member>
                       <member>A burden which her being remotely bore.</member>
                       <member>Herself lived far in some uplifted scene</member>

                       <member>The luminous spirit glided stilly on</member>
                       <member>And the great shadow travelled vague behind.</member>
                       <member>Still with an amorous crowd of seeking hands</member>
                       <member>Softly entreated by their old desires</member>
                       <member>Her senses felt earth's close and gentle air</member>
                       <member>Cling round them and in troubled branches knew</member>
                       <member>Uncertain treadings of a faint-foot wind:</member>
                       <member>She bore dim fragrances, far callings touched;</member>
                       <member>The wild bird's voice and its winged rustle came</member>
                       <member>As if a sigh from some forgotten world.</member>
                       <member>Earth stood aloof, yet near: round her it wove</member>
                       <member>Its sweetness and its greenness and delight,</member>
                       <member>Its brilliance suave of well-loved vivid hues,</member>
                       <member>Sunlight arriving to its golden noon,</member>
                       <member>And the blue heavens and the caressing soil.</member>
                       <member>The ancient mother offered to her child</member>
                       <member>Her simple world of kind familiar things.</member>
                       <member>But now, as if the body's sensuous hold</member>
                       <member>Curbing the godhead of her infinite walk</member>
                       <member>Had freed those spirits to their grander road</member>
                       <member>Across some boundary's intangible bar,</member>
                       <member>The silent god grew mighty and remote</member>
                       <member>In other spaces, and the soul she loved</member>
                       <member>Lost its consenting nearness to her life.</member>
                       <member>Into a deep and unfamiliar air</member>
                       <member>Enormous, windless, without stir or sound</member>
                       <member>They seemed to enlarge away, drawn by some wide</member>
                       <member>Pale distance, from the warm control of earth</member>
                       <member>And her grown far: now, now they would escape.</member>
                       <member>Then flaming from her body's nest alarmed</member>
                       <member>Her violent spirit soared at Satyavan.</member>
                       <member>Out mid the plunge of heaven-surrounded rocks</member>
                       <member>So in a terror and a wrath divine</member>
                       <member>From her eyrie streams against the ascending death,</member>
                       <member>Indignant at its crouching point of steel,</member>
                       <member>A fierce she-eagle threatened in her brood,</member>
                       <member>Borne on a rush of puissance and a cry,</member>
                       <member>Outwinging like a mass of golden fire.</member>
                       <member>So on a spirit's flaming outrush borne</member>
                       <member>She crossed the borders of dividing sense;</member>
                       <member>Like pale discarded sheaths dropped dully down</member>
                       <member>Her mortal members fell back from her soul.</member>
                       <member>A moment of a secret body's sleep,</member>
                       <member>Her trance knew not of sun or earth or world;</member>
                       <member>Thought, time and death were absent from her grasp:</member>
                       <member>She knew not self, forgotten was Savitri.</member>
                       <member>All was the violent ocean of a will</member>
                       <member>Where lived captive to an immense caress,</member>
                       <member>Possessed in a supreme identity,</member>
                       <member>Her aim, joy, origin, Satyavan alone.</member>
                       <member>Her sovereign prisoned in her being's core,</member>
                       <member>He beat there like a rhythmic heart,—herself</member>
                       <member>But different still, one loved, enveloped, clasped,</member>
                       <member>A treasure saved from the collapse of space.</member>
                       <member>Around him nameless, infinite she surged,</member>
                       <member>Her spirit fulfilled in his spirit, rich with all Time,</member>
                       <member>As if Love's deathless moment had been found,</member>
                       <member>A pearl within eternity's white shell.</member>
                       <member>Then out of the engulfing sea of trance</member>
                       <member>Her mind rose drenched to light streaming with hues</member>
                       <member>Of vision and, awake once more to Time,</member>
                       <member>Returned to shape the lineaments of things</member>
                       <member>And live in borders of the seen and known.</member>
                       <member>Onward the three still moved in her soul-scene.</member>
                       <member>As if pacing through fragments of a dream,</member>
                       <member>She seemed to travel on, a visioned shape</member>
                       <member>Imagining other musers like herself,</member>
                       <member>By them imagined in their lonely sleep.</member>
                       <member>Ungrasped, unreal, yet familiar, old,</member>
                       <member>Like clefts of unsubstantial memory,</member>
                       <member>Scenes often traversed, never lived in, fled</member>
                       <member>Past her unheeding to forgotten goals.</member>
                       <member>In voiceless regions they were travellers</member>
                       <member>Alone in a new world where souls were not,</member>
                       <member>But only living moods: a strange hushed weird</member>
                       <member>Country was round them, strange far skies above,</member>
                       <member>A doubting space where dreaming objects lived</member>
                       <member>Within themselves their one unchanged idea.</member>
                       <member>Weird were the grasses, weird the treeless plains;</member>
                       <member>Weird ran the road which like fear hastening</member>
                       <member>Towards that of which it has most terror, passed</member>
                       <member>Phantasmal between pillared conscious rocks</member>
                       <member>Sombre and high, gates brooding, whose stone thoughts</member>
                       <member>Lost their huge sense beyond in giant night.</member>
                       <member>Enigma of the Inconscient's sculptural sleep,</member>
                       <member>Symbols of the approach to darkness old</member>
                       <member>And monuments of her titanic reign,</member>
                       <member>Opening to depths like dumb appalling jaws</member>
                       <member>That wait a traveller down a haunted path</member>
                       <member>Attracted to a mystery that slays,</member>
                       <member>They watched across her road, cruel and still;</member>
                       <member>Sentinels they stood of dumb Necessity,</member>
                       <member>Mute heads of vigilant and sullen gloom,</member>
                       <member>Carved muzzle of a dim enormous world.</member>
                       <member>Then, to that chill sere heavy line arrived</member>
                       <member>Where his feet touched the shadowy marches' brink,</member>
                       <member>Turning arrested luminous Satyavan</member>
                       <member>Looked back with his wonderful eyes at Savitri.</member>

                       <member>"O mortal, turn back to thy transient kind;</member>

                       <member>As if thy breath could live where Time must die.</member>
                       <member>Think not thy mind-born passion strength from heaven</member>
                       <member>To uplift thy spirit from its earthly base</member>
                       <member>And, breaking out from the material cage,</member>
                       <member>To upbuoy thy feet of dream in groundless Nought</member>
                       <member>And bear thee through the pathless infinite.</member>
                       <member>Only in human limits man lives safe.</member>
                       <member>Trust not in the unreal Lords of Time,</member>
                       <member>Immortal deeming this image of thyself</member>
                       <member>Which they have built on a Dream's floating ground.</member>
                       <member>Let not the dreadful goddess move thy soul</member>
                       <member>To enlarge thy vehement trespass into worlds</member>
                       <member>Where it shall perish like a helpless thought.</member>
                       <member>Know the cold term-stones of thy hopes in life.</member>
                       <member>Armed vainly with the Ideal's borrowed might,</member>
                       <member>Dare not to outstep man's bound and measured force:</member>
                       <member>Ignorant and stumbling, in brief boundaries pent,</member>
                       <member>He crowns himself the world's mock suzerain,</member>
                       <member>Tormenting Nature with the works of Mind.</member>
                       <member>O sleeper, dreaming of divinity,</member>
                       <member>Wake trembling mid the indifferent silences</member>
                       <member>In which thy few weak chords of being die.</member>
                       <member>Impermanent creatures, sorrowful foam of Time,</member>
                       <member>Your transient loves bind not the eternal gods."</member>
                       <member>The dread voice ebbed in the consenting hush</member>
                       <member>Which seemed to close upon it, wide, intense,</member>
                       <member>A wordless sanction from the jaws of Night.</member>
                       <member>The Woman answered not. Her high nude soul,</member>
                       <member>Stripped of the girdle of mortality,</member>
                       <member>Against fixed destiny and the grooves of law</member>
                       <member>Stood up in its sheer will a primal force.</member>
                       <member>Still like a statue on its pedestal,</member>

                       <member>All stood as if a world were doomed to die</member>
                       <member>And waited on the eternal silence' brink.</member>
                       <member>Heaven leaned towards them like a cloudy brow</member>
                       <member>Of menace through the dim and voiceless hush.</member>
                       <member>As thoughts stand mute on a despairing verge</member>

                       <member>And the last dreams must end, they paused; in their front</member>
                       <member>Were glooms like shadowy wings, behind them, pale,</member>
                       <member>The lifeless evening was a dead man's gaze.</member>
                       <member>Hungry beyond, the night desired her soul.</member>
                       <member>But still in its lone niche of templed strength</member>
                       <member>Motionless, her flame-bright spirit, mute, erect,</member>
                       <member>Burned like a torch-fire from a windowed room</member>
                       <member>Pointing against the darkness' sombre breast.</member>

                       <member>Daring to journey through the eternal Night.</member>
                       <member>Armoured with light she advanced her foot to plunge</member>
                       <member>Into the dread and hueless vacancy;</member>
                       <member>Immortal, unappalled, her spirit faced</member>
                       <member>The danger of the ruthless eyeless waste.</member>
                       <member>Against night's inky ground they stirred, moulding</member>
                       <member>Mysterious motion on her human tread,</member>
                       <member>A swimming action and a drifting march</member>
                       <member>Like figures moving before eyelids closed:</member>
                       <member>All as in dreams went slipping, gliding on.</member>
                       <member>The rock-gate's heavy walls were left behind;</member>

                       <member>Present and past into the Timeless lapsed;</member>
                       <member>Arrested upon dim adventure's brink,</member>
                       <member>The future ended drowned in nothingness.</member>
                       <member>Amid collapsing shapes they wound obscure;</member>
                       <member>The fading vestibules of a tenebrous world</member>
                       <member>Received them, where they seemed to move and yet</member>
                       <member>Be still, nowhere advancing yet to pass,</member>
                       <member>A dumb procession a dim picture bounds,</member>
                       <member>Not conscious forms threading a real scene.</member>
                       <member>A mystery of terror's boundlessness,</member>
                       <member>Gathering its hungry strength the huge pitiless void</member>
                       <member>Surrounded slowly with its soundless depths,</member>
                       <member>And monstrous, cavernous, a shapeless throat</member>
                       <member>Devoured her into its shadowy strangling mass,</member>
                       <member>The fierce spiritual agony of a dream.</member>
                       <member>A curtain of impenetrable dread,</member>
                       <member>The darkness hung around her cage of sense</member>
                       <member>As, when the trees have turned to blotted shades</member>
                       <member>And the last friendly glimmer fades away,</member>
                       <member>Around a bullock in the forest tied</member>
                       <member>By hunters closes in no empty night.</member>
                       <member>The thought that strives in the world was here unmade;</member>
                       <member>Its effort it renounced to live and know,</member>
                       <member>Convinced at last that it had never been;</member>
                       <member>It perished, all its dream of action done:</member>
                       <member>This clotted cypher was its dark result.</member>
                       <member>In the smothering stress of this stupendous Nought</member>
                       <member>Mind could not think, breath could not breathe, the soul</member>
                       <member>Could not remember or feel itself; it seemed</member>
                       <member>A hollow gulf of sterile emptiness,</member>
                       <member>A zero oblivious of the sum it closed,</member>
                       <member>An abnegation of the Maker's joy</member>
                       <member>Saved by no wide repose, no depth of peace.</member>
                       <member>On all that claims here to be Truth and God</member>
                       <member>And conscious self and the revealing Word</member>
                       <member>And the creative rapture of the Mind</member>
                       <member>And Love and Knowledge and heart's delight, there fell</member>
                       <member>The immense refusal of the eternal No.</member>
                       <member>As disappears a golden lamp in gloom</member>
                       <member>Borne into distance from the eyes' desire,</member>
                       <member>Into the shadows vanished Savitri.</member>
                       <member>There was no course, no path, no end or goal:</member>
                       <member>Visionless she moved amid insensible gulfs,</member>
                       <member>Or drove through some great black unknowing waste,</member>
                       <member>Or whirled in a dumb eddy of meeting winds</member>
                       <member>Assembled by the titan hands of Chance.</member>
                       <member>There was none with her in the dreadful Vast:</member>
                       <member>She saw no more the vague tremendous god,</member>
                       <member>Her eyes had lost their luminous Satyavan.</member>
                       <member>Yet not for this her spirit failed, but held</member>
                       <member>More deeply than the bounded senses can</member>
                       <member>Which grasp externally and find to lose,</member>
                       <member>Its object loved. So when on earth they lived</member>
                       <member>She had felt him straying through the glades, the glades</member>
                       <member>A scene in her, its clefts her being's vistas</member>
                       <member>Opening their secrets to his search and joy,</member>
                       <member>Because to jealous sweetness in her heart</member>
                       <member>Whatever happy space his cherished feet</member>
                       <member>Preferred, must be at once her soul embracing</member>
                       <member>His body, passioning dumbly to his tread.</member>
                       <member>But now a silent gulf between them came</member>
                       <member>And to abysmal loneliness she fell,</member>
                       <member>Even from herself cast out, from love remote.</member>
                       <member>Long hours, since long it seems when sluggish time</member>
                       <member>Is measured by the throbs of the soul's pain,</member>
                       <member>In an unreal darkness empty and drear</member>
                       <member>She travelled treading on the corpse of life,</member>
                       <member>Lost in a blindness of extinguished souls.</member>
                       <member>Solitary in the anguish of the void</member>
                       <member>She lived in spite of death, she conquered still;</member>
                       <member>In vain her puissant being was oppressed:</member>
                       <member>Her heavy long monotony of pain</member>
                       <member>Tardily of its fierce self-torture tired.</member>
                       <member>At first a faint inextinguishable gleam,</member>
                       <member>Pale but immortal, flickered in the gloom</member>
                       <member>As if a memory came to spirits dead,</member>
                       <member>A memory that wished to live again,</member>
                       <member>Dissolved from mind in Nature's natal sleep.</member>
                       <member>It wandered like a lost ray of the moon</member>
                       <member>Revealing to the night her soul of dread;</member>
                       <member>Serpentine in the gleam the darkness lolled,</member>
                       <member>Its black hoods jewelled with the mystic glow;</member>
                       <member>Its dull sleek folds shrank back and coiled and slid,</member>
                       <member>As though they felt all light a cruel pain</member>
                       <member>And suffered from the pale approach of hope.</member>
                       <member>Night felt assailed her heavy sombre reign;</member>
                       <member>The splendour of some bright eternity</member>
                       <member>Threatened with this faint beam of wandering Truth</member>
                       <member>Her empire of the everlasting Nought.</member>
                       <member>Implacable in her intolerant strength</member>
                       <member>And confident that she alone was true,</member>
                       <member>She strove to stifle the frail dangerous ray;</member>
                       <member>Aware of an all-negating immensity</member>
                       <member>She reared her giant head of Nothingness,</member>
                       <member>Her mouth of darkness swallowing all that is;</member>
                       <member>She saw in herself the tenebrous Absolute.</member>
                       <member>But still the light prevailed and still it grew,</member>
                       <member>And Savitri to her lost self awoke;</member>
                       <member>Her limbs refused the cold embrace of death,</member>
                       <member>Her heart-beats triumphed in the grasp of pain;</member>
                       <member>Her soul persisted claiming for its joy</member>
                       <member>The soul of the beloved now seen no more.</member>
                       <member>Before her in the stillness of the world</member>
                       <member>Once more she heard the treading of a god,</member>
                       <member>And out of the dumb darkness Satyavan,</member>
                       <member>Her husband, grew into a luminous shade.</member>
                       <member>Then a sound pealed through that dead monstrous realm:</member>
                       <member>Vast like the surge in a tired swimmer's ears,</member>
                       <member>Clamouring, a fatal iron-hearted roar,</member>
                       <member>Death missioned to the night his lethal call.</member>
                       <member>"This is my silent dark immensity,</member>
                       <member>This is the home of everlasting Night,</member>
                       <member>This is the secrecy of Nothingness</member>
                       <member>Entombing the vanity of life's desires.</member>
                       <member>Hast thou beheld thy source, O transient heart,</member>
                       <member>And known from what the dream thou art was made?</member>
                       <member>In this stark sincerity of nude emptiness</member>
                       <member>Hopest thou still always to last and love?"</member>
                       <member>The Woman answered not. Her spirit refused</member>
                       <member>The voice of Night that knew and Death that thought.</member>
                       <member>In her beginningless infinity</member>
                       <member>Through her soul's reaches unconfined she gazed;</member>
                       <member>She saw the undying fountains of her life,</member>
                       <member>She knew herself eternal without birth.</member>
                       <member>But still opposing her with endless night</member>
                       <member>Death, the dire god, inflicted on her eyes</member>
                       <member>The immortal calm of his tremendous gaze:</member>
                       <member>"Although thou hast survived the unborn void</member>
                       <member>Which never shall forgive, while Time endures,</member>
                       <member>The primal violence that fashioned thought,</member>
                       <member>Forcing the immobile vast to suffer and live,</member>
                       <member>This sorrowful victory only hast thou won</member>
                       <member>To live for a little without Satyavan.</member>
                       <member>What shall the ancient goddess give to thee</member>
                       <member>Who helps thy heart-beats? Only she prolongs</member>
                       <member>The nothing dreamed existence and delays</member>
                       <member>With the labour of living thy eternal sleep.</member>
                       <member>A fragile miracle of thinking clay,</member>
                       <member>Armed with illusions walks the child of Time.</member>
                       <member>To fill the void around he feels and dreads,</member>
                       <member>The void he came from and to which he goes,</member>
                       <member>He magnifies his self and names it God.</member>
                       <member>He calls the heavens to help his suffering hopes.</member>
                       <member>He sees above him with a longing heart</member>
                       <member>Bare spaces more unconscious than himself</member>
                       <member>That have not even his privilege of mind,</member>
                       <member>And empty of all but their unreal blue,</member>
                       <member>And peoples them with bright and merciful powers.</member>
                       <member>For the sea roars around him and earth quakes</member>
                       <member>Beneath his steps, and fire is at his doors,</member>
                       <member>And death prowls baying through the woods of life.</member>
                       <member>Moved by the Presences with which he yearns,</member>
                       <member>He offers in implacable shrines his soul</member>
                       <member>And clothes all with the beauty of his dreams.</member>
                       <member>The gods who watch the earth with sleepless eyes</member>
                       <member>And guide its giant stumblings through the void,</member>
                       <member>Have given to man the burden of his mind;</member>
                       <member>In his unwilling heart they have lit their fires</member>
                       <member>And sown in it incurable unrest.</member>
                       <member>His mind is a hunter upon tracks unknown;</member>
                       <member>Amusing Time with vain discovery,</member>
                       <member>He deepens with thought the mystery of his fate</member>
                       <member>And turns to song his laughter and his tears.</member>
                       <member>His mortality vexing with the immortal's dreams,</member>
                       <member>Troubling his transience with the infinite's breath,</member>
                       <member>They gave him hungers which no food can fill;</member>
                       <member>He is the cattle of the shepherd gods.</member>
                       <member>His body the tether with which he is tied,</member>
                       <member>They cast for fodder grief and hope and joy:</member>
                       <member>His pasture ground they have fenced with Ignorance.</member>
                       <member>Into his fragile undefended breast</member>
                       <member>They have breathed a courage that is met by death,</member>
                       <member>They have given a wisdom that is mocked by night,</member>
                       <member>They have traced a journey that foresees no goal.</member>
                       <member>Aimless man toils in an uncertain world,</member>
                       <member>Lulled by inconstant pauses of his pain,</member>

                       <member>Bound to the chariot of the dreadful gods.</member>
                       <member>But if thou still canst hope and still wouldst love,</member>
                       <member>Return to thy body's shell, thy tie to earth,</member>
                       <member>And with thy heart's little remnants try to live.</member>
                       <member>Hope not to win back to thee Satyavan.</member>
                       <member>Yet since thy strength deserves no trivial crown,</member>
                       <member>Gifts I can give to soothe thy wounded life.</member>
                       <member>The pacts which transient beings make with fate,</member>
                       <member>And the wayside sweetness earth-bound hearts would pluck,</member>
                       <member>These if thy will accepts make freely thine.</member>
                       <member>Choose a life's hopes for thy deceiving prize."</member>
                       <member>As ceased the ruthless and tremendous Voice,</member>
                       <member>Unendingly there rose in Savitri,</member>
                       <member>Like moonlit ridges on a shuddering flood,</member>
                       <member>A stir of thoughts out of some silence born</member>
                       <member>Across the sea of her dumb fathomless heart.</member>
                       <member>At last she spoke; her voice was heard by Night:</member>
                       <member>"I bow not to thee, O huge mask of death,</member>
                       <member>Black lie of night to the cowed soul of man,</member>
                       <member>Unreal, inescapable end of things,</member>
                       <member>Thou grim jest played with the immortal spirit.</member>
                       <member>Conscious of immortality I walk.</member>
                       <member>A victor spirit conscious of my force,</member>
                       <member>Not as a suppliant to thy gates I came:</member>
                       <member>Unslain I have survived the clutch of Night.</member>
                       <member>My first strong grief moves not my seated mind;</member>
                       <member>My unwept tears have turned to pearls of strength:</member>
                       <member>I have transformed my ill-shaped brittle clay</member>
                       <member>Into the hardness of a statued soul.</member>
                       <member>Now in the wrestling of the splendid gods</member>
                       <member>My spirit shall be obstinate and strong</member>
                       <member>Against the vast refusal of the world.</member>
                       <member>I stoop not with the subject mob of minds</member>
                       <member>Who run to glean with eager satisfied hands</member>
                       <member>And pick from its mire mid many trampling feet</member>
                       <member>Its scornful small concessions to the weak.</member>
                       <member>Mine is the labour of the battling gods:</member>
                       <member>Imposing on the slow reluctant years</member>
                       <member>The flaming will that reigns beyond the stars,</member>
                       <member>They lay the law of Mind on Matter's works</member>
                       <member>And win the soul's wish from earth's inconscient Force.</member>
                       <member>First I demand whatever Satyavan,</member>
                       <member>My husband, waking in the forest's charm</member>
                       <member>Out of his long pure childhood's lonely dreams,</member>
                       <member>Desired and had not for his beautiful life.</member>
                       <member>Give, if thou must, or, if thou canst, refuse."</member>
                       <member>Death bowed his head in scornful cold assent,</member>
                       <member>The builder of this dreamlike earth for man</member>
                       <member>Who has mocked with vanity all gifts he gave.</member>
                       <member>Uplifting his disastrous voice he spoke:</member>
                       <member>"Indulgent to the dreams my touch shall break,</member>
                       <member>I yield to his blind father's longing heart</member>
                       <member>Kingdom and power and friends and greatness lost</member>
                       <member>And royal trappings for his peaceful age,</member>
                       <member>The pallid pomps of man's declining days,</member>
                       <member>The silvered decadent glories of life's fall.</member>
                       <member>To one who wiser grew by adverse Fate,</member>
                       <member>Goods I restore the deluded soul prefers</member>
                       <member>To impersonal nothingness's bare sublime.</member>
                       <member>The sensuous solace of the light I give</member>
                       <member>To eyes which could have found a larger realm,</member>
                       <member>A deeper vision in their fathomless night.</member>
                       <member>For that this man desired and asked in vain</member>
                       <member>While still he lived on earth and cherished hope.</member>
                       <member>Back from the grandeur of my perilous realms</member>
                       <member>Go, mortal, to thy small permitted sphere!</member>
                       <member>Hasten swift-footed, lest to slay thy life</member>
                       <member>The great laws thou hast violated, moved,</member>
                       <member>Open at last on thee their marble eyes."</member>
                       <member>But Savitri answered the disdainful Shade:</member>
                       <member>"World-spirit, I was thy equal spirit born.</member>
                       <member>My will too is a law, my strength a god.</member>
                       <member>I am immortal in my mortality.</member>
                       <member>I tremble not before the immobile gaze</member>
                       <member>Of the unchanging marble hierarchies</member>
                       <member>That look with the stone eyes of Law and Fate.</member>
                       <member>My soul can meet them with its living fire.</member>
                       <member>Out of thy shadow give me back again</member>
                       <member>Into earth's flowering spaces Satyavan</member>
                       <member>In the sweet transiency of human limbs</member>
                       <member>To do with him my spirit's burning will.</member>
                       <member>I will bear with him the ancient Mother's load,</member>
                       <member>I will follow with him earth's path that leads to God.</member>
                       <member>Else shall the eternal spaces open to me,</member>
                       <member>While round us strange horizons far recede,</member>
                       <member>Travelling together the immense unknown.</member>
                       <member>For I who have trod with him the tracts of Time,</member>
                       <member>Can meet behind his steps whatever night</member>
                       <member>Or unimaginable stupendous dawn</member>
                       <member>Breaks on our spirits in the untrod Beyond.</member>
                       <member>Wherever thou leadst his soul I shall pursue."</member>
                       <member>But to her claim opposed, implacable,</member>
                       <member>Insisting on the immutable Decree,</member>
                       <member>Insisting on the immitigable Law</member>
                       <member>And the insignificance of created things,</member>
                       <member>Out of the rolling wastes of night there came</member>
                       <member>Born from the enigma of the unknowable depths</member>
                       <member>A voice of majesty and appalling scorn.</member>
                       <member>As when the storm-haired Titan-striding sea</member>
                       <member>Throws on a swimmer its tremendous laugh</member>
                       <member>Remembering all the joy its waves have drowned,</member>
                       <member>So from the darkness of the sovereign night</member>
                       <member>Against the Woman's boundless heart arose</member>
                       <member>The almighty cry of universal Death.</member>
                       <member>"Hast thou god-wings or feet that tread my stars,</member>
                       <member>Frail creature with the courage that aspires,</member>
                       <member>Forgetting thy bounds of thought, thy mortal role?</member>
                       <member>Their orbs were coiled before thy soul was formed.</member>
                       <member>I, Death, created them out of my void;</member>
                       <member>All things I have built in them and I destroy.</member>
                       <member>I made the worlds my net, each joy a mesh.</member>
                       <member>A Hunger amorous of its suffering prey,</member>
                       <member>Life that devours, my image see in things.</member>
                       <member>Mortal, whose spirit is my wandering breath,</member>
                       <member>Whose transience was imagined by my smile,</member>
                       <member>Flee clutching thy poor gains to thy trembling breast</member>
                       <member>Pierced by my pangs Time shall not soon appease.</member>
                       <member>Blind slave of my deaf force whom I compel</member>
                       <member>To sin that I may punish, to desire</member>
                       <member>That I may scourge thee with despair and grief</member>
                       <member>And thou come bleeding to me at the last,</member>
                       <member>Thy nothingness recognised, my greatness known,</member>
                       <member>Turn nor attempt forbidden happy fields</member>
                       <member>Meant for the souls that can obey my law,</member>
                       <member>Lest in their sombre shrines thy tread awake</member>
                       <member>From their uneasy iron-hearted sleep</member>
                       <member>The Furies who avenge fulfilled desire.</member>
                       <member>Dread lest in skies where passion hoped to live,</member>
                       <member>The Unknown's lightnings start and, terrified,</member>
                       <member>Lone, sobbing, hunted by the hounds of heaven,</member>
                       <member>A wounded and forsaken soul thou flee</member>
                       <member>Through the long torture of the centuries,</member>
                       <member>Nor many lives exhaust the tireless Wrath</member>
                       <member>Hell cannot slake nor Heaven's mercy assuage.</member>
                       <member>I will take from thee the black eternal grip:</member>
                       <member>Clasping in thy heart thy fate's exiguous dole</member>
                       <member>Depart in peace, if peace for man is just."</member>
                       <member>But Savitri answered meeting scorn with scorn,</member>
                       <member>The mortal woman to the dreadful Lord:</member>
                       <member>"Who is this God imagined by thy night,</member>
                       <member>Contemptuously creating worlds disdained,</member>
                       <member>Who made for vanity the brilliant stars?</member>
                       <member>Not he who has reared his temple in my thoughts</member>
                       <member>And made his sacred floor my human heart.</member>
                       <member>My God is will and triumphs in his paths,</member>
                       <member>My God is love and sweetly suffers all.</member>
                       <member>To him I have offered hope for sacrifice</member>
                       <member>And gave my longings as a sacrament.</member>
                       <member>Who shall prohibit or hedge in his course,</member>
                       <member>The wonderful, the charioteer, the swift?</member>
                       <member>A traveller of the million roads of life,</member>
                       <member>His steps familiar with the lights of heaven</member>
                       <member>Tread without pain the sword-paved courts of hell;</member>
                       <member>There he descends to edge eternal joy.</member>
                       <member>Love's golden wings have power to fan thy void:</member>
                       <member>The eyes of love gaze starlike through death's night,</member>

                       <member>He labours in the depths, exults on the heights;</member>
                       <member>He shall remake thy universe, O Death."</member>
                       <member>She spoke and for a while no voice replied,</member>
                       <member>While still they travelled through the trackless night</member>
                       <member>And still that gleam was like a pallid eye</member>
                       <member>Troubling the darkness with its doubtful gaze.</member>
                       <member>Then once more came a deep and perilous pause</member>

                       <member>Once more a Thought, a Word in the void arose</member>
                       <member>And Death made answer to the human soul:</member>

                       <member>This is thy body's sweetest lure of bliss,</member>
                       <member>Assailed by pain, a frail precarious form,</member>

                       <member>With honey of physical longings and the heart's fire</member>
                       <member>And, a vain oneness seeking, to embrace</member>
                       <member>The brilliant idol of a fugitive hour.</member>
                       <member>And thou, what art thou, soul, thou glorious dream</member>
                       <member>Of brief emotions made and glittering thoughts,</member>
                       <member>A thin dance of fireflies speeding through the night,</member>
                       <member>A sparkling ferment in life's sunlit mire?</member>
                       <member>Wilt thou claim immortality, O heart,</member>
                       <member>Crying against the eternal witnesses</member>
                       <member>That thou and he are endless powers and last?</member>
                       <member>Death only lasts and the inconscient Void.</member>
                       <member>I only am eternal and endure.</member>
                       <member>I am the shapeless formidable Vast,</member>
                       <member>I am the emptiness that men call Space,</member>
                       <member>I am a timeless Nothingness carrying all,</member>
                       <member>I am the Illimitable, the mute Alone.</member>
                       <member>I, Death, am He; there is no other God.</member>
                       <member>All from my depths are born, they live by death;</member>
                       <member>All to my depths return and are no more.</member>
                       <member>I have made a world by my inconscient Force.</member>
                       <member>My Force is Nature that creates and slays</member>
                       <member>The hearts that hope, the limbs that long to live.</member>
                       <member>I have made man her instrument and slave,</member>
                       <member>His body I made my banquet, his life my food.</member>
                       <member>Man has no other help but only Death;</member>
                       <member>He comes to me at his end for rest and peace.</member>
                       <member>I, Death, am the one refuge of thy soul.</member>
                       <member>The Gods to whom man prays can help not man;</member>
                       <member>They are my imaginations and my moods</member>
                       <member>Reflected in him by illusion's power.</member>
                       <member>That which thou seest as thy immortal self</member>
                       <member>Is a shadowy icon of my infinite,</member>
                       <member>Is Death in thee dreaming of eternity.</member>
                       <member>I am the Immobile in which all things move,</member>
                       <member>I am the nude Inane in which they cease:</member>
                       <member>I have no body and no tongue to speak,</member>
                       <member>I commune not with human eye and ear;</member>
                       <member>Only thy thought gave a figure to my void.</member>
                       <member>Because, O aspirant to divinity,</member>
                       <member>Thou calledst me to wrestle with thy soul,</member>
                       <member>I have assumed a face, a form, a voice.</member>
                       <member>But if there were a Being witnessing all,</member>
                       <member>How should he help thy passionate desire?</member>
                       <member>Aloof he watches sole and absolute,</member>
                       <member>Indifferent to thy cry in nameless calm.</member>
                       <member>His being is pure, unwounded, motionless, one.</member>
                       <member>One endless watches the inconscient scene</member>
                       <member>Where all things perish, as the foam the stars.</member>
                       <member>The One lives for ever. There no Satyavan</member>
                       <member>Changing was born and there no Savitri</member>
                       <member>Claims from brief life her bribe of joy. There love</member>
                       <member>Came never with his fretful eyes of tears,</member>
                       <member>Nor Time is there nor the vain vasts of Space.</member>
                       <member>It wears no living face, it has no name,</member>
                       <member>No gaze, no heart that throbs; it asks no second</member>
                       <member>To aid its being or to share its joys.</member>
                       <member>It is delight immortally alone.</member>
                       <member>If thou desirest immortality,</member>
                       <member>Be then alone sufficient to thy soul:</member>
                       <member>Live in thyself; forget the man thou lov'st.</member>
                       <member>My last grand death shall rescue thee from life;</member>
                       <member>Then shalt thou rise into thy unmoved source."</member>
                       <member>But Savitri replied to the dread Voice:</member>
                       <member>"O Death, who reasonest, I reason not,</member>
                       <member>Reason that scans and breaks, but cannot build</member>
                       <member>Or builds in vain because she doubts her work.</member>
                       <member>I am, I love, I see, I act, I will."</member>
                       <member>Death answered her, one deep surrounding cry:</member>
                       <member>"Know also. Knowing, thou shalt cease to love</member>
                       <member>And cease to will, delivered from thy heart.</member>
                       <member>So shalt thou rest for ever and be still,</member>
                       <member>Consenting to the impermanence of things."</member>
                       <member>But Savitri replied for man to Death:</member>
                       <member>"When I have loved for ever, I shall know.</member>
                       <member>Love in me knows the truth all changings mask.</member>
                       <member>I know that knowledge is a vast embrace:</member>
                       <member>I know that every being is myself,</member>
                       <member>In every heart is hidden the myriad One.</member>
                       <member>I know the calm Transcendent bears the world,</member>
                       <member>The veiled Inhabitant, the silent Lord:</member>
                       <member>I feel his secret act, his intimate fire;</member>
                       <member>I hear the murmur of the cosmic Voice.</member>
                       <member>I know my coming was a wave from God.</member>
                       <member>For all his suns were conscient in my birth,</member>
                       <member>And one who loves in us came veiled by death.</member>
                       <member>Then was man born among the monstrous stars</member>
                       <member>Dowered with a mind and heart to conquer thee."</member>
                       <member>In the eternity of his ruthless will</member>
                       <member>Sure of his empire and his armoured might,</member>
                       <member>Like one disdaining violent helpless words</member>
                       <member>From victim lips Death answered not again.</member>
                       <member>He stood in silence and in darkness wrapped,</member>
                       <member>A figure motionless, a shadow vague,</member>
                       <member>Girt with the terrors of his secret sword.</member>
                       <member>Half-seen in clouds appeared a sombre face;</member>
                       <member>Night's dusk tiara was his matted hair,</member>
                       <member>The ashes of the pyre his forehead's sign.</member>
                       <member>Once more a wanderer in the unending Night,</member>
                       <member>Blindly forbidden by dead vacant eyes,</member>
                       <member>She travelled through the dumb unhoping vasts.</member>
                       <member>Around her rolled the shuddering waste of gloom,</member>
                       <member>Its swallowing emptiness and joyless death</member>
                       <member>Resentful of her thought and life and love.</member>
                       <member>Through the long fading night by her compelled,</member>
                       <member>Gliding half-seen on their unearthly path,</member>
                       <member>Phantasmal in the dimness moved the three.</member>

                       <member>Other is the riddle of its ambiguous face:</member>
                       <member>Death is a stair, a door, a stumbling stride</member>
                       <member>The soul must take to cross from birth to birth,</member>
                       <member>A grey defeat pregnant with victory,</member>
                       <member>A whip to lash us towards our deathless state.</member>
                       <member>The inconscient world is the spirit's self-made room,</member>

                       <member>Here in this seat of Darkness mute and lone,</member>

                       <member>Light conquered now even by that feeble beam:</member>

                       <member>Whose orb pupilled the eye of Nothingness.</member>
                       <member>A golden fire came in and burned Night's heart;</member>
                       <member>Her dusky mindlessness began to dream;</member>
                       <member>The Inconscient conscious grew, Night felt and thought.</member>

                       <member>The intolerant Darkness paled and drew apart</member>
                       <member>Till only a few black remnants stained that Ray.</member>
                       <member>But on a failing edge of dumb lost space</member>
                       <member>Still a great dragon body sullenly loomed;</member>
                       <member>Adversary of the slow struggling Dawn</member>
                       <member>Defending its ground of tortured mystery,</member>

                       <member>Melodiously with an alluring cry.</member>

                       <member>Moving suggestions on her heart-strings dwelt,</member>
                       <member>Thoughts that no habitation found, yet clung</member>
                       <member>With passionate repetition to her mind,</member>

                       <member>Disguised the Lover seeks and draws our souls.</member>
                       <member>He named himself for me, grew Satyavan.</member>
                       <member>For we were man and woman from the first,</member>
                       <member>The twin souls born from one undying fire.</member>
                       <member>Did he not dawn on me in other stars?</member>
                       <member>How has he through the thickets of the world</member>
                       <member>Pursued me like a lion in the night</member>
                       <member>And come upon me suddenly in the ways</member>
                       <member>And seized me with his glorious golden leap!</member>
                       <member>Unsatisfied he yearned for me through time,</member>
                       <member>Sometimes with wrath and sometimes with sweet peace</member>
                       <member>Desiring me since first the world began.</member>
                       <member>He rose like a wild wave out of the floods</member>
                       <member>And dragged me helpless into seas of bliss.</member>
                       <member>Out of my curtained past his arms arrive;</member>
                       <member>They have touched me like the soft persuading wind,</member>
                       <member>They have plucked me like a glad and trembling flower,</member>
                       <member>And clasped me happily burned in ruthless flame.</member>
                       <member>I too have found him charmed in lovely forms</member>
                       <member>And run delighted to his distant voice</member>
                       <member>And pressed to him past many dreadful bars.</member>
                       <member>If there is a yet happier greater god,</member>
                       <member>Let him first wear the face of Satyavan</member>
                       <member>And let his soul be one with him I love;</member>
                       <member>So let him seek me that I may desire.</member>
                       <member>For only one heart beats within my breast</member>
                       <member>And one god sits there throned. Advance, O Death,</member>
                       <member>Beyond the phantom beauty of this world;</member>
                       <member>For of its citizens I am not one.</member>
                       <member>I cherish God the Fire, not God the Dream."</member>
                       <member>But Death once more inflicted on her heart</member>
                       <member>The majesty of his calm and dreadful voice:</member>
                       <member>"A bright hallucination are thy thoughts.</member>
                       <member>A prisoner haled by a spiritual cord,</member>
                       <member>Of thy own sensuous will the ardent slave,</member>
                       <member>Thou sendest eagle-poised to meet the sun</member>
                       <member>Words winged with the red splendour of thy heart.</member>
                       <member>But knowledge dwells not in the passionate heart;</member>
                       <member>The heart's words fall back unheard from Wisdom's throne.</member>
                       <member>Vain is thy longing to build heaven on earth.</member>
                       <member>Artificer of Ideal and Idea,</member>

                       <member>But Mind, a glorious traveller in the sky,</member>
                       <member>Walks lamely on the earth with footsteps slow;</member>
                       <member>Hardly he can mould the life's rebellious stuff,</member>
                       <member>Hardly can he hold the galloping hooves of sense:</member>
                       <member>His thoughts look straight into the very heavens;</member>
                       <member>They draw their gold from a celestial mine,</member>
                       <member>His acts work painfully a common ore.</member>
                       <member>All thy high dreams were made by Matter's mind</member>
                       <member>To solace its dull work in Matter's jail,</member>
                       <member>Its only house where it alone seems true.</member>
                       <member>A solid image of reality</member>
                       <member>Carved out of being to prop the works of Time,</member>
                       <member>Matter on the firm earth sits strong and sure.</member>
                       <member>It is the first-born of created things,</member>
                       <member>It stands the last when mind and life are slain,</member>
                       <member>And if it ended all would cease to be.</member>
                       <member>All else is only its outcome or its phase:</member>
                       <member>Thy soul is a brief flower by the gardener Mind</member>
                       <member>Created in thy matter's terrain plot;</member>
                       <member>It perishes with the plant on which it grows,</member>
                       <member>For from earth's sap it draws its heavenly hue:</member>
                       <member>Thy thoughts are gleams that pass on Matter's verge,</member>
                       <member>Thy life a lapsing wave on Matter's sea.</member>
                       <member>A careful steward of Truth's limited means,</member>
                       <member>Treasuring her founded facts from the squandering Power,</member>
                       <member>It tethers mind to the tent-posts of sense,</member>
                       <member>To a leaden grey routine clamps Life's caprice</member>
                       <member>And ties all creatures with the cords of Law.</member>
                       <member>A vessel of transmuting alchemies,</member>
                       <member>A glue that sticks together mind and life,</member>
                       <member>If Matter fails, all crumbling cracks and falls.</member>
                       <member>All upon Matter stands as on a rock.</member>
                       <member>Yet this security and guarantor</member>
                       <member>Pressed for credentials an impostor proves:</member>
                       <member>A cheat of substance where no substance is,</member>
                       <member>An appearance and a symbol and a nought,</member>
                       <member>Its forms have no original right to birth:</member>
                       <member>Its aspect of a fixed stability</member>
                       <member>Is the cover of a captive motion's swirl,</member>
                       <member>An order of the steps of Energy's dance</member>
                       <member>Whose footmarks leave for ever the same signs,</member>
                       <member>A concrete face of unsubstantial Time,</member>
                       <member>A trickle dotting the emptiness of Space:</member>
                       <member>A stable-seeming movement without change,</member>
                       <member>Yet change arrives and the last change is death.</member>
                       <member>What seemed most real once, is Nihil's show.</member>
                       <member>Its figures are snares that trap and prison the sense;</member>
                       <member>The beginningless Void was its artificer:</member>
                       <member>Nothing is there but aspects limned by Chance</member>
                       <member>And seeming shapes of seeming Energy.</member>
                       <member>All by Death's mercy breathe and live awhile,</member>
                       <member>All think and act by the Inconscient's grace.</member>
                       <member>Addict of the roseate luxury of thy thoughts,</member>
                       <member>Turn not thy gaze within thyself to look</member>
                       <member>At visions in the gleaming crystal, Mind,</member>
                       <member>Close not thy lids to dream the forms of Gods.</member>
                       <member>At last to open thy eyes consent and see</member>
                       <member>The stuff of which thou and the world are made.</member>
                       <member>Inconscient in the dumb inconscient Void</member>
                       <member>Inexplicably a moving world sprang forth:</member>
                       <member>Awhile secure, happily insensible,</member>
                       <member>It could not rest content with its own truth.</member>
                       <member>For something on its nescient breast was born</member>
                       <member>Condemned to see and know, to feel and love,</member>
                       <member>It watched its acts, imagined a soul within;</member>
                       <member>It groped for truth and dreamed of Self and God.</member>
                       <member>When all unconscious was, then all was well.</member>
                       <member>I, Death, was king and kept my regal state,</member>
                       <member>Designing my unwilled, unerring plan,</member>
                       <member>Creating with a calm insentient heart.</member>
                       <member>In my sovereign power of unreality</member>
                       <member>Obliging nothingness to take a form,</member>
                       <member>Infallibly my blind unthinking force</member>
                       <member>Making by chance a fixity like fate's,</member>
                       <member>By whim the formulas of Necessity,</member>
                       <member>Founded on the hollow ground of the Inane</member>
                       <member>The sure bizarrerie of Nature's scheme.</member>
                       <member>I curved the vacant ether into Space;</member>
                       <member>A huge expanding and contracting Breath</member>
                       <member>Harboured the fires of the universe:</member>
                       <member>I struck out the supreme original spark</member>
                       <member>And spread its sparse ranked armies through the Inane,</member>
                       <member>Manufactured the stars from the occult radiances,</member>
                       <member>Marshalled the platoons of the invisible dance;</member>
                       <member>I formed earth's beauty out of atom and gas,</member>
                       <member>And built from chemic plasm the living man.</member>
                       <member>Then Thought came in and spoiled the harmonious world:</member>
                       <member>Matter began to hope and think and feel,</member>
                       <member>Tissue and nerve bore joy and agony.</member>
                       <member>The inconscient cosmos strove to learn its task;</member>
                       <member>An ignorant personal God was born in Mind</member>
                       <member>And to understand invented reason's law,</member>
                       <member>The impersonal Vast throbbed back to man's desire,</member>
                       <member>A trouble rocked the great world's blind still heart</member>
                       <member>And Nature lost her wide immortal calm.</member>
                       <member>Thus came this warped incomprehensible scene</member>
                       <member>Of souls emmeshed in life's delight and pain</member>
                       <member>And Matter's sleep and Mind's mortality,</member>
                       <member>Of beings in Nature's prison waiting death</member>
                       <member>And consciousness left in seeking ignorance</member>
                       <member>And evolution's slow arrested plan.</member>
                       <member>This is the world in which thou mov'st, astray</member>
                       <member>In the tangled pathways of the human mind,</member>
                       <member>In the issueless circling of thy human life,</member>
                       <member>Searching for thy soul and thinking God is here.</member>
                       <member>But where is room for soul or place for God</member>
                       <member>In the brute immensity of a machine?</member>
                       <member>A transient Breath thou takest for thy soul,</member>
                       <member>Born from a gas, a plasm, a sperm, a gene,</member>
                       <member>A magnified image of man's mind for God,</member>
                       <member>A shadow of thyself thrown upon Space.</member>
                       <member>Interposed between the upper and nether Void,</member>
                       <member>Thy consciousness reflects the world around</member>
                       <member>In the distorting mirror of Ignorance</member>
                       <member>Or upwards turns to catch imagined stars.</member>
                       <member>Or if a half-Truth is playing with the earth</member>
                       <member>Throwing its light on a dark shadowy ground,</member>
                       <member>It touches only and leaves a luminous smudge.</member>
                       <member>Immortality thou claimest for thy spirit,</member>
                       <member>But immortality for imperfect man,</member>
                       <member>A god who hurts himself at every step,</member>
                       <member>Would be a cycle of eternal pain.</member>
                       <member>Wisdom and love thou claimest as thy right;</member>
                       <member>But knowledge in this world is error's mate,</member>
                       <member>A brilliant procuress of Nescience,</member>
                       <member>And human love a posturer on earth-stage</member>
                       <member>Who imitates with verve a faery dance.</member>
                       <member>An extract pressed from hard experience,</member>

                       <member>Has the harsh savour of a mortal draught:</member>

                       <member>He who would turn to God, must leave the world;</member>

                       <member>But Savitri replied to mighty Death:</member>

                       <member>It feels the high Transcendent's sunlike hands,</member>

                       <member>In the dim Night it lies alone with God.</member>
                       <member>My heart's strength can carry the grief of the universe</member>

                       <member>Its white tremendous orbit through God's peace.</member>

                       <member>And never lose the white spiritual touch,</member>
                       <member>The calm that broods in the deep Infinite."</member>
                       <member>He said, "Art thou indeed so strong, O heart,</member>
                       <member>O soul, so free? And canst thou gather then</member>

                       <member>Deepens the soul's response, brings nearer the goal."</member>
                       <member>Death the contemptuous Nihil answered her:</member>
                       <member>"So prove thy absolute force to the wise gods,</member>
                       <member>By choosing earthly joy! For self demand</member>
                       <member>And yet from self and its gross masks live free.</member>
                       <member>Then will I give thee all thy soul desires,</member>
                       <member>All the brief joys earth keeps for mortal hearts.</member>
                       <member>Only the one dearest wish that outweighs all,</member>
                       <member>Hard laws forbid and thy ironic fate.</member>
                       <member>My will once wrought remains unchanged through Time,</member>
                       <member>And Satyavan can never again be thine."</member>
                       <member>But Savitri replied to the vague Power:</member>
                       <member>"If the eyes of Darkness can look straight at Truth,</member>
                       <member>Look in my heart and, knowing what I am,</member>
                       <member>Give what thou wilt or what thou must, O Death.</member>
                       <member>Nothing I claim but Satyavan alone."</member>
                       <member>There was a hush as if of doubtful fates.</member>
                       <member>As one disdainful still who yields a point</member>
                       <member>Death bowed his sovereign head in cold assent:</member>
                       <member>"I give to thee, saved from death and poignant fate</member>
                       <member>Whatever once the living Satyavan</member>
                       <member>Desired in his heart for Savitri.</member>
                       <member>Bright noons I give thee and unwounded dawns,</member>
                       <member>Daughters of thy own shape in heart and mind,</member>
                       <member>Fair hero sons and sweetness undisturbed</member>
                       <member>Of union with thy husband dear and true.</member>
                       <member>And thou shalt harvest in thy joyful house</member>
                       <member>Felicity of thy surrounded eves.</member>
                       <member>Love shall bind by thee many gathered hearts.</member>
                       <member>The opposite sweetness in thy days shall meet</member>
                       <member>Of tender service to thy life's desired</member>
                       <member>And loving empire over all thy loved,</member>
                       <member>Two poles of bliss made one, O Savitri.</member>
                       <member>Return, O child, to thy forsaken earth."</member>
                       <member>But Savitri replied, "Thy gifts resist.</member>
                       <member>Earth cannot flower if lonely I return."</member>
                       <member>Then Death sent forth once more his angry cry,</member>
                       <member>As chides a lion his escaping prey:</member>

                       <member>Who thinkst that one man dead all joy must cease?</member>
                       <member>Hope not to be unhappy till the end:</member>
                       <member>For grief dies soon in the tired human heart;</member>
                       <member>Soon other guests the empty chambers fill.</member>
                       <member>A transient painting on a holiday's floor</member>
                       <member>Traced for a moment's beauty love was made.</member>
                       <member>Or if a voyager on the eternal trail,</member>
                       <member>Its objects fluent change in its embrace</member>
                       <member>Like waves to a swimmer upon infinite seas."</member>
                       <member>But Savitri replied to the vague god,</member>

                       <member>This change was in the godhead's far-flung voice;</member>
                       <member>His form of dread was altered and admitted</member>
                       <member>Our transient effort at eternity,</member>

                       <member>The great voice surging cried to Savitri:</member>

                       <member>Hasteners to action, violators of God</member>
                       <member>Are these great spirits who have too much love,</member>

                       <member>Dragged like a ship by bound leviathan</member>

                       <member>All moves, is in peril, anguished, torn, upheaved.</member>
                       <member>The hurrying aeons would stumble on too swift</member>
                       <member>If strength from heaven surprised the imperfect earth</member>

                       <member>The deities have screened their dreadful power:</member>
                       <member>God hides his thought and, even, he seems to err.</member>
                       <member>Be still and tardy in the slow wise world.</member>
                       <member>Mighty art thou with the dread goddess filled,</member>

                       <member>The dull fixity that binds inanimate things.</member>

                       <member>Man turns to a nobler walk, a master path.</member>

                       <member>Unworthy of Godhead in the original sleep.</member>
                       <member>I claim from Time my will's eternity,</member>
                       <member>God from his moments." Death replied to her,</member>

                       <member>And battle and bear agony of wounds</member>
                       <member>To grasp the trivial joys that earth can guard</member>
                       <member>In her small treasure-chest of passing things?</member>
                       <member>Child, hast thou trodden the gods beneath thy feet</member>
                       <member>Only to win poor shreds of earthly life</member>

                       <member>Eternal truth lives not with mortal men.</member>
                       <member>Or if she dwells within thy mortal heart,</member>

                       <member>Awhile the Shade survived defying heaven:</member>
                       <member>Assailing in front, oppressing from above,</member>
                       <member>A concrete mass of conscious power, he bore</member>
                       <member>The tyranny of her divine desire.</member>
                       <member>A pressure of intolerable force</member>
                       <member>Weighed on his unbowed head and stubborn breast;</member>
                       <member>Light like a burning tongue licked up his thoughts,</member>
                       <member>Light was a luminous torture in his heart,</member>
                       <member>Light coursed, a splendid agony, through his nerves;</member>
                       <member>His darkness muttered perishing in her blaze.</member>
                       <member>Her mastering Word commanded every limb</member>
                       <member>And left no room for his enormous will</member>
                       <member>That seemed pushed out into some helpless space</member>
                       <member>And could no more re-enter but left him void.</member>
                       <member>He called to Night but she fell shuddering back,</member>
                       <member>He called to Hell but sullenly it retired:</member>
                       <member>He turned to the Inconscient for support,</member>
                       <member>From which he was born, his vast sustaining self;</member>
                       <member>It drew him back towards boundless vacancy</member>
                       <member>As if by himself to swallow up himself:</member>
                       <member>He called to his strength, but it refused his call.</member>
                       <member>His body was eaten by light, his spirit devoured.</member>
                       <member>At last he knew defeat inevitable</member>
                       <member>And left crumbling the shape that he had worn,</member>
                       <member>Abandoning hope to make man's soul his prey</member>
                       <member>And force to be mortal the immortal spirit.</member>
                       <member>Afar he fled shunning her dreaded touch</member>
                       <member>And refuge took in the retreating Night.</member>
                       <member>In the dream twilight of that symbol world</member>
                       <member>The dire universal Shadow disappeared</member>
                       <member>Vanishing into the Void from which it came.</member>
                       <member>As if deprived of its original cause,</member>

                       <member>A mute invisible and translucent wall.</member>
                       <member>In the long blank moment's pause nothing could move:</member>
                       <member>All waited on the unknown inscrutable Will.</member>

                       <member>In an ineffable world she lived fulfilled.</member>
                       <member>An energy of the triune Infinite,</member>
                       <member>In a measureless Reality she dwelt,</member>
                       <member>A rapture and a being and a force,</member>
                       <member>A linked and myriad-motioned plenitude,</member>
                       <member>A virgin unity, a luminous spouse,</member>
                       <member>Housing a multitudinous embrace</member>

                       <member>A wonderful mother of unnumbered souls.</member>
                       <member>All things she knew, all things imagined or willed:</member>
                       <member>Her ear was opened to ideal sound,</member>

                       <member>A thousand doors of oneness was her heart.</member>
                       <member>A crypt and sanctuary of brooding light</member>
                       <member>Appeared, the last recess of things beyond.</member>
                       <member>Then in its rounds the enormous fiat paused,</member>
                       <member>Silence gave back to the Unknowable</member>
                       <member>All it had given. Still was her listening thought.</member>
                       <member>The form of things had ceased within her soul.</member>
                       <member>Invisible that perfect godhead now.</member>
                       <member>Around her some tremendous spirit lived,</member>
                       <member>Mysterious flame around a melting pearl,</member>
                       <member>And in the phantom of abolished Space</member>
                       <member>There was a voice unheard by ears that cried:</member>
                       <member>"Choose, spirit, thy supreme choice not given again;</member>
                       <member>For now from my highest being looks at thee</member>
                       <member>The nameless formless peace where all things rest.</member>
                       <member>In a happy vast sublime cessation know,—</member>
                       <member>An immense extinction in eternity,</member>
                       <member>A point that disappears in the infinite,—</member>
                       <member>Felicity of the extinguished flame,</member>
                       <member>Last sinking of a wave in a boundless sea,</member>
                       <member>End of the trouble of thy wandering thoughts,</member>
                       <member>Close of the journeying of thy pilgrim soul.</member>
                       <member>Accept, O music, weariness of thy notes,</member>
                       <member>O stream, wide breaking of thy channel banks."</member>
                       <member>The moments fell into eternity.</member>
                       <member>But someone yearned within a bosom unknown</member>
                       <member>And silently the woman's heart replied:</member>
                       <member>"Thy peace, O Lord, a boon within to keep</member>
                       <member>Amid the roar and ruin of wild Time</member>
                       <member>For the magnificent soul of man on earth.</member>
                       <member>Thy calm, O Lord, that bears thy hands of joy."</member>
                       <member>Limitless like ocean round a lonely isle</member>
                       <member>A second time the eternal cry arose:</member>
                       <member>"Wide open are the ineffable gates in front.</member>
                       <member>My spirit leans down to break the knot of earth,</member>
                       <member>Amorous of oneness without thought or sign</member>
                       <member>To cast down wall and fence, to strip heaven bare,</member>
                       <member>See with the large eye of infinity,</member>
                       <member>Unweave the stars and into silence pass."</member>
                       <member>In an immense and world-destroying pause</member>
                       <member>She heard a million creatures cry to her.</member>
                       <member>Through the tremendous stillness of her thoughts</member>
                       <member>Immeasurably the woman's nature spoke:</member>
                       <member>"Thy oneness, Lord, in many approaching hearts,</member>
                       <member>My sweet infinity of thy numberless souls."</member>
                       <member>Mightily retreating like a sea in ebb</member>
                       <member>A third time swelled the great admonishing call:</member>
                       <member>"I spread abroad the refuge of my wings.</member>
                       <member>Out of its incommunicable deeps</member>
                       <member>My power looks forth of mightiest splendour, stilled</member>
                       <member>Into its majesty of sleep, withdrawn</member>
                       <member>Above the dreadful whirlings of the world."</member>
                       <member>A sob of things was answer to the voice,</member>
                       <member>And passionately the woman's heart replied:</member>
                       <member>"Thy energy, Lord, to seize on woman and man,</member>
                       <member>To take all things and creatures in their grief</member>
                       <member>And gather them into a mother's arms."</member>
                       <member>Solemn and distant like a seraph's lyre</member>
                       <member>A last great time the warning sound was heard:</member>
                       <member>"I open the wide eye of solitude</member>
                       <member>To uncover the voiceless rapture of my bliss,</member>
                       <member>Where in a pure and exquisite hush it lies</member>
                       <member>Motionless in its slumber of ecstasy,</member>
                       <member>Resting from the sweet madness of the dance</member>
                       <member>Out of whose beat the throb of hearts was born."</member>
                       <member>Breaking the Silence with appeal and cry</member>
                       <member>A hymn of adoration tireless climbed,</member>
                       <member>A music beat of winged uniting souls,</member>
                       <member>Then all the woman yearningly replied:</member>
                       <member>"Thy embrace which rends the living knot of pain,</member>
                       <member>Thy joy, O Lord, in which all creatures breathe,</member>
                       <member>Thy magic flowing waters of deep love,</member>
                       <member>Thy sweetness give to me for earth and men."</member>

                       <member>And the stupendous summit self of things,</member>

                       <member>Our wedded walk through life begins anew,</member>

                       <member>Let us go through this new world that is the same,</member>
                       <member>For it is given back, but it is known,</member>
                       <member>A playing-ground and dwelling-house of God</member>

                       <member>Sweetly to find himself again by love,</member>

                       <member>We have each other found, O Satyavan,</member>

                       <member>Two rays that travel to the original Light.</member>
                       <member>To lead man's soul towards truth and God we are born,</member>
                       <member>To draw the chequered scheme of mortal life</member>
                       <member>Into some semblance of the Immortal's plan,</member>
                       <member>To shape it closer to an image of God,</member>
                       <member>A little nearer to the Idea divine."</member>
                       <member>She closed her arms about his breast and head</member>
                       <member>As if to keep him on her bosom worn</member>
                       <member>For ever through the journeying of the years.</member>
                       <member>So for a while they stood entwined, their kiss</member>
                       <member>And passion-tranced embrace a meeting-point</member>
                       <member>In their commingling spirits one for ever,</member>
                       <member>Two-souled, two-bodied for the joys of Time.</member>
                       <member>Then hand in hand they left that solemn place</member>
                       <member>Full now of mute unusual memories,</member>

                       <member>Round them the afternoon to evening changed;</member>
                       <member>Light slipped down to the brightly sleeping verge,</member>

                       <member>A thoughtful prophecy of lyric dawn.</member>

                       <member>A kingdom seeking came and heaven's rays.</member>
                       <member>But where wast thou? Thou hast tormented gladness</member>
                       <member>With fear's dull shadow, O my child, my life.</member>
                       <member>What danger kept thee for the darkening woods?</member>
                       <member>Or how could pleasure in her ways forget</member>
                       <member>That useless orbs without thee are my eyes</member>
                       <member>Which only for thy sake rejoice at light?</member>
                       <member>Not like thyself was this done, Savitri,</member>
                       <member>Who ledst not back thy husband to our arms,</member>
                       <member>Knowing with him beside me only is taste</member>
                       <member>In food and for his touch evening and morn</member>
                       <member>I live content with my remaining days."</member>
                       <member>But Satyavan replied with smiling lips,</member>
                       <member>"Lay all on her; she is the cause of all.</member>
                       <member>With her enchantments she has twined me round.</member>
                       <member>Behold, at noon leaving this house of clay</member>
                       <member>I wandered in far-off eternities,</member>
                       <member>Yet still, a captive in her golden hands,</member>
                       <member>I tread your little hillock called green earth</member>
                       <member>And in the moments of your transient sun</member>
                       <member>Live glad among the busy works of men."</member>
                       <member>Then all eyes turned their wondering looks where stood,</member>
                       <member>A deepening redder gold upon her cheeks,</member>
                       <member>With lowered lids the noble lovely child,</member>
                       <member>And one consenting thought moved every breast.</member>
                       <member>"What gleaming marvel of the earth or skies</member>

            <para>
                SAVITRI began as a narrative poem of moderate length based on a legend told in the Mahabharata. Sri Aurobindo considered the story to be originally "one of the many symbolic myths of the Vedic cycle". Bringing out its symbolism and charging it progressively with his own spiritual vision, he turned 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> into the epic it is today.
            </para>
            <para>
                By the time it was published, some passages had gone through dozens of drafts. Sri Aurobindo explained how he wrote the poem: "I used 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> as a means of ascension. I began with it on a certain mental level, each time I could reach a higher level I rewrote from that level.... In fact 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> has not been regarded by me as a poem to be written and finished, but as a field of experimentation to see how far poetry could be written from one's own yogic consciousness and how that could be made creative."
            </para>
            <para>
                The following outline of the composition and publication of 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> draws upon all existing manuscripts and other textual materials, supplemented by the author's letters on the poem. In brief, 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> took shape through three major phases.
            </para>
            <para>
                (1) Before 1920, Sri Aurobindo made a number of drafts of a narrative poem retelling in an original way the tale of Savitri and Satyavan. Its last version had a plan of eight books in two parts; the books were not divided into cantos. (2) In the 1930s, he set about converting this narrative poem into an epic. For a long time he concentrated on the description of Aswapati's Yoga prior to the birth of Savitri, creating by 1945 a new Part One with three books and many cantos. (3) In the last phase, besides revising Part One for publication, he reworked and enlarged most of the books written in the first period. He added a book on the Yoga of Savitri, making twelve books and forty-nine cantos in all and completing Parts Two and Three.

            <para>
                Sri Aurobindo read the Savitri-episode of the Mahabharata in Sanskrit while he was in Baroda. He expressed appreciation of its style in his "Notes on the Mahabharata", written around 1901. But a report that he worked on an English poem on the subject at this time is not supported by his own statements or any documents that survive. If there was a Baroda 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis>, which is doubtful, it was among the writings of which Sri Aurobindo wrote in 1933, "Most of all that has disappeared into the unknown in the whirlpools and turmoil of my political career." Even assuming that such a poem was written in Baroda, for all practical purposes 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> as we know it was commenced in Pondicherry.
            </para>
            <para>
                The opening of the first known version is dated "August 8th 9th / 1916". Further dates occur later on in the draft. From the death of Satyavan to the end of Savitri's debate with Death, the manuscript is marked every few pages with dates from a three-day period, 17-19 October. After this, the consecutive narration breaks off and the notebook contains only disconnected passages. Some of these are sketches for the conclusion of the poem. Most of them go back over what was already written. They represent the beginning of the long process of rewriting which was to continue until 1950.
            </para>
            <para>
                This earliest surviving manuscript of 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> shows every sign of being the first draft. It is one of the few versions that Sri Aurobindo dated. But even if precise dates cannot be assigned to them, the manuscripts of the poem can almost always be placed in a definite order after a careful comparison. This is because changes made when one draft was revised were usually incorporated in the next draft, which would then be further altered and most often expanded.
            </para>
            <para>
                Initially the poem was short enough not to require division into books or cantos. Its sections were separated only by blank lines. But soon Sri Aurobindo was dividing it into "Book I", ending with the death of Satyavan, and "Book II", recounting Savitri's debate with and victory over Death. Next he adopted a scheme of six cantos and an epilogue. The canto titles were: Love, Fate, Death, Night, Twilight and Day.
            </para>
            <para>
                After making a few drafts in cantos, he started substituting the word "book" for "canto". There were now six books with the same names as the former cantos. Meanwhile the larger division had reappeared as two parts, "Earth" and "Beyond". At first each part comprised three books, not counting the epilogue. But before long, the rapidly growing first book was broken up into two. The second book kept the name "Love"; the first was renamed "Quest".
            </para>
            <para>
                A manuscript beginning with "Book I / Quest" has the title "Sâvithrî: A Tale and a Vision". (In early versions, "Sâvithrî" was the usual spelling of the heroine's name.) Sri Aurobindo referred to this stage in the poem's history in a letter of 1936: " 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> was originally written many years ago before the Mother came [ 
                <emphasis>i.e., before the Mother's final arrival in 1920</emphasis>], as a narrative poem in two parts, Part I Earth and Part II Beyond... each of four books—or rather Part II consisted of three books and an epilogue."
            </para>
            <para>
                This was the plan of 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> at the end of the first phase of its composition. But the last manuscript actually completed was in six cantos and an epilogue. After "books" replaced the "cantos" and the number of books increased, some books were worked over several times. Others were hardly touched. There is a partial draft of "Book III / Death", for example; there is none from the stage when "Death" would have been the fourth book. After 1945 when Sri Aurobindo incorporated material from the early poem into what was by then a full-fledged epic, he sometimes went back to a manuscript of the six "cantos" as his starting-point.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> was apparently put aside during most of the 1920s, a period when Sri Aurobindo did little writing. The first evidence of its resumption is found in a letter of 1931. Here he speaks of a radical change in the conception and scope of the poem. Already the subtitle, "A Legend and a Symbol", is present in his mind: "There is a previous draft, the result of the many retouchings of which somebody told you; but in that form it would not have been a '<emphasis>magnum opus</emphasis>' at all. Besides, it would have been a legend and not a symbol. I therefore started recasting the whole thing; only the best passages and lines of the old draft will remain, altered so as to fit into the new frame."
            </para>
            <para>
                Throughout the thirties and early forties, it was primarily Book One that was affected by this recasting. At first this book was still called "Quest". It extended as far as Savitri's arrival at "The Destined Meeting-Place" (the eventual title of Book Five, Canto One). But in the early thirties, the brief description of the Yoga of King Aswapati near the beginning swelled to hundreds of lines. What was to become the second and longest book of the epic, "The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds", began to take shape.
            </para>
            <para>
                In a letter of 1936, Sri Aurobindo mentioned a new first book, the "Book of Birth", carved out of the overgrown "Quest". Another letter of the same year reveals the internal structure of this book. It was "divided into sections and the larger sections into subsections". Up to this point, the books had been divided only into passages separated by spaces, as many cantos are now. As these sections increased in length, they were recognised as formal units and began to be named and numbered. Section marks (§) were usually put before and after the numbers.
            </para>
            <para>
                The Book of Birth, whose last section related the birth and childhood of Savitri, was still disproportionately long and was constantly growing. Early in 1937, Sri Aurobindo expressed his intention of rearranging the opening books into a Book of Beginnings and a Book of Birth and Quest.
            </para>
            <para>
                Progress on the poem was intermittent in the thirties due to Sri Aurobindo's heavy load of correspondence. From the end of 1938 to mid-1940, work on 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> was suspended. But on 6 September 1942, a 110-page draft of the Book of Beginnings was completed. The fourth of its eight sections, "The Ascent through the Worlds", accounted for more than half the total length and had twelve subsections. In the next version, this section became Book Two with the title it now has. The last four sections were grouped into Book Three, "The Book of the Divine Mother".
            </para>
            <para>
                The second phase in the composition of 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> reached its culmination when the first three books were written out in two columns on large sheets. Many passages, including the whole of the first and third books and much of the second, went through two or more drafts in this form. The last complete manuscript is dated "May 7. 1944" at the end.
            </para>
            <para>
                It was while revising this manuscript that Sri Aurobindo reintroduced the word "canto" which he had not used since an early stage, applying it to the former "sections" of the books. At this point the third section of Book One, "The Yoga of the King", was turned into Cantos 3-5 with their present titles. The three opening books were for the first time identified as "Part One".
            </para>
            <para>
                The two-column manuscript is the last continuous version of Part One in Sri Aurobindo's hand. But he went on reworking Book One and passages throughout Book Two. For this purpose he began using small note-pads whose sheets, containing new or rewritten matter, could be torn out and pinned to the principal manuscript at the appropriate places.
            </para>
            <para>
                By the mid-1940s, Sri Aurobindo's eyesight was failing and his handwriting was becoming less and less legible. He needed the help of a scribe in order to put Books 1-3 into a finished form, take up the long-neglected later books, and prepare 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> for publication. This third phase of its composition saw periods of rapid and decisive progress. But it was to be interrupted the month before Sri Aurobindo's passing, a little short of definitive completion.
            </para>
            <para>
                Much had still to be done with the first part. Sri Aurobindo asked the scribe to read the last version to him. After dictating changes, insertions and transpositions, he had his assistant copy it into a large ledger. This copy was meticulously revised before being given to another disciple for typing. The typescript in its turn was read out to Sri Aurobindo and similarly revised. Heavily revised pages were often retyped. The same process was sometimes repeated, especially in the later cantos of Book Two, where three typed copies exist.
            </para>
            <para>
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> now began to appear in print, though not yet in its final form. The first and third books were brought out canto by canto from August 1946 to February 1948 in journals connected with the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. They were also published in fascicles identical to the journal instalments. The second book was issued in 1947 and 1948 in two large fascicles.
            </para>
            <para>
                Differences between the typescripts and the printed texts show that proofs of the latter must have been revised in detail by Sri Aurobindo. Afterwards a copy of each fascicle was read to him. Even at this advanced stage, he made extensive alterations and added new lines and passages.
            </para>
            <para>
                Meanwhile he had turned his attention to the later books. The plan of Parts Two and Three resembled that of the pre-1920 poem, whose books had been divided into "Earth" (Quest, Love, Fate, Death) and "Beyond" (Night, Twilight, Day, Epilogue). By 1945, however, most of these books had remained untouched for twenty-five years. Everything written under what Sri Aurobindo termed in 1934 "the old insufficient inspiration" would have to be thoroughly recast. Moreover, a new book had been conceived: The Book of Yoga. Destined to become one of the longest in the epic, six of its seven cantos were still to be drafted.
            </para>
            <para>
                The material in the Book of Birth and Quest had for a long time been included in Book One. As a result it had gone through several drafts in the 1930s, while other books lay dormant. The last book to be set aside, it was also the first to be taken up again. One manuscript of it precedes the 1942 draft of the Book of Beginnings. The final version was evidently written within a year or so of this. Since much work had already been done on it, this book needed less modification than others. Yet especially in the first two cantos, Sri Aurobindo dictated substantial changes and additions when he revised the manuscript and typescript.
            </para>
            <para>
                The Book of Love shared to some extent in the good fortune of the previous book during the thirties and early forties. But the last version in Sri Aurobindo's hand, in the notebook which starts with his final manuscript of Book Four, breaks off in the middle of the second canto. The continuation is in the scribe's hand. It was copied there probably two or three years later when the systematic revision of the later books had been undertaken.
            </para>
            <para>
                The remainder of this notebook contains the scribe's copy of Books Six, Nine and Ten, reworked from the corresponding books in the old poem, expanded, divided into cantos and renamed "The Book of Fate", "The Book of Eternal Night" and "The Book of the Double Twilight". Once Sri Aurobindo had done enough with Books Four and Five for the time being, it appears that he took up these three books one after the other. After Book Six, he skipped to Book Nine, postponing extensive work on Books Seven and Eight. However, he may have revised slightly the versions of the original third book or canto, "Death", on which Book Seven, Canto One and the present Book of Death are based.
            </para>
            <para>
                Drafts of "Fate", "Night" and "Twilight" had been written on one side of loose sheets of paper, like other cantos or books in several early versions of 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis>. This facilitated the complex process of revision which was now set in motion. When the space between lines and in the margins was filled up, the backs of the pages were available. In extreme cases, whole cantos were written on the reverse sides of the pages with little relation to what was on the front.
            </para>
            <para>
                Sri Aurobindo drafted many passages in small note-pads of the type used for Part One. Lines for Books Five and Nine and large portions of Books Six and Ten were written in this way. Canto Two of Book Six was almost entirely new. The passages drafted for it were transferred by the scribe to another note-pad, with changes dictated by Sri Aurobindo at the time.
            </para>
            <para>
                The metamorphosis which the Book of Fate underwent included the introduction of the Queen: some of Aswapati's later speeches in the old version were now given to her, and her long speech at the beginning of Canto Two was composed. Sri Aurobindo worked on this book in 1946 and brought it close to its final form. But he was to return to it at the end and add significantly to the second canto.
            </para>
            <para>
                An early manuscript of "Night" was substantially revised and turned into the two cantos of Book Nine. But in this instance Sri Aurobindo seems to have found the pre-1920 version more adequate than usual. He left it intact to a greater extent than in the case of other books on which he bestowed his full attention in the 1940s. Only the Book of Death and the Epilogue stayed closer to their original shape, but he always intended to come back to these.
            </para>
            <para>
                On the other hand, old drafts of "Twilight" formed merely a starting-point for the four cantos of Book Ten. The speeches of Savitri and Death were refashioned, rearranged in their order, and new ones inserted. As he proceeded from one canto to the next, Sri Aurobindo added longer and longer passages that were quite new. The first section of Canto One, the long speech of Death which ends Canto Two, all but the last few pages of Canto Three, and most of Canto Four—especially its second half, where Savitri finally triumphs over Death—owe little or nothing to any early version.
            </para>
            <para>
                In a letter of 22 April 1947, Sri Aurobindo summarised the status of the various books of the second and third parts. Books Four, Five, Six, Nine and Ten had by then "been completed, in a general way, with a sufficient finality of the whole form but subject to final changes in detail". The other four books were far from even a provisional completion.
            </para>
            <para>
                A "drastic recasting of the last two books" was felt to be needed and "only a part of the eleventh" had been subjected to that process. But a yet larger task lay ahead, the splitting up of the original Book of Death and the writing of the new cantos that would go into the Book of Yoga. In his letter of April 1947 Sri Aurobindo did not say what he planned to do next. But there are reasons to believe that, rather than going on directly from Book Ten to Book Eleven, he now retraced his steps to Book Seven.
            </para>
            <para>
                The description of Savitri's Yoga, complementing that of Aswapati's Yoga in Part One, was drafted in a thick notebook whose first hundred pages are filled with drafts for Book Ten, Canto Four. By March 1947, even before finishing the tenth book, Sri Aurobindo had begun to use this notebook for preliminary work on Book Seven. The scribe was not asked to copy the semi-legible handwriting of the draft. Instead, Sri Aurobindo dictated to him the lines he had jotted down, often in a somewhat different form. The dictated version was extensively revised before a typed copy was made.
            </para>
            <para>
                The Book of Yoga had four cantos at first. But the second, "The Parable of the Finding of the Soul", grew to an inordinate length. When the typescript was revised, it was broken up into Cantos 2-5, from "The Parable of the Search for the Soul" to "The Finding of the Soul". Revision of the typed copy was so elaborate in places (as elsewhere, especially in Book Six, Canto Two and in Book Eleven) that sometimes there was not enough room on the page. The scribe would then write on separate slips of paper, attaching as many as ten of these to a single page of the typescript.

                Canto One of Book Seven has a different background. Early in the evolution of 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis>, the third canto of the poem (later, the third book) was called "Death". It described the year leading up to Satyavan's death as well as the fatal day itself. The latest version, with the heading "Book III", is incomplete and stops before the last day. Sri Aurobindo used this manuscript as far as it goes when he put Book Seven, Canto One into its present form.

                The second half of an earlier "Canto III" had to be used as the manuscript for Book Eight. It was revised slightly near the beginning and a substantial passage was dictated at the end. Sri Aurobindo apparently intended to return to the Book of Death, but this was not to be.

                On 20 July 1948 he was compelled to admit, "even 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> has very much slowed down and I am only making the last revisions of the First Part already completed; the other two parts are just now in cold storage." When the later parts were taken up again, the most important task remaining was evidently to bring the almost untouched eleventh book up to the level of what preceded it. The old "Book VII / Day" on which it would be based was among the best-developed portions of the early poem. But after thirty years, Sri Aurobindo had more to say at the climax of 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis>.

                There was also the Epilogue; but the contemplated revision of this must have seemed less essential to the total design. Although a few pages of an early version were significantly retouched at some stage, the concluding two sections of the Epilogue stayed almost exactly as they were. Thus the closing pages of the epic, like most of Book Eight, remained as a sample of the style in which 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> was originally written.

                Near the end of his life, Sri Aurobindo's eyesight was so poor that he no longer wrote at all. He made no more drafts for 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> and the work proceeded entirely by dictation. Virtually the whole revision of "The Book of Everlasting Day" was done in this purely oral manner and may be inferred to belong to this late period. There exist only a few pages of drafts for it in Sri Aurobindo's hand, found in note-pads he used around 1946. He was probably referring to these when he wrote in 1947 that he had already recast "part of the eleventh" book.

                Book Eleven culminates in the longest continuous dictated passage in 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis>. The passage was written by the scribe in a separate note-pad and seems to have no antecedent in any previous draft. This is the section which begins on p. 702 with "Descend to life...", and ends at the bottom of p. 710 with "This earthly life become the life divine." Regarding Sri Aurobindo's dictation in Book Eleven, the scribe reports that "line after line began to flow from his lips like a smooth and gentle stream and it was on the next day that a revision was done to get the link for further continuation."

                By this time, cantos of Parts Two and Three were coming out in journal instalments and fascicles like those of Part One. Most of the cantos of Books Four, Five, Six and Nine were published in this way in 1949-50. Unlike the fascicles of the first part, they were not revised afterwards by Sri Aurobindo.

                But in 1948, an extract from Book Six, Canto Two had already been printed in the 
                <emphasis>Sri Aurobindo Mandir Annual</emphasis>. An offprint of this was read to Sri Aurobindo and the changes he dictated were incorporated in a retyped copy. The painstaking revision of this second typescript was reportedly the last work he did on 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis>. A short paragraph before the concluding description of Narad's departure was the final passage to receive detailed attention in November 1950, less than a month before Sri Aurobindo's passing. The thirteen-line paragraph was expanded to the seventy-two lines beginning "Queen, strive no more to change the secret will...."

                Sri Aurobindo revised the proofs of the first edition of Part One, making numerous final changes and adding more than a hundred new lines. In 1950, Part One of 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> appeared in book form. Parts Two and Three could not be similarly revised. They came out in 1951 in a second volume, thus completing the first edition.

                The second edition was issued in 1954 in one volume under the imprint of the Sri Aurobindo International University Centre. Some obvious errors in the text of the first edition were emended at this time. A few of these were evidently due to the mishearing of Sri Aurobindo's dictation.

                In 1968, the first edition of Part One was reprinted with some new textual corrections. The third complete edition (1970) contained further emendations. Comprising Volumes 28 and 29 of the Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library, it was also brought out as a single volume in a reduced format. This was reprinted a number of times between 1973 and 1990. Several typographical and other errors were rectified in the 1976 impression.

                The fourth, critically revised edition appeared in 1993. This edition was the outcome of a systematic comparison of the printed text of 
                <emphasis>Savitri</emphasis> with the manuscripts. Each line was traced through all stages of copying, typing and printing in which errors could have occurred. Readings found to have come about through inaccurate transcription or misprinting were corrected. Accidentally omitted lines were restored to the text. This has resulted in a very slight increase in the length of the poem to its present 23,837 lines.

                The text of the present, electronic, edition (1999) is identical to the text of the CWSA edition. As the page breaks in the CWSA edition are almost everywhere identical to the page breaks in the SABCL edition, the SABCL page numbers have not been given separately for this book.
